{"6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed

to make these hi everybody today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears make with these cute little gummy bear trays I got these off of ebay and I'll leave you the link below it comes with even this little dropper so you can put it in there easy we're gonna make three different flavors so the first one we're gonna make is blueberry wait 1/2 a cup of blueberry puree I just warm them up a little bit some frozen berries and then I blended them in my blender and it makes perfect PRA like this okay so we're gonna warm up in a saucepan the blueberry puree 1/2 cup and you add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice so I was just gonna blend this up and then we're gonna add the honey when you need 2 tablespoons of the honey like that we're just gonna melt this together really nice and then we're gonna add the gelatin right now I need to add the 3 tablespoons of gelatin and just kind of spread it around so it doesn't clump up in a spot okay just mix that up until it gets kind of glossy and all the Delta mix is off okay this one looks ready okay now we're gonna make an orange juice flavor orange one so we're gonna use a cup of orange juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of honey and stir that up and now we're going to add the gelatin again three tablespoons of gelatin and stir that up till it's dissolved and it's nicely coat it together and it should look a little bit glossy so just cook it up for a little bit okay that one's ready now we're gonna do the last flavor we have strawberry all right we put the strawberries puree in there half a cup of water a tablespoon of lemon juice and again two tablespoons of honey okay on three tablespoons of gelatin that's it stir it up really good let it cook up to dissolve all the way okay that's it now I let the three flavors cool down okay I've got my trays ready I put them on top of cookie sheets so they won't be so floppy because we're gonna put them in the freezer so I'll just go ahead and fill up your flavors here I'm going to start with the orange one and I did not strain the pulp out of my oranges so we'll still have that in the gummy bears so if you want to strain yours that's fine but I did not okay now we're gonna do this strawberry too much okay okay now we're gonna do the blueberry okay if you don't have a gummy bear molds you can use any kind of pan as long as you line it I got it's a wax paper and then I'll the wax paper you can pour it in there and then once they are cooled you can pop them out I'm just have so much left over I'm just gonna mix them together kind of make like a mixed berry now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all these in the freezer and they have to freeze for about 30 minutes now if you didn't have a mold and you did it like this just let it freeze first and you could chop them up into whatever shape you want or if you have the molds that's fine you just pop them in just like this and the cookie sheet or if you don't have those molds you could use any kind of silicon molds that you have I have these ones silicones and I have these ice cubes I only have the silicone on the bottom I can't really show you now has silicone on the bottom so that they'll pop out so any one of these methods will work if you want to just try it ahead of time you don't have the gummy bear molds this you can try it like this and these I got on eBay like I said they were eight dollars and I'll leave the link in the description down below if you want to check these out they're totally a good buy so I these I got 200 gummy bears for seven dollars so that's pretty good and I came with their droppers okay so now we're just gonna put them in the freezer like this for 30 minutes and this is how they turned out we got the Stars and the leaves in strawberry and the blueberry flavor and these are the gummi bears whole pile of them here they're really small cute perfect size little gummies and then these are the ones that we had on the tree cuz we didn't have any cut out and I just cut them into cubes shape I'm they're perfect - they're really nice you could try any one of the shapes or if you have something else go ahead and try it and our favorite flavor was these strawberry ones here so let's you try it and tell me which flavor you guys like and like subscribe", "2_mDkLjlTCw": "so what is the best snack to eat at the movies say it with me popcorn but gummy bears are close second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy

February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "nzz5J9B1GC8": "hey hey hey good-looking I'm so glad that you came to my kitchen today just sit there and see what we all have cooking well grab ahold and I swing right back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little children remember this is a medicine and we should treat it as a medicine now if you'd like to just saw in here today please give me a big ol thumbs up if you're a new subscriber welcome to my channel if you're not yet subscribed go up hit that subscribe button tap that little bell that way always be

bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall

[Music]", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check

myths about cbd gummy bears who'd have thought it gummy bears and cbd ending up not only being used together in the same sentence but actually in the same product it seems that there is little left in the world that we should be surprised about but before we get too cozy about the combination of cbd and gummy bears which all sound very innocent and sweet pun intended there are three myths surrounding them that we feel ought to be blown apart first of all cbd gummy bears do not contain the same amounts of cannabinoid some gummy bears have five milligrams of cbd in them while others have 15 milligrams now that's a huge difference in potential potency what is a good idea apart from reading the ingredient section on the bottle or packet very closely is to try and ascertain what strain of cannabis plant the cbd came from and if you can't do that at the very least try and find out how the cbd was extracted from it second cbd gummy bears do not offer fast relief contrary to what many say how do we know this well if you watched our video on cooking with cbd and the mistakes you can make there you'd understand why it only takes a few seconds to feel the effects when smoking cannabis because the cannabinoids in the cannabis enter the bloodstream almost instantly however when swallowed any form of cbd has to be ingested and then the cbd is absorbed into the bloodstream usually after a delay of approximately two hours now correct us if you think we're wrong but to us that isn't rapid thirdly and finally not all cbd gummies are safe to take the reason they are not safe isn't because of the cbd but more the case of where the cbd comes from now that cannabis can be legally grown and cbd oil can be used in certain products agriculture has begun to do what it knows best increase crops through heavy use of pesticides the problem is those pesticides tend to end up in the cbd oil that's then used to make gummy bears many pesticides are known to be carcinogens while others can have adverse effects on the body's organs if you want to take a gummy bear that is a bit safer then take one without any cbd in it though that isn't totally safe either as gummy bears are full of sugar and it is well known that too much sugar is bad for you the truth is virtually everything is bad for you if you take too much of it so use cbd gummy bears wisely and do your research and homework before you buy any we'd love to know if you've tried any we'd also love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to

welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "lbSDrgHGcDY": "welcome back today we are making healthy gummies the recipe is super simple all you have to do is add a third of a cup of fruit juice two tablespoons of honey and then I like to also add in two teaspoons or two packets of stevia you can also add in two teaspoons of granulated sugar or you can omit that stuff I bring that to a boil and then pour it into a bowl to let it cool while the mixture cools I hydrate 1 tablespoon of unflavored gelatin with one tablespoon of room-temperature water I mix that into my slightly cooled fruit juice mixture and once the gelatin is fully dissolved you can add it into your molds the really fun thing about this recipe is you can use so many different flavors of Fruit Chews to create tons of different flavors of gummies one batch makes about 70 small gummy bears but it can vary based on the size of the molds that you're using before you pipe the mixture into your mold it's a great idea to set them on some type of flat baking sheet to make them easy to move into the fridge it's also really important that you have a pipette like this to fill the molds most of these silicon molds that you can get online come with one but if you don't have one it's important that you do get one it's almost impossible to do this with the spoon you also want to make sure you filled your molds all the way to the top almost to the point where you can see the surface tension if you under fill them your gummy bears are gonna be really thin and aren't gonna really have the right shape that a classic gummy bear has I made 5 different batches of gummy berries using a bunch of different fruit juices including apple orange grapefruit juice pomegranate juice and black cherry juice and the juice is what actually colors these gummy bears as well so it's really fun to create such beautiful looking gummies without any artificial food coloring I found that chilling my molds in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes is enough time for the gummy bears to set and they pop pretty easily out of the molds it does take a bit of time to get all of them out but it's totally worth it if you don't want to make gummy bears you can also make other shapes so I used a seashell mold here and I also had kind of a scary skull mold from Halloween and the gummy mixture worked great in that as well so don't feel limited to gummy berries you can definitely get creative with this you can also adjust the taste by altering how much honey or how much additional sweetener you add so if you like things a little bit sweeter you might want to add some more sugar stevia or if you like things to taste really natural you can totally skip adding that or reduce the amount of honey thank you guys so much for watching if you want to make your own gummies the recipe is also up on shale sweets calm", "FUF7LQdscFo": "make your gummy candies better with science I think we're stretching the science a bit we just really wanted to make gummy bears we are using science to make the best gummy candies if it's your first time watching make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of the fun we have all the ingredients we need and as soon as we put on our safety glasses we have the go-ahead from our Easter Island overlords I'm not entirely comfortable with the implication that wouldn't be safe unless specifically told to be by someone in authority welcome to the real world sister anyways what kind of recipe are we gonna be using cuz there are a lot of gummy candy recipes we are going to be making all of them or five whichever one comes first so basically we'll just have buckets and buckets of gummy candies just sitting here waiting to be eaten yes no no eating the scientific samples unless for documentation purposes strangely the same principle applies when working with mercury samples all the different recipes call for a few of the same ingredients namely water which we'll get later gelatin and some sort of flavoring but there seems to be no consensus on which recipe is the best we will also need something to put the mixture into so that it forms nice gummy shapes so we've got some Lego molds that I got on Amazon and we have some classics like gummy worms and gummy bears and also some fish themed ones let's start off with method number one the one popularized by the king of random we need half a cup of cold water yes it doesn't have to be cold and pour in a quarter cup of corn syrup stir until smooth the theory behind the corn syrup is that it gives the gummies a smoother texture then mix in two packets of gelatin and one package of gelatin give it a few minutes to allow the gelatin to bloom and stir it occasionally heat the mixture up on medium to low and keep stirring occasionally for around 5 minutes when the syrup is liquefied pour it directly into a mold of whatever size you want let it sit for 10 minutes and then skim the top foam off we are using 2 different methods to prep our silicon molds the first method is using some canola oil cooking spray the second method is to sprinkle some cornstarch directly into the mold we are using some clean ketchup containers to squirt into the molds let it sit for around 5 hours then enjoy method number two the something-something fruit method this one is super easy just 1/2 a cup of fruit juice and 2 tablespoons of gelatin and 2 tablespoons of sugar mix all the ingredients into a small saucepan and mix until the gelatin and sugar dissolve completely if any foam forms while stirring skip it off and discard make sure you don't use any fresh juice of tropical fruits like papaya Kiwi or mangoes as they contain an enzyme that will eat the gelatin when it's finished pour it into molds the same as before let it sit for a few hours or you can refrigerate it to make it go a little bit faster method number 3 the sour is power method citric acid is the key apparently this stuff is really sour add one package of jell-o and 10 grams of gelatin to a small pot put in as much citric acid as you want a quarter teaspoon is going to make it sound but go ahead and put in as much as you want in our case a lot add in a third of a cup of cold water and stir then let it bloom for five minutes heat it on medium heat until done pour them into the mold as needed visit number for an easy microwave candy method allow the gelatin to bloom for five minutes in half a cup of cold water add another quarter cup of water and put in the microwave for one minute then mix in the jello and stir until clear put it in the molds and refrigerate for two hours method number five the it's complicated but you can eat it faster method this one is similar to the first one but there are a few more steps we'll need our sugar and gelatin and some sort of flavored liquid we're using Powerade we're also going to need corn syrup and sip your cat's yep there it is combine the sugar gelatin and Powerade in a heatproof container and let it bloom for about five minutes when it's finished stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds then stir gently microwave it again for 15 seconds and then stir if the mixture is not melted continue in 5 second increments until it is add in the corn syrup and citric acid and stir gently let it sit for 10 minutes and then skim the top boom off pour it directly into a mold of whatever size you want then put it in the refrigerator and chill it for 1 hour and then the gummies are ready to eat while we let these set we'll go ahead and explain to you exactly what gelatin is because like most things that you don't understand the basis is swine well most gelatin is produced from pig skin which contains about 30 percent collagen by weight collagen is the connective tissue protein that gives strength to muscles and tendons and resiliency to an animal skin and bones to make gelatin pig skin is soaked in dilute acid for about 24 hours which unravels Lacrosse linking protein bonds in the collagen the resulting free chains are extracted filtered purified and drained into granules powder that are around 90% gelatin eight percent water and 2% salts and glucose when the gelatin blooms it is soaking up the cold water it has to be cold at this point because hot water completely destroys the gelatin ability to set heat causes them to initially unravel and disperse just like any protein they never form new bonds though so the liquid in which they're dispersed stays fluid because gelatin proteins are long stream they tend to become interwoven causing the hot liquid in which they're suspended to thicken but not completely solidified when warm as gelatin cools as inner gummy candies here the protein strands line up next to each other and twist into long ropes transforming the liquid into a firm gel it takes at least another four hours to let these sets so we'll be back the corn syrup is amazing I hate it when no one gets my puns hey so we have allowed these to dry for seven days the longer you let them dry just open air than the chewier they're gonna get so hopefully a little bit more like the store-bought ones these we might have left them a little bit too long they might be a little bit too chewy but that's fine okay first up is the first one we tried which is the one that the king of random made first yeah let's try it hmm so they're chewy like flavor on them though yeah we did use these cooking oil to spray that molds with and it seems like the cooking oil has mostly disappeared that's pretty good they definitely are chewier than doorbot gummies method number two the something-something fruit method yeah I don't have high hopes first reaction imagine saran wrap and wuzzle-buck into a ball with no flavor I'm getting that strong cooking a little flavor okay is easy not so good ilianna just throughout her there goes two for candy there so probably don't make that method unless you're one of those healthy people okay method number three the sour is power we put a lot of citric acid into this so let's see what they taste like mmm much more like mmm that's pretty good white sour mmm but good flavor and they're not super rubbery which is okay so then the fourth method this is the one that took the least amount of time to actually make so they're definitely rubbery oh no not a whole lot of flavor there but definitely better than garbage so that brings us to our last which is takes a little bit more work but can eat them faster method so they're chewy but you can actually bite through which is great let's rank these from the best to the worst thanks for watching we have new content coming out every single week so stay tuned if you like what you saw find that like button down below and stay tuned because bloopers are coming up fish feed ones hey what's the difference between a fish and a guitar you can't tuna fish what's the difference between the octopus and a guitar when made of wood [Music] Wow cake and we have I've been told in no uncertain terms that I am not allowed to make anyone come candies what's alone so what we have here is we have some fish shapes [Music] yeah we have some bear shapes which I can't eat yet because they're not [Music] [Laughter]", "9dadHGeDI7o": "[Music] [Applause] hi guys um we're here having a little vacation and i wanted to share with you a little hack that i have um as you can hear in the background i have my twins and they're always full of energy and um a lot of play time and screaming and whatnot sometimes that could be a little stressful so um i carry these guys with me everywhere i go and i just pop one or two and then it relaxes me relaxes me but it doesn't impair me um i can still take care of my kids and do all the things i need to do so um hey someone when everybody's having a great vacation what are you doing these days [Applause] [Music] you", "oOQlSEMnQs4": "hey Ron today I'm gonna show you guys recipe that I use from vegan gummy bears or any governor lolly as I guess these are great because they are really simple to thank and they avoid gelatin which is obviously ground-up animal hooves they avoid artificial colorings such are quite high quantities and a lot of volleys and they avoid excessive sugars and preservatives as well so they're really awesome thing to be able to do and you can personalize them I would recommend having a mould that has more than one more than one slot I only had an individual coming to be involved which was quite tedious but you can also just pull the mixture into a tray and louts it and then chop them up into little kind of cube lollies as well so I'm using a few different flavorings here which I'll show you guys the basic principle that I'm using is one cup of liquid to four tablespoons of agar agar powder so firstly I'm making a vanilla almond milk flavor and for that I'm using half a cup of almond milk two tablespoons of a baby powder one inch of vanilla pods beans and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia-sweetened and I'm just putting into a pot my half a cup of almond milk and then I'm adding into there my two tablespoons of a bag and just mixing it through thoroughly and I'm squeezing out my inch of Anila pods beans and putting them on the neck I'm adding in two tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten now mixing that up and putting it over low heat and allowing it to come to a seminar it will simmer for a couple of minutes and then it will start to thicken up nicely so once it's thickened up I'm taking my mold and I'm pouring a small amount in there and you can just put it in the freezer for 30 seconds or less and all sit really quickly and then you can pop out your first gummy beer or first tray of gummy bears hopefully and you can store them in the fridge next I'm going on to make the strawberry flavor that I'm using a quarter of a cup of strawberries a quarter of a cup of water two tablespoons of agar agar and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia like before sauce the same process I'm measuring up the berries with the water and you can strain them through some cloth and I'm just using a cheesecloth or a nut milk cloth to strain the berries through and then I'm adding my two tablespoons of agar agar powder and mixing them through and adding a small amount of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia just sweeten that and then I'm putting it on to low heat allowing it to bubble to and pouring it into my mold setting it and popping them out so next one that I'm doing for this as blueberries and I'm just using a quarter of a cup of blueberries and a quarter of a cup of water 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and some maple swimming pool stevia again and it's just the same process you could strain the berries or just puree them I'm actually leaving some of the pulp and this time it's quite nice like that and then pouring them into my molds once they've simmered with that guide a powder in here in allowing them to suit you so then I'm making a pineapple flavored one and this is using pineapple juice and it's quite an easy thing to do you could use it with any flavor adjustment also making some orange juice flavored ones as well I'm using half a cup of pineapple juice and add 2 tablespoons of agar agar you can also sweeten it a little bit further as well with some stevia if you wanted to and so I'm just mixing that together and then I am simmering it and pouring it into my molds and once I pop them out I had my little pineapple gummy bears and I also have these orange ones so then you've got some finished gummy bears those are flavors that I really like and they're so simple to do and you can continue playing around with all sorts of different flavors I haven't tried it yet but I'm thinking about doing you know like a coffee and almond milk once we milk and also trying different teas as well I thought my golden mango green tea would be really nice with the stevia in it and it would be really healthy as well so various things like that but just basically store them in the airtight container in the fridge for about a week they do sit perfectly fine at room temperature consistency wise but you know they don't have preservatives so you want to make sure that they're fine if you're going to do try this out I would love to your heart grows for you especially if you've got some awesome combinations and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope people wonderful day guys", "ufr2SU18_WE": "[Music] the cbd gummy bears are ideal for

still have our gummy and eater too if you're on a keto diet so join me today as make my version of keto gummies now these keto gummies are ridiculously simple you just need two ingredients or three if you cut the water so the first one bean and this is the most important one for that gummy consistency is gelatine powder now this is what turns normal jello into a gummy consistency so i've got two cups of warm water so i'm going to add about two tablespoons of our gelatine mixture and we're just going to let that gelatin soak up all that water so just now that's all dissolved i'm just gonna give it a quick stir just to combine and now for the flavor i'm going to use some sugar-free jello now this just makes it far easier but if you don't have sugar-free jello just add some flavoring and say a little bit of stevia for sweetness so into our warm water i'm just going to pour in our sugar-free jello and just give it a good stir until it's completely dissolved okay so lastly i've just got a gummy mould now you can find these in most shops so it obviously makes no difference which one to use and just simply going to pour our mixture into each gummy mold [Music] okay so once you've filled up all your gummy moulds simply place it in the fridge for a good one or two hours to completely set now gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours so it's just a simple matter of removing them from our molds and look at that one delicious keto friendly gummy bear and there we have some delicious keto gummy bears now i've also made gummy worms gummy bottles gummy rings so this is certainly a very versatile recipe you can use any mold that you like any flavor that you like and it's completely healthy no sugar no carbs so whether you're making gummy bears or some delicious

So big thanks to Simple Health\nfor their continued support and for sponsoring this video. Now, today, I'm gonna be making a recipe from The Vulgar Chef and it is for ranch-flavored gummy bears. Ranch-flavored gummy bears. Let that sink in for a minute. Ranch, you know, that white saucy stuff that everyone loves to dip their crudites or\ntheir carrot sticks in. That stuff. I'm talking about that stuff. And I'm talking about gummy bears and making a savory\nversion of gummy bears. Sounds interesting, right? Because I've never had a savory version of a gummy bear ever, and I've always wanted to make gummy bears way, way, way, way, way back, back when homemade\ngummy bears was a thing, I think that's probably about\nsix or seven years ago, now. I remember when the King\nof Random made gummy Legos. And I said, yes. Step back a little bit. Actually, a few years ago, I did make homemade Sour Patch Kids, which is kind of like a gummy, but I've never used a gummy\nbear mold or anything. So, of course I had to get\nmy mitts on a gummy mold and I picked up this one right here. So I was thinking, I might need a little bit of insurance for this particular recipe. 'Cause what if these gummy\nsnacks don't taste good? I mean, I've made plenty of\nthings that don't taste good, but here's another ranch-themed snack that I've always wanted\nto make, but never did. So, we'll just put it all together. We'll make it a two-for-one video today. So, let me..... The rest -- other.... (tape rewinding) The other recipe I wanna\nmake comes out of this book. It's from the Backs.... \"Back of the Box Gourmet\". I've made other recipes from this, but these are all recipes\nthat are on the back of boxes of famous things, like mock apple pie, which I've made by the way, I will put the link down below. What other things? No-bake chocolate cheesecake, which was on the back of the Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips. Lipton onion burger sandwich on the back of the Lipton soup thingies. This is the Hidden Valley\nRanch oyster crackers. So while my gummy bears are setting up, I'm gonna make a batch of crackers too, because I think those are\ngonna be stinking delicious. So if these don't turn out,\nat least I'll have crackers. Okay, let's make the gummy snacks first. So the first thing we need\nto do is bloom our gelatin. Basically blooming means\nto rehydrate the gelatin. I'm using two packets of Knox\nunflavored plain gelatin. So we're just gonna take one\nthird of a cup of milk -- the Vulgar Chef uses a dry measuring cup, so that's what I'm gonna use -- two packets of gelatin; and sprinkle that right over the top. One, two. Kind of a cool thing happens\nwhen we have gelatin blooming. It kind of gets all\nwrinkly and shriveled up and it looks kind of, brain-like. Kind of like the surface of\nlike brain coral or something. It's kind of great. So this is gonna take about five minutes. So I'm gonna let it to do its thing and I'll be right back. So out of convenience, I'm using my little\nItaki Shabuki pot here. You could definitely use a sauce pan and do this right over\nthe stove, easy peasy. Or even in a microwave safe\ndish and just nuke this. Alrighty. So while we're waiting for the\ngelatin to bloom in the milk, why don't we prep our crackers? You're going to need\na bag oyster crackers. Now these are just like\nsaltines or a plain cracker seasoned with a bit of\nsalt and they're delicious. And, actually, I think, pretty\nessential to clam chowder. So you can find them\neverywhere here in New England, not surprisingly. So we're gonna need one\nbag of oyster crackers. The recipe calls for a 12 or 16 ounce bag. I have a nine ounce bag. So I'm gonna scale back the\nrecipe just a little bit. I have noticed just the other\nday we bought graham crackers for S'mores and my crackers\nwere significantly smaller. Have you noticed this? I'm not a huge graham cracker eater, but I noticed that when I\nsnapped the crackers in half, they didn't make squares,\nthey were rectangles. I remember taking graham crackers -- if you follow me on Instagram, you know I already talked about this in my story. I apologize for being redundant, but I really feel like\nthis needs to be shared. So the box looks the same\nin terms of packaging size, but when you open it, there is a gap between\nthe stack of crackers and the side walls of the box. So the crackers are significantly smaller. And my theory is that they\nkeep the prices the same, but you're getting fewer,\nless amount of cracker. I don't know. I've also noticed this on\nAnimal Crackers as well. They're smaller. I know that I've grown since I was, you know, five, when I was\neating animal crackers, but they're definitely\nsmaller than they used to be. Okay. So I think that's what's happening here with the oyster crackers. This book was written several years ago, back when oyster crackers\nwere in 12 or 16 ounce bags rather than nine ounce. Okay, enough of that. Dump 'em in. Two thirds of a cup of oil. Okay. Oil. We're gonna add one package of Hidden Valley Ranch\nseasoning, dump that in. Did you know the third\ningredient listed on Hidden Valley Ranch is monosodium\nglutamate known as MSG, which makes everything\ntaste more delicious? The more, you know. Deliciousness. That's why it's so\ndelicious, I'm telling you. MSG. I am not a huge consumer\nof ranch dressing, but when it's around, I like it. Quarter teaspoon, lemon pepper. Dill. Always reminds me of pickles. Dill. Half teaspoon of dill weed. I like how they call it dill weed. Boomp. Garlic powder. Boom, boom. Gonna mix-y mix-y that all up. Now, we're gonna pour\nall this deliciousness right on top of these. Oh boy. Get all of that in there. Now we're gonna toss to coat. This is like a bath. It's actually kind of\npooling at the bottom here. Okay, I'm going to have one straight up 'cause I can't handle this. Oh yeah. They're gonna be good. Yum yum, yeah. Hey, come back here. Okay. Get all of that in there. You will not escape. Now it says to bake these in a warm oven. Which I guess it's probably\nless than 200 degrees? 200 degrees? Guess whatever is the lowest\ntemperature on your oven. I'm gonna be using my\nhandy dandy toaster oven. Put them in a single layer. (crackers tapping) Spread that around. Now, place these in a warm\noven for 15 to 20 minutes. \u266a Do do, do do \u266a Our gelatin is pretty much all firmed up. There's still some dry gelatin on top. I'm gonna use this and\nkind of stir this up to get all that gelatin\nin contact with the water. I'm gonna close my window now because there's a neighbor vacuuming and it's kind of annoying. Can't go that way. Oh, I'm smellin' crackers. (whistles) Check on your crackers\n'cause they're gonna toast like lickety-splitness. Whenever you smell anything\ntoastin' it's probably toastin'. So, those look amazing. So I went ahead and\nturned off my toaster oven because it was getting\na little bit too frisky. Now we're going to make the gummy bears. Heat this up. Oop, see, it's already beginning to melt. And we want to heat this fully, so that all the gelatin melts entirely. It's happening quickly. Nice. Let me go in with my silicone scraper. Try to work out any lumpage here. Technical term, lumpage. Now we're going to add one\npacket of ranch dressing. Okay. That's looking a lot like ranch. Use some vegetable oil\nand give it a little bit of oil in here. My little gummy maker\ncame with this eyedropper. I'm gonna use that to\nsuck some of this up. Nice. Eyedropper of ranch gelatin. So we get some bears in there. Don't forget the lions. Let's get some monkeys too. Let's make some penguins too. Boo boo, boo boo boop. And let us not forget the gummy worm. So one batch of that\nmixture is enough to make one tray of gummies. I'm going to place this\nin the refrigerator. So let's snack on our\nwarm crackers, shall we? Look, those look beautiful. Hidden Valley Ranch oyster crackers. Itadakimasu! Pretty tasty. Mhmm. They could be a ranchy-er though. Honestly. The addition of the oil\nmakes them extra crispy. They're kind of light and airy and fluffy without tasting greasy or feeling greasy. So the recipe measurements include kind of a range of measurements. So I erred on the side\nof the lesser amounts because my bag of crackers was smaller. I would say if you make this, go full on and do the large amounts, even for the nine ounce bag of crackers. 'Cause I think these could\nuse even more seasoning. They're pretty good. In fact, I'm going to add some\nleftover ranchy powder and put that right on top. Now we have a more intense\nbuttermilk ranch flavor to them. (cracker crunching) Mm-hm. And it kind of coats your fingers, so you get that kind of\nCheeto, Dorito, experience 'cause you know, you\nget the powdery stuff. Yeah. That's what you do, people. Okay, delicious. How many have I eaten now? Like 20? Okay, girl needs to stop. It has been over an hour now since I put the gummies\nin the refrigerator and they should now be set. Let's go grab 'em. (Emmy vocalizes) Oh yes. Oh yes. Look at this. Silicone molds, man. I'm just gonna push them out. Boom. So easy and so satisfying\nand look at the detail. Oh, you gotta see this. Boom. Boom. Boom. And look how detailed. Oh my gosh. The monkeys are so cute. Boop. Yep, penguin's cute. Oh yeah, look at the gummy worm. (Emmy imitates spring boinging) Ranch-flavored homemade gummies. Itadakimasu! Mm. Wow. Those are strong. They have kind of a different\ntexture than gummies, though. They're bouncy. And I don't taste any\nof the gelatin, though. That's a bit of an aside, but, they are full of ranch flavor. They're actually very intensely\nflavored, pretty salty. Nice kind of buttermilk tang to them. The texture is a little bit different than a regular gummy bear too. They're not quite as soft. They're bouncy and chewy, but they don't have that\nkind of slightly tenderness and like, elasticity. I think that's what's really missing. There's not kind of a stretch. There's a bounce like\na rubber band bounce, but there's not this kind of nice little bouncy stretch to them. It's more just like ning, ning, ning, ning rather than that, heh. I've read in another recipe that sorbitol is what they put in regular\ngummy bears to give them that chewy softness. I think that's probably what these need. So final thoughts, are these good? They're fine. If you are a total ranch\nnut, you will love these, because they just taste\nlike ranch dressing. But they're in the shape\nof, of gummy animals. I think it's something\nabout that combination of gummy texture and that\nchallenge to your expectations of what gummies should be that makes this kind of\nan unpleasant experience. It's not disgusting. It's just terribly unexpected. Alrighty. So they have it. Ranch-flavored gummies and\nranch-flavored oyster crackers. Thanks so much for joining me.

They're so tasty, look amazing and are perfect\u00a0for this holiday season.  So, let's bake!  This cookie\u00a0\u00a0dough is super simple.  All you need to do is mix\u00a0240 g of butter with 150 g of sugar and\u00a05 g of salt.  I add my salt with the butter and\u00a0sugar. I think it gives the cookie the right balance\u00a0of sweetness. \u00a0Mix until creamy and a lighter colour.\u00a0 Over medium to high speed.   Add one beaten egg,  and one tsp of vanilla paste or extract.\u00a0\u00a0 Mix until well combined.  Add 440 g of\u00a0flour and mix over low speed until combined.\u00a0 Don't over mix it, this part needs to be\u00a0\nreally gentle so you don't get hard cookies. Press the dough over your table or cooking station,\u00a0making it flat, and cover it with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bring the dough from the fridge and, between two pieces of parchment paper,\u00a0\u00a0 roll the dough until it's\u00a0about a half a cm thick.\u00a0\u00a0 Cut using cookie cutters.  I'm using\u00a0a star shape, Christmas Tree and a circle. You need to use the cutters\u00a0where you also have the exact\u00a0shapes but smaller,  so you\u00a0can cut out to the middle. If the dough gets too soft, put it in the fridge to firm before removing the smaller cutter. Roll out the remaining dough again. Put all cookies into the freezer for\u00a0\nabout 10 to 20 minutes until they get\u00a0\u00a0 really hard and pre-heat your oven. For the\u00a0gummy bear candies, I like to use the sour ones, Which gives the cookies a nice tartness\u00a0\nthat balances well with the sweetness.\u00a0\u00a0 Pick the colours of gummy bears you want. I'm using some holiday colours. Cutting them will help them melt and spread\u00a0better. This will also help you fill all your edges. Take the dough from the freezer\u00a0and separate your cookies. Roll all the remaining dough again.  Bake the\u00a0cookies for about seven minutes until you see\u00a0the bottoms start to get lightly golden. Add the gummy bears in the centre of the cookies.  Add the thinner pieces at the\u00a0edges so they spread it evenly. Put them back in the oven and bake them for\u00a0another 5 minutes, until the bears are all melted. And the cookies are lightly golden on the top. You can also use a wooden stick to spread them and mix up the colours more if you want. You can check while they're baking\u00a0if the centres are too shallow,\u00a0\u00a0 and can add more gummies, it depends on\u00a0the way you shape them, so be aware. After the cookies are ready let them\u00a0\ncool completely before moving them. When the cookies are cool, they will remove\u00a0easily leaving you with a perfect cookie. These holiday gummy bear cookies\u00a0are perfect for any occasion, and bring amazing colour and flavours to your\u00a0table.  Fresh, tasty and an unexpected sour punch. Anyone who is lucky enough to try one, will just love them.  I hope you loved this recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 For more amazing recipes and food adventures, don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel.

I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long do you think he'll take you to eat is

hanging out with my sister well everybody I am so excited because today's video is super special it is a first for us we are celebrating and making a recipe for Mother's Day and it's special because this is gonna be the first Mother's Day that's not just for our mom anymore yeah this is Molly's first Mother's Day as a mom herself I got something so here I know why do you think of your sister and know your mama oh mama look at my mama over here you're an auntie this is this is so crazy I know I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like seeing a smile and cuddling with him and just seeing him name seeing him grow every day and learn new things it's it's the coolest thing he's so cute he's so cute how does mom life is it like like like tell me about it well you don't sleep you really don't okay it's been an adjustment but you just you get used to it learn how to function on a lot less sleep yeah that's right that's what you're doing and that's why you deserve a delicious Mother's Day treat that's right so this Mother's Day if you're not making her one of these do something nice for Mom she'll call your mom say thank you yeah cuz now mo knows how much work it is to raise a little baby and it's a lot of work okay baby Grayson is taking a nap right now but can we see him when he wakes up yes all right the tray is full mm-hmm and it is ready to chill we're gonna pop this in the refrigerator for two hours to set and then they are ready to serve also this recipe makes about five dozen gummy bears mm-hmm so depending on your tray size you might want to make a couple trays so she'd probably you press it in here I should really I'm gonna go put these in the refrigerator and then let's go see hi baby Grayson like okay baby hey there's my nephew hello he's getting so big lady-y-y he was a new boy he was like this big you know he's this vignette he's about seven pounds now he's 12 welcome to the kitchen baby gray this is where we do all the baking it's where your very first birthday cake will be made right here oh my god it's Liberty boy little treats and today Moon's making a lottery for herself today oh my gosh mo can I hold him yeah okay what do I need to do okay you might forget let me get the burp rag this is how you hold a baby nephew okay I'm totally ready okay man step to jepty grab and put him against ya what if he wants to day in he can dance like a human you using Itt are you so baby speaks losing your beep beep beep yeah hey butI in Japan these movie in the pants he like are there he's definitely our family handsome such a big boy oh my God he's such a big boy why are you the cutest man there we go there's the spark so baby needs a beat thank state booty in the paints that's your new hit single dance the booty in the pants yeah because you're here because you feel okay you're gonna go hang out with Uncle Mike now and we're gonna finish making some gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she loved it yes she would let me oh right cue the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tada here are the homemade wine gummy bears that we made today we have our rose a blue are red and our white yep and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a white grape juice you can do whatever you'd like you just evenly replace the ingredient again I'll be putting the recipe down below and we'll be taking lots of pictures and posting these all over social medias if you make these gummy bears please take a picture and send it to us oh my god we loves you your baking creations

the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you enjoyed this video what you think if you've had any problems or if you try it after watching this let me know how that worked out for you but I want to thank you very much for tuning in here today sorry for the cheese but if you haven't hit that subscribe button please do and we will make it worth

"[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you",

non-alcoholic just leave out the half a cup of Rose day and in a quarter cup of cranberry juice with a quarter cup of sparkling club soda so you still get that sparkling gummy bear flavor then just stir this all together and let it sit for a minute so the gels and has a chance to start to bloom then over lo he's just staring a quarter cup of white sugar and if you want you're gonna have a drop of pink food coloring to give it that rosy color then you're just gonna stir the mixture until the gelatin and the sugar are dissolved for the tricks of making these so they stay nice and sweet and boozy is low and slow on the stovetop don't let it get over ninety degrees Fahrenheit so you still get that really intense rosacea champagne flavor shining through and that was basically it now we're gonna turn off the heat but we're gonna leave it on the burner to keep the jealous and warm while we fill up our gummy bear molds so I'm just using a little dropper that came with the mold sweep and also just pour the mixture right on top and use a spatula to kind of wipe away any excess so I got this gummy bear mold online I'll leave a link for you guys so you can get one too but you can definitely just pour the mixture into a regular 8 by 8 inch pan and just line it with plastic wrap that way once it's all firm just pull it out you can slice it up into a little square gumming it so you don't even need the mold at all and they come out totally perfect you got you can kind of already smell the rose day we're just gonna pop these in the fridge to firm up for a few hours or you can just pop them in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes until they're nice and firm and then we can pop them out and give you a try you guys how insanely fabulous to these turn out oh my gosh I love the little stars these are not so cute then we just let them come to room temperature and they are soft and gummy and ready to serve if you're not gonna serve them right away to put them in an airtight container in the fridge make sure they're covered so they don't dry out and get tough and rubbery then just bring them to room temperature before serving and you are all set for the most fun candy ever I can't decide if I like the clear champagne colored ones or the pink rose they ones better they're so cute I kind of like to mix and match and combine them all for a really fun look alright the best part I cannot wait to taste these little cuties look at this little gummy guy if you guys give these a try be sure to time doing a picture on social media at Lindsey and bakes or if you noticed what I would love these Rosie all day gummy bears be sure to share this video with them alright oh my mom it tastes just like rubbery gym babies are so cool kind of bad bite now this cute little gummy but you like these are insane they literally taste like sparkling rose a in a gummy candy form these are like the total ultimate candy for grownup all your friends are gonna love these I promise these are soft and chewy just like a regular gummy bear but they have that Rose a sparkling flavor to them and those pretty gold stars just make them extra magical like how could you not smile

this week's YouTube video Rosie gummy bears with real rose a in them yes way Rosie all day your friends are gonna flip over these they're pretty epic [Music]", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "-xix6u2w-uc": "guys do i look like wendy from peter pan right now this bow is giving me peter pan wendy vibes i always wanted to be wendy hi everybody welcome back to my channel if you are new welcome my name is cooper new and today we're making another fun little treat in the kitchen we're making champagne gummy bears let's go i'm so excited i'm gonna set these down i made gummy bears once before on my channel it was weird anyway all of my friends and family know my two favorite things on earth are gummy bears and champagne that's it that's all i need so let's combine them there's a candy brand called sugarfina they have champagne gummy bears they're amazing so i'm going to try to make it myself so yeah if you want to see how to make champagne gummy bears it's supposed to be super easy then just keep watching [Music] so for this you actually don't need very many things you just need champagne you need sugar and you need gelatin oh and also gummy bear molds hello duh for right now i have one cup of the root rose is reducing over medium heat once this has kind of reduced down a little bit we'll add another cup and a half and now i'm going to do just a regular champagne i figured it would be fun to try both again i'm absolutely terrified of doing this part oh my god am i doing it i'm doing it oh wow i'm a beast nice i took off the last one with a cork opener i know that's super not how you're supposed to do that but i did it so one cup yes i feel like i should pour myself a glass while i'm making this what do you guys think it is time for some champagne i love to drink champagne everything's looking good these guys are bubbling i'm enjoying my day how's everyone doing are we all doing well okay so let me tell you guys a little bit about the gelatin we're using today agar agar what i'll name my firstborn it is a vegetable gelatin substitute the difference here this is plant-based it's made from red algae without any artificial chemical ingredient regular gelatin is made from skin bones tendons and cartilage of livestock animals yuck that's kind of gross this has fibers calcium iron vitamins so yeah this should be interesting i'm excited to try this this one looks like it's reduced so i'm going to go ahead and add a cup and a half more so the rose one is doing a nice job here so we are going to go ahead and add the gelatin and also the sugar so for the gelatin you're doing one fourth of a cup okay and now let's also add while that's doing that let's add a cup of sugar there we go so we are going to continue to whisk this until everything dissolves and until it really thickens up so now i'm going to do the exact same thing over here for our regular champagne gummies fourth a cup of the gelatin pour that in got it all over me and also a cup of sugar now i'm just gonna go back and forth kind of whisking these guys until they look ready to me i guess take our lovely reduced mixture here this is the rose one and i have out our gummy bear molds and i'm going to use a dropper now this might take an eternity uh to do a dropper and do this but i'm willing okay so let's begin so what's interesting about agar agar is that am i saying that right agar agar whatever is that the freezing point of it you know when the molds get hard is just room temperature so these are already ready to go so that's pretty cool that you can make these so fast i'm telling you these are already ready oops look he's already ready to eat i'm going to eat him interesting but delicious i'm gonna keep making some more i'll be back okay guys here they are uh these are the champagne ones these are the rose ones aren't they kind of cool nice so i just want to show you what they look like if you decide you want to coat them in sugar it gives them obviously a little extra sweetness but they're still just as cute look at that guy these also have a little bit more of a melt in your mouth kind of more of a jello texture than a traditional gummy bear these turned out really well i'm actually really impressed with how quickly the agar agar solidifies just at room temperature it's super fast and yeah these are really good it says that these are best kept in the refrigerator i like the regular champagne ones a lot more than rose ones i wonder if i could toss them and eat them in the sky i'll get it oh close that was way off i don't know what that was nope nope that was just straight up and down that was way behind my head nice i did it that is it for this video thank you so much for watching and i will go ahead and see you guys again in my next one bye", "1Y7hrWj9sY0": "hey everyone its James from fun foods and today I'm just going to make these Mountain Dew gummy bears now this was a request video and they turned out amazing so keep watching I'll show you step by step how to make these now the first thing we need to do in a medium pot we need to add two cups of Mountain Dew soda to it then just bring this over to the stove until it starts to boil while we're waiting for our mountain dew to start boiling get out a large pot and to that we want to add one more cup of Mountain Dew soda and then I have three of these packets of unflavored gelatin just take it out and sprinkle it on top of your Mountain Dew you don't have to mix it just sprinkle it all in there now just let that do its magic while we're waiting on our other mountain Dew to boil alright so when your Mountain Dew starts to boil we'll just turn off the heat and take it over to our work station now just pour your boiling Mountain Dew into your Mountain Dew that we poured the unflavored gelatin on and mix it in you want to mix it for about five minutes until all that unflavored gelatin has dissolved and at this stage now that all our gelatin has dissolved what I'm going to do is divide this I'm going to keep some of them this color this regular Mountain Dew yellow color and some of them I'm gonna turn green so I just want to pour some in another bowl not a lot and add a little green food coloring to it mix that up now just let these sit out for a little bit before we put them in our molds because I'm using plastic molds I don't want the heat the hot liquid to melt my plastic molds so you have to be really careful if you're using silicone molds you can put them in there right away that's fine but plastic molds be careful don't let them be too hot or they'll melt your molds now I'm going to transfer my liquid into something with a pour spout just to make it easier for me to pour them into our molds so they don't go all over the place so the little one here I'm going for the green in big one I'll pour the yellow all right so now I have my mold here and I just have this one template of little bears it's only six of them so I have this little silicone silicone mold it looks like bananas or something just use up the stuff the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill about half these bears with the green and then half with the yellow now hopefully I'll have just a steady hand when I'm doing the yellow we'll see and then just fill your other molds up whichever way you'd like now just take these put these in a refrigerator for a couple hours just until they set well my Mountain Dew gummy bears have been in the refrigerator setting up for about three hours I'm a bit nervous and I don't know if I used enough gelatin they are firm but not as firm as I want them to be so we're gonna try to get them out of here see if we get them out intact and that's always a challenge especially when you don't have a silicone mold so let's try this I'm gonna try with a knife gently to remove this and decapitate it the first one that's not good poor bear taste food anyway don't think it's gonna work out my friends we got to do Plan B we got to make them with more gelatin so since it didn't work out on our last attempt we're gonna try things a little different this time we're still going to start out with the saucepan and we're gonna add 2 cups of Mountain Dew soda to that bring this over to the stove and bring it to a boil while that's over on the stove boiling we have one cup of Mountain Dew in a large bowl this time I'm gonna use five of these packets of this Knox unflavored gelatin and I think that was part of the problem not all the problem but part of it I want to make it a little firmer than it was it was almost just like a jello and not like a gummy so we're gonna add five packets of this and you just sprinkle this in on top of your Mountain Dew [Music] and this time what I'm doing differently is preparing our molds a little bit different last time they didn't come out too well and of course if you have silicone molds use that because there's a lot easier but what I'm gonna do this time is I'm gonna spray this with some cooking spray gently just a little bit and then because I'm extra nervous about this is I'm going to let's wipe a little bit of the excess off it so it's a bit much not dry but just no puddles of spray now we want to take some powdered sugar or icing sugar and we just want to lightly coat this I'm just really going the extra step to make sure it doesn't stick in there now we can just fill our molds I'm gonna do three of them green three um yellow and hopefully they work out this time all right so I have pulled my gummy bears out of the refrigerator they've been in there about three and a half hours and now it's show time to see if they come out of this mold all intact I got my fingers crossed I hope it happens if not we'll have to redo this with some silicone molds so let's see how we did I'll start with the yellow one I'm just gonna kind of pull it away from the sides a little bit of my fingers before I try to pull it out hopefully that will work and see if I can kind of like push it and peel it out looks like it might work oh yes I did it so one of the other ones have come out nicely perfect well now something to taste us I'm gonna try one of the yellow gummy bears the yellow Mountain Dew gummy bears and see how taste tastes like Mountain Dew now I'm do gummy bear it's pretty good and this is the one I didn't put any food coloring in it it was just straight and Mountain Dew so really good well thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching me make these Mountain Dew gummy bears is a lot of fun

in this yummy blueberry flavor do you remember put your answer below in the comments bye cookies woo", "CYHTDnsuZGY": "ready for a fun simple treat for you and the family let's get started today we're going to be making one of my favorites gummy bears but wait we can't have gummy bears on keto correct not so fast today we're going to make something that is super simple and it really only requires three simple ingredients all right so the ingredients we're going to need real simple today i went down to walmart and picked up four of the sugar-free flavors of jell-o it's really all you need when we make this recipe keep in mind i'll put the macros at the end but 20 calories absolutely zero carbs three proteins per and that's going to give you about 25 gummy bears per serving you can get the molds and amazon i also picked up an additional mold for the gummy worms those are just a little bit extra fun so all right to get started we're going to go with a quarter cup of water in the pot we're going to bring it to a slow boil now one of the things i told you is that this is super simple we're going to go with two simple ingredients i'm going to start off with a little bit of the sugar-free orange and just pick you up a packet of unflavored gelatin that's really about all you need bring it down a little bit so we don't we don't burn it out but that's really all you need i'm going to bring this in and let's get started start by putting in our one packet of our gelatin and then we'll put in our one packet of orange stir this in and you're going to want to go until everything is fully dissolved okay now that we've got our jello completely melted we're simply going to take an eye dropper that we we got with our molds and we're going to start filling the molds it's that simple [Music] okay so as you can see the one box gave us about 35 gummy bears and gave us an additional three of the gummy worms now keep in mind we said a little bit earlier and we'll put the macros out uh shortly after this but for all that we just made for the 35 or so gummy bears and the and the worms you're talking uh pretty much zero carbs on any of this stuff it's a great fantastic substitute for when you have that sweet tooth or for when you're just wanting to have something a little bit different like a gummy bear we're gonna go ahead and fill up the rest of these and once we're done i'll be right back [Music] as you can see we're starting to wrap up what we have um and we've made quite the load of uh quite a load of gummy bears um this is going to be an actually a fantastic treat to have but i'll tell you what so we talked a little bit about um what we can do for these and how we can snack now it's time for the real talk okay guys so we've finished our first recipe we've got some good gummy bears now the part that we're going to talk about here is going to be the real talk about keto so you're going to see a ton of recipes and a lot of them are going to sit there and say that they taste just like the real thing i don't want to break your heart they don't taste like the real thing and so many of you noticed it's just gelatin and jell-o sugar-free jell-o and so many people want to look at that and say well what you basically made is you've made jell-o shots or jell-o bears or jell-o gummy bears or whatever you want to call it just sugar-free and you're not wrong and so this kind of goes into the keto mindset about how you've got to look at your food a lot of the things you'll see on the keto diet are going to be very similar to some of the foods that you eat but not exactly the same and the reason being is that we don't use a lot of the same ingredients that are in a lot of the foods and i give a really good example what we make today has literally zero carbs you can eat these things until your heart's content you're talking about 20 calories per serving of about 25 that's an entire handful and by comparison i'm going to show you something that i think is very interesting [Music] that right there when i went to go pick up our gelatin and the jell-o sugar-free jell-o at the store today i ran across as i was getting some himalayan salt which is another great keto staple there was a a little container of sugar-free gummy bears and it was kind of unique because that's what we were making today now as part of that one of the things that we had seen was that a single serving um 200 i'm sorry a single serving is 47 carbs 47. and out of that 170 calories and 5 protein but 47 carbs if you're really starting to look at it and this is where the the uh the product type and the serving size start to come into play this container was literally maybe a little bit bigger than a tuna can for some comparison and it said that in that container there was nine servings so i can tell you that before i started keto i could eat the entire container not a problem it's not that much it was probably three handfuls of gummy bears now what they did say on the label was a serving size was eight gummy bears so for eight gummy bears you've got 47 carbs 5 protein and 170 calories and so i look at that and i go okay so what am i really getting in real life food and so what you're really looking at is if you break it down you are getting about 211 carbs 765 calories and 22 protein that's what you're going to get if you eat just half of it and that's really kind of typical of the standard american diet and so when we start looking at things for keto and you start looking at how you revise the way you think about food the jello gummy bears make perfect sense you can have them they taste pretty similar to gummy bears your taste buds are going to change and they're going to acclimate to some different things but you're going to be able to go in and actually have something that you can take to the movie theaters when they open again um you're going to be able to take them outside you're going to be able to give them to your kids for snacks they are sugar-free and they're just a great alternative for when you really want something for the sweet tooth so really look at the gummy bears as something that is an alternative to what you used to eat and that's what's really important about this recipe it's not that it's a simple two ingredient recipe where you're using a little bit of water some gelatin and some jello and that's not what it's really about what it's really about is revising the way we think and revising the way we eat and how we view how we view food and so if i can have an option of having 50 i'm talking a big old bowl of gummy bears that taste like it and i hit and run the refrigerator sometimes i'll grab a handful of these things out of a ziploc bag or container and i know that i'm only getting 20 calories and zero carbs it's perfect i hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy the real talk it's the honest talk i'm still fairly new at keto we've been doing it now for about five six months and so we're learning every day and i hope you continue to stick with us and i hope you do the journey with us take care", "DV8aR-CUAIY": "[Music] welcome to crafty girl today we are making DIY edible swine with gummy bears we had over for a request for edible time and we've had almost 60 requests so I slide without grill we've covered all your comments with one slime it's edible

definitely prefer edible slamming sound flu farm you nod to the video remember to hate that subscribe button and click the thumbs up now on to the video for this crap you will need gummy bears powdered sugar and cornstarch you also need a microwave let's get started this is probably the easiest craft we've ever done all you're going to do is specifically mix into a bowl [Music] Oh any now

really hot for you propagate oh ha they're perfect how did you go up thank you thank you hop up here and help uses and number two gummy bears melt really fast to only use them for a few seconds at a time ten seconds in that in this bowl we have a mixture of cornstarch and powdered sugar we've tried this with just corn starch and it works great it's just a little bit sweet if you have the powdered sugar but do not you straight powdered sugar it really does not work and it tastes really sticky we just don't want to mix the red on the green cuz we figured I'll be ugly and off to the microwave come on [Music] ten more seconds in the microwave I'm going to get this about six more seconds [Music] so it took 25 seconds for mine - no I just added my powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture now Lisa altogether inhaler is not too sticky to touch add more powdered sugar and cornstarch as needed over some of your cornstarch make sure on your fingers and then you can start working it with there

these little guys are super easy to make are perfect for kick toppers and tastes just like rose a rose a all-day y'all okay so the first thing we're to do is add our wine to a large measuring cup we're gonna need one and a half cups wherever however much you have in your bottles then we're gonna add in our sugar be aware that you're lying me pizza when you have this layer sugar is honestly totally optional it just makes the wine gummies a little bit sweeter all right so now we're gonna add in four packs of gelatin and you just want to sprinkle that over the surface and try not to like just dump it all in otherwise it's gonna make clothes so I'll just like push down and then add some more and this is called blooming and what it does is its allowing the gelatin to absorb liquid so if you needed more more gummies than just this you could just multiply this batch one and a half cups a liquid beer wine juice whatever you need and then we're gonna let this bloom for five minutes okay it's been five minutes now I'm gonna go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then 15 second increments until all of the gelatin is all melted and there's no granules go inevitably there's going to be some foam on the top you just scoop that off with a spoon if you don't scoop it off it will stay in your gummies so depending on if you want foam works great for beer gummies not so great for wine gummies and then we're gonna add in our corn syrup this is what makes the gummies gummy just mixing until dissolved if you don't want to use corn syrup you can totally use honey just keep in mind that honey is going to give it a honey flavor so it'd be like honey wine honey rose a I mean that kind of sounds amazing so Rose a-after do you add all of the gelatin and stuff it actually ends up being kind of oranjee looking so I have a little bit of water here and I'm going to add a drop of electric pink and the reason I'm putting it in the water first is because the gel does not like to dissolve and alcohol weird I'm just gonna add a couple drops and that just brings like that rose pink color back all right so now we're ready to pour our gummy mixture into the mold I just got these off of Amazon you can use ice mold silicone molds whatever kind of sphere molds you have just kind of squeegeeing the extra jell-o mixture down so I don't have any big gloves you'd be surprised how far one and a half cups of wine will take you can make several types of bowls if you end up with like spilling a ton of this you know like over the edge you can't actually remelt it so once it sets you can just remelt it in the microwave crazy I know all right our dummies have been chilling in the fridge literally look at that so cute yeah look how cute those are so that is how you make ROS a

be anything um definitely ask me down below and I'll make sure to answer it in the Q&A which is going live on Christmas morning or sometime on Christmas so you know let's get started and make the coming bears so first wrinkle the gelatin into the water and let develop for 5 minutes for the champagne into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until philippe salt sprinkle some gold leaf flakes into the inside of a gummy bear mold and gently pour the liquid on top place them all in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully set for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or package them into little cellophane bags for a New Year's Eve gift or you can pop them into some champagne glasses and top with some champagne for a cute sparkly touch to your

slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you.

(laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's.

That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life.

I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay.

Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels.

It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about.

Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess.

It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all?

It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it.

I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot.

I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know.

And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no.

by hand oh well it's a lot faster I'll tell ya yeah this board I mean still not really that fast is it just cuz there's so many yeah they're so like it'll still take you forever to do a whole bag yeah

hurry up dummies thunk OH holy gummy well the gummies Batman so I haven't had gummy bears in many many many years so do each color have different flavors or they all taste the same yeah beacons can't eat bears yeah I think they're actually I think they have like gelatin in them or something oh yeah yeah I don't know jenos Swedish Fish well they're all red so it's probably won't taste red taste right yeah the red tastes a threat to me but the Scandinavian swimmers from Trader Joe's all the different tastes when Max get to it before it plops on the rug taste that was a close driveling

could be like ethan klein thick all right so this is gonna be kelly's second bag ohh dummy bears yes yeah yeah you have any tips and tricks for people doing this Ellen well I don't really think many people are doing this at home hello are you I'm good you need any help let me know yeah because I don't think everybody would have proper equipment yeah we don't have the bags at home which I understand because I'm the new girl hmm so I understand that the orange scale is pretty famous I came over from the old country yeah so it's and it's it's very reliable so we like the orange ghetto and I can't imagine there's a lot of people who have machines to cover gummy bears but if they did if they did yeah then sure they should they could totally do this at home so you just pick them up to put them in the bag and blame on the scale all right pick them up and I put them in the bag and then I weigh them on this case in that order yeah yeah unless I'm really close because if you have all right let's let's add a few more do it okay so and you know I think that dark chocolate is lighter than milk chocolate hmm I think I've noticed that like one pound a one pound of dark chocolate is lighter than 1 pound of milk chef it no but if you're covering stuff I think it weighs different that make sense this is all in my head but that's ok ok so when it see then you got to be like oh we need one more it has to be accurate because nobody wants to get gypped on the chocolate mm-hmm that's not fun No so yeah I I got the dark chocolate ones and I have never tried chocolate-covered joiners gummy bears yeah I had before they weren't my favorite but some people are crazy about them right so what do you do what do you do after have you put them in the bags well after I get them wait because I'm really organized so I am like a system mm-hmm so what I do is I'll get a whole bunch together and then after that is I'm gonna weigh them when they're always on a label so should I come back when they're all waiting yeah and then we can like label them and state bloom and then barcode them and then we can get him on the Shelf that's totally fine sounds like fun what is this part 2 and part 3 part 3 we already know so this is part 3 and so what we do is we take the bag are you gonna get all the air out cuz nobody likes stale candy mm-hmm so get all the air out I'm gonna burping oh we burped the bag burps to being everybody and then we fold it nice and snug and then we have to put a label on mm-hmm see cuz presentation is everything how you determine which bag or which color goes on with bag well decision getting necessarily for color but you want a variety cuz nobody likes boring either yes we need a variety of colors and then we need to make sure that we have the right weight on it because if I put this out and I have the 4 ounce label then that's wrong we don't want to do that because you know it's the whole thing not corpse breathing down your neck that's right I mean like because then I'll get fired and I like just started here so I kind of wanna keep my job labeling is everything yeah you gotta have great label with the right weight and you gotta have it pretty and nice and snug because nobody likes that's a lot of things you're under all ones yeah needless to say I had no idea how much detail goes into being a candy wrapper yeah it's it's a little crazy and I also am just scratching the surface to what I'm going to learn yeah so Karen's teaching you the ways Karen is teaching me and your mom is teaching me so I am learning from the experts gotta get I've got to get it right because you know people are used to consistency too when you change something you don't you don't want them to be like aw I can tell Kelly wrap this in yeah and that would be my luck somebody wrap this wrong it doesn't look right I'll take Karen's handiwork we need to we need to repackage the whole thing alright so I know you're gonna keep doing that but can we show the people what you do next after that well then I got a barcode it okay so and oh yeah I have it right here oh boy so we have the dark chocolate gummy bears and half pound because we're doing a half pound and hey careful where you point that gun this yeah sorry all right where's Bowl see I hey that thing's loaded I haven't done anything today so I'm a pointer sorry no he's also had your thumb up - oh did look kind of like a guy yeah I'm not violent I promise I'm a non-violent individual I'm family candymaker that's right you know cuz candy makes people happy so why would you want to be violent mm-hmm so we're gonna paste I was wrong got a piece the barcode in there and do did you do gotta pick the right label and I gotta count how many bags because we don't want to waste labels or barcodes so I've got four five six seven 12 13 14 yup 14 bags those and we're gonna print out the labels so after all of these get packaged up all nice and pretty where you get the barcode on them and then we're gonna get best by dates that's my date yes it's not like the store see that's why I wasn't sure it is a sticker so we know that when you buy the candy it's fresh cuz you're gonna have fresh candy too so I'm gonna pull all of these I'm one have one perp cuz if I did that see any labels there are there would be no room by you might have Best Buy later so one of these I'll give you an example yeah what can you do that again case I missed it slow motion Wow I think people really got that in there and then we need Best Buy sticker but I don't know how long these last so I look that up too because everything that we have is different depending on what the product is dairy okay this is the only gun we use around here man all right so is that the last thing you do other than put it out there well no then I gotta write it on the handy-dandy clipboard so we know how many we have because then when we have the stuff we can put it online for the people mm-hmm and put on the shelf for the people so the people can come to all of the people and buy the candy and the chocolate-covered gummy bears which are ready yeah oh we're so where'd we put it out on the floor and they all have their little spots Olivia's gonna go here we've got our dark chocolate gummy bears and soon we'll have the four ounce and I think later I might be doing some of the milk chocolate gummy bears so that way we'll have these all back to replenish our stock from Christmas because everybody just loves us and just keeps buying it so yeah you know gotta get it out there for the people so it come to a very unfortunate decision this is gonna be our last shoutout video because there's so many shoutouts that people are requesting and we can't get to all of them so we feel really bad for the people who who asked and then never get it and they might be asking like 10 times but if we never see it we can't you know we can't do that shoutout because I used to answer every single comment and you see every single thing on every social media and then we got way too big I was a good thing I'm glad we're getting somebody comment so they can't get y'all I'm glad I'm glad we have so many people asked for shadows and we can't get to a mile but it's unfortunate for the people who are asking all the time so we're instead of leaving a couple people out or a lot of people out in the cold we're gonna leave everybody out in the cold warmer clime yeah so that's that's our solution to that problem it's gonna make the same thing for live streams just because when we do live streams everybody like almost everything will come and just ask them for a shoutout so if we were to do a live stream it would just basically just be us standing here just giving shoutouts and I think people want to see us making candy so if you do want to shout out if you do a super chat then we give you a shout out but other than that we'll we will just be answering questions and stuff for free so anyway to shout outs I have four four I have three ish okay is the an Alexander from Elizabeth New Jersey mm-hmm Keegan Graham from Lowell Massachusetts Carol and Leonard from Calgary Alberta Canada and Jennifer sinkovitz she didn't actually ask me for a shot up but she sent a note a thank-you note saying thanks for your YouTube channel I'm gonna subscriber I like it so there you go Jennifer and I'm not unasked-for shout out the way I'm ending this thing and I have a couple I have to take off my gloves so it's sanitary yeah I can't be touching ears I mean you can't take them off after using the camera to what you want clean candy-making okay it's just that hammer doesn't care about my camera they just care about the candy okay so Jules almond I think on how you say her name happy birthday to Kailyn Brown whose birthday was on December 5th yeah so we're telling you we're a little behind Angeline merger see from South Africa living in China and so she want me to say so that is all the the shoutouts for Hercules candy hope you enjoyed him yeah cuz it was good while it lasted this is the end my only friend hmm this is the end was that from a song I think the doors song probably yeah I'm sure our people will tell us probably [Music]", "Yh8snA5aqMk": "I'm gonna be obvious you guys like seven-year-old Dan would be super impressed with how much I just spent on candy what's up everybody today I'm back in the kitchen that's are constantly saying one of two things one when are you gonna be back in the kitchen damn and to never go back to the kitchen man yeah I'm a little sick right now that's why I might sound like this so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a bunch of gummy bears melt them down to make a mega gummy bears first off I got a teddy bear mold rented this yeah I didn't know you could read stuff what I'm like hi there can I get the teddy bear mold no like you want to buy it or do you want to rent what you can rent it so I actually am renting this currently for a dollar ninety-nine a day they didn't have the traditional like gummy bear one so I'm going with this guy four different bags of gummy bears we got green we got red we got yellow and we got blue now I want to show you guys something because I know this is gonna come up this will reuse in a day okay you guys are probably thinking I thought it was like a little gummy bear this is the same material as those little gummy bears traditional stereotype gummy bears that you guys are probably thinking of I was originally at knows the ladies like so what are you doing this was like one of the few times is actually honest through the store associate I'm like I'm gonna develop these data like a huge bear Valachi she's the bigger wise girl Lucy he ate a sack same song with these guys plus it was easier to separate the colors that way so let's go over to the stove and let's melt actually before we do that guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and click the bail free for a limited time right now my subscriptions are educating they're always pretty good guys subscribe my channel let's go okay so to my understanding we got to fill up the pot first and then we're gonna put the bowl in like that and that's gonna kind of heat it up this is a bad idea are we not blocking the air from getting now I'm gonna use a bigger pot I think his bigger brother well I forgot to mention you've got no idea what I'm doing go ahead and turn that up to full okay let's let that boil so we're gonna start off with the red ones okay so it looks like what you've successfully melted a bunch of gummy bears suffer that clump we know this melt a little bit more and we're gonna pour the first layer in our mole I know things get stuck way easier than you think so I'm just gonna put some vegetable oil I don't know if the gummies gonna stick yeah like this is gonna help it's pretty much fully melted looks like sweet and sour sauce here we go now we're gonna do is take this put it in the freezer well that's cooling we're actually gonna start melting the other colors alright next we're gonna do blue I want the bottom of you more blue which is why I poured it we will see down there for our third color we got green that's weird already seems to be melting we can't let water get in there I don't know why but this is so satisfying like the Bears aren't fully melted well you just like stab right through them unless not least yellow my favorite flavor I have favorite color do your thing yellow all right that's three layers in our bear mold the last one is gonna be yellow I better this perfectly look at that I didn't know how much incoming bears together like what the quantity would be when you melt it down but damn that I nail it okay we're gonna let it freeze for about an hour you come back and check on it freeze well my job okay it's been like two hours or like more than that let's see this bad boy oh my god this thing is perfect oh my god it is so stuck to this pan no this feels wrong why does this feel so sexual right now Oh oh my god look at that we even got the face okay stop for sure get to clean my windows after this but it is currently stuck to my window [Music] this thing is so sticky this is a mega gummy bear which is what we've done by melting other gummy bears it's like the Optimus Prime of gummy bears right here yeah I don't know it's her strategy to cutting gummy this is doing nothing oh look at the layers look at the layers beautiful red we've got blue we've got green and then BOOM yellow it's actually really nicely done that is the negev gummy out with sliding already that's the mega gummy bear it's literally the size of my face actually bigger than my face hey it takes you 20 minutes to melt every color of gummy bear it takes like 2 hours to fully cool and on top of that it's loaded with sugar it's now becoming a health nut it was fun it was something I wanted to try for a long time I was so amazed at how well these gummy bears actually melted if you guys want to see a really good picture of this on Instagram follow me at the autocracy scribe my channel if you haven't and I'll see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "s6GiYwYvka0": "fireball just kidding\nI'm really excited to share this recipe with you right before the holidays in\ntoday's video we are making fireball gummies I don't know if you've ever\nheard of fire bears fire bears are basically gummy bears that are made with\nfireball cinnamon whisky and they are delicious but I'm going to show you how\nto make it with the bears along with other gummy shapes because you might\nprefer a different gummy shape if you go to buy them if you go to research\nthey're kind of expensive to buy and they sell out really fast but they're\nsuper easy to make so I figured I would share with you how to make fireball gummies so let's go spice things up okay so the first thing you want to do\nis get a bowl of course I use a glass bowl because it keeps the heat you will\nwant a half a cup of sugar you can really use any kind of sugar you want\njust some kind of sweetener in the past I have used corn syrup too and if you\ndon't like a lot of sugar you can use 1/4 cup of sugar but I like it sweet\nlike the gummies so 1/2 a cup of sugar next you'll want 3 packets of unflavored\ngelatin 3 packets is equivalent to 3 tablespoons so if you don't have packets\nand you just need to measure it out it's 3 tablespoons and just put that in there\nas well next you'll want one cup of fireball\nwhiskey and if you do not like the cinnamon flavor you can always use a\ndifferent kind of alcohol but since we are making cinnamon fireball gummies\nthen we will want one cup of fireball whiskey and just pour it in and since\nthe color is kind of like an orange it's not quite a red I want it to be red like\nreal cinnamon gummy bears so I'm just gonna use some gel food coloring and I'm\ngonna use a red I would put about a teaspoon of the gel\nfood coloring so it is a nice red color this is so strong smelling it smells so\ngood you can definitely smell the cinnamon okay so you can either heat it\nin a pan or you can put it in the microwave I like to put it in the\nmicrowave because I don't want to burn off the alcohol so as long as you keep\nthe liquid under 90 degrees you will not burn out the alcohol so I like to put it\nin for 30 seconds take it out stir it put it in for 30 more seconds stir it\nand then one last 30 seconds so a minute and a half basically okay so now all the\nsugar and the gelatin is dissolved into the liquid its melted nicely and now we\ncan get started okay so now what you will need to turn it into little gummies\nyou'll need some molds and these are silicone molds so these are actually\ngummy bears they're adorable anyways and then these ones are Christmasy\nones and it will make this much so this doesn't look like very much but it will\nactually make a lot of gummies and then it comes with one of these to put it in\nthere but anyways but if you do not have any silicone molds you can just use some\nice cube trays that are kind of cute looking or even a pan just make sure you\nspray them really good with cooking spray now even though these are silicone\nmolds and the gummies come out pretty easy I still like to spray mine with\ncooking spray because if not the gummies all kind of stick to each other\nand it's just a little bit harder to get out with them sticking to everything so\nI'm just gonna spray this with cooking spray you don't want to do too much\nbecause you don't want your gummies to taste like butter this will save you a ton of time because\nit would be easier to get out of the molds anyways and I'm just putting mine\nin a pan so that it's not all like wobbly or anything that it just stays\nnice and straight and I can just put them in the fridge easily anyway so now\nthat they are sprayed with cooking spray and your sugar is all melted and\ndissolved now we can start putting them in the silicone mold okay so this is\nwhen you want to kind of work fast so that this liquid does not already\nstart to form and turn into gummies before you get them in the molds so I'm\njust gonna fill all these all the way so I'm just gonna continue to do this\nand we will come back to it once I am done\nokay so into the beer fridge they go you'll want to put them in for at least\n30 minutes I like to put mine in for an hour before I check them just so that I\nknow they're completely done okay so now for the fun part they have\nbeen in the fridge for one hour and of course you do not have to leave them in\nthe fridge after they turn into gummies they can sit out on the counter if you\nwant but if you can see their little gummies now and they come out easily out\nof this see how fun is that and then I'll show you the little gummy bears\nthese are fun too so these are harder to get out a little bit just because they\nhave intricate parts but they're still pretty easy and that's all there is to\nit and here in the end result alright guys pretty exciting I got the\nlittle bear I got the Christmas tree what one do you want me to try both okay I can really taste that cinnamon so\nthey're very similar to jell-o shots of course but they are gummies so let's\nbite off the top of the tree did you ever play like that as a kid oh I bit off the leg. Anyways these are\nso good guys I hope you guys go home and make these or make them for a party or\ngive as a gift they are perfect and if you have any questions just comment\nbelow and if you like

homemade gummy bears who doesn't love gummy bears in my house everyone loves him even my husband the only thing holding me back from buying gummies in bulk is that they are too limited in flavor I attended a birthday party hosted by a super hands-on mom and I was amazed by the different flavors she had I asked her how she made her homemade gummies successfully because I failed mine a couple times before she was gracious and kind enough to tell me I can drop by sometime so she can show me I was so excited I was thinking of gummy bears the whole time what can go wrong with homemade gummy bears here are the things I learned I did wrong and I figured these could becoming mistakes so read on one not blooming the gelatin - mixing the bloom gelatin with hot liquid 3 using choppers instead

before putting it in the fridge for another 30 minutes step 8 dehydrate the gummies check the gummies and see if they're firm enough to be pushed out of the molds pop them out and place them in a baking sheet make each bear stand upright leave for 48 hours after 48 hours late each bear on their backs and leave for another 24 hours this process will shrink the gummies help dry them out and

we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank

we're making today we're making jello gummy bears whoo all right to start we'll need 1/2 a cup of water so I'll go ahead and do that we'll need 1/4 cup of corn syrup yes I like my gummy bears sweet but who doesn't now we'll use this fork or you could use any other stirring item and we'll just mix this until the corn syrup completely dissolves okay that should be good we'll take this to the awesome stove and pour it into this pot Willy to pouring 2 packets of unflavored gelatin go ahead and do that too and then we'll leave 85 grams of jello for this part you could pretty much use any flavor you want you don't have to follow ours but we'll be using strawberry mmm this is the good stuff now I'll just get our wooden spoon mix this thoroughly until all the powder dissolves keep stirring still need a stern a bit more we could filthy a few jugs okay once you get it to look like this you could stop stirring and then turn the stove on to low heat while we wait for that let's check out the gummy tray we'll be using this one's called the 50 cavity bear mold and if you're interested in making this after watching the video and I think you will be interested we got this mold off Amazon will post a link in the description below if you want to buy it here's our gummy tray it pretty much feels like one of those rubber ice cube trays this set also comes with this dropper tool but we'll actually be using this condom it squeeze bottle it'll be easier and faster to pour into the mold so after about five to 10 minutes on low heat your gummy syrup should be ready the texture should look something like this alright so at this point you're ready to pour but you may want to place your mold onto a plate or a cutting board it'll make it easier to transfer into your fridge you don't want to wobble your mold all the way over and accidentally spill it yeah that would be bad now that the gummy molds on the plates we'll pour the liquid into the condiment squeeze bottle dude we're pouring some sweet jelly hurry some sweet jelly catchy song right just made it up all right let's put the cap back on and we are ready to pour stir with this one on the bottom left if you guys are using a condom and squeeze bottle to be sure not to squeeze too hard it might overflow you want to just gently squeeze it and if you're using a dropper it might take a little longer but the gummies will still taste the same okay so I'm pretty much doing the same thing over and over again so let's fast-forward to near the end got a few more left three two and no one whoa we just made fifty gummi bears here's a closer look at her beautifully filled gummi bears I can't wait to try one ah some of you may be impatient like me putting a lot to leave this in the fridge overnight boo and it's the next day I'm sure you could already tell just by looking at it but the liquids have turned into a gummy texture let's take one out whoa I came out pretty easily and the mold stays pretty clean well I'm pretty impressed okay so this gummy bear came out in perfect detail you could see the arms the legs and if you really take a good look at the head you could see the eyes and the nose too all right so it looks good now let's see if it tastes good mmm that's pretty good it's sweet it's chewy but softer than the coming bears I usually buy at the store and I'm really liking this strawberry flavor let's take all the other gummies out that because there's one thing I have to say it is a little sticky though while I take this out so if you guys remember from before I used a quarter cup of corn syrup and it was pretty much the perfect sweetness for me I think if we add anymore it'll be too sweet but if you have a big sweet tooth feel free to put it more since these gummy bears are sticky at least they won't fall up the plate alright we're almost finished taking all the gummy bears out got one more and it wasn't just that first one check out how clean this mold is this is definitely not one of those messy do-it-yourself projects I guess one of the other problems with this being sticky is these bears are all kind of clumped up and they do not want to leave this plate - it being sticky everything else is pretty spot on so if you want to see more jelly videos give this video a thumbs up hello mr. gummy bear oh you brought a friend and another friend and another

day is good clearly tell I need one to learn about math but I'm stupid I don't know what I'm doing how do i do most ah how do I do multiplication I don't know what I do I want it hopefully learn today after strawberry teaches me shy married oh there you are hi there so why are you sorry what are you going to do today well I'm going to teach you what's potations you don't know how Thank You strawberry that's nice of you so just to teach you multiplication starts every four times Inc with the X it always starts every time you have two times it sorry that that would not the best description but what I mean is every time you multiply you have to count that number that much time so say example one times one one account one one time what do I get one good job blueberry you know something okay and I hardly wants five times five count five five times how much time do you get 5 10 15 20 25 the age of 25 Oh multiplication said simpler than I thought how else do I do it well since I don't have paper there's a harder way but it goes by faster say I have a problem called with double juice called 12 times 5 wow that's a big number I don't know what to do so say you had paper write down 12 on the paper times 5 you count what's 5 times 2 you can't to 5 times 2 4 6 8 10 there we go 10 so we wear a zebra on the paper and add the 1 so then 5 times 1 is 5 put her to F extra 5 which will make that six so what is that 6 Steve I was just excited 60s the answer yep that's correct and multiplications simpler than you think just you really have to think through it yes Natsuki so much easy now Thank You strawberry you're welcome and that's gonna do it for today's video if you guys did enjoy this will learning gummy bear video make sure to leave a like and subscribe to see more

How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

Welcome back. So today, we are making\nsome wine gummy bears. I know that ros\u00e9 gummy bears\nhave been super popular lately, and we're also gonna be making\nsome white wine gummy bears and some red wine gummy bears as well. So let's get started. So I'm not a huge wine\ndrinker or wine buff so I know virtually nothing about wine, but when you're looking for\none to use for the gummy bears, I use ones that were slightly sweeter or ones that would go\nwith fruit or dessert. And if you like to use champagne, you definitely can as well. I actually did a separate\nvideo for those, so I'll have that recipe linked at the\nend of the video as well. So first one is sprinkle\nsome gelatin into some water and let it melt for five minutes. Then you wanna pour some wine. You can use ros\u00e9, you can use white wine, you can use red wine, whatever you like, into a small pot and bring it to a simmer. And you can also add\nsome sugar here and whisk until it's dissolved but\nthat is totally optional. Then you wanna add the gelatin and whisk until it's fully dissolved. So the reason why we added\nthe gelatin to the water first and then adding it to the pot, this helps prevent any\ngelatin lumps from forming. There's a much greater\nchance that the gelatin will get super lumpy, and\nit's really, really hard to dissolve that way. So that's why we did the first step, and it almost completely\neliminates the chance that you'll get little lumps\nof gelatin in your gummies. Then pour the liquid into a container with an easy-pour spout and\npour it into a gummy bear mold. Then pop these into the fridge until they're set for about one hour. And I'll have the link to the molds that I bought on Amazon in\nthe description box below. Then just unmold the gummy\nbears, and you are done. So thank you guys so much for watching. I hope that you liked this recipe. And I don't do very many\nvideos with alcohol in them, but if you would like to see more or if you like to see\ngummies infused with alcohol, definitely comment down\nbelow and let me know. And I will see you guys on\nThursday for an all-new recipe.

everyone and welcome back to my channel it's miksa here so today we're gonna be making it these decadent chocolate-covered sugarfree gummy bears that are keto friendly and the perfect gift for your keto Valentine on this Valentine's Day coming up so the first thing that we're gonna be making is the sugarfree gummy bears so you want to take two cups of water in a saucepan and bring that up to a rolling boil you also want to set aside just one cup of cold water and we're gonna use half a cup to bloom our gelatin I'm going to be using the Knox gelatin and one small box comes with four packets of gelatin and we're going to use all of that so half a cup of that cold water that we reserved is going to be used to bloom our gelatin powder so just go ahead and mix that until it's well incorporated and your gelatin becomes spongy that's how you know that's fully bloomed once your water has heat up you can transfer that into a large mixing bowl and then you're gonna directly place the bloomed gelatin right into the hot water and just mix that in until it's fully incorporated and fully dissolved once it's fully dissolved you can go ahead and add in your jello pack you can use any sugar-free flavor that you'd like I am using the strawberry here because strawberry and chocolate are the perfect combination so just go ahead and mix until the jello has completely dissolved into the hot water and now you can add the remaining half a cup of cold water and just mix that in as well go ahead and set your mixture aside while you grease up your silicone molds I'm using these gummy bear silicone molds that I found on Amazon it comes in a pack of three with two syringes in order to fill in your silicone molds so the first thing that you want to do is grease them before you apply any of your jello mixture in there because I find that they release a lot more easily especially with the gummy bears they have little tiny areas around the ears and the little legs that kind of tend to get stuck if you don't grease them properly so I like to just spray whatever cooking spray you have on a paper towel and just use that to grease up your mold I wouldn't recommend spraying the cooking spray directly onto the silicone molds because I find that you end up with far too much oil and foam over the mold and once you put the jello in there it just doesn't taste quite as pleasant and it you can definitely taste like the oily residue so now you can just go ahead and a fill up your entire mold it is a time-consuming process but it is kind of relaxing and it's something that you can do with your kids something that they find really fun and entertaining and it's a good way to just keep your kids busy even if it's just for a few minutes now this cat silicone mold I found at Daiso is only a buck fifty so keep an eye out for some good silicone molds at the dollar store or Die so you can definitely find some really cute ones once you're done you can go ahead and place them into your fridge for about two hours minimum up to overnight which I actually prefer leaving them in overnight I found that they set the bus and they release a lot more easily just make sure you put them onto a baking sheet or just something flat like a cutting board so that it's easier to transport and you don't make a mess so here we are the next day and because we greased our silicone molds really well the gummies just pop out really easily so go ahead and pop out all of your gummy bears from all of your molds and you could of course just eat these gummy bears as is because of the extra gelatin powder that we added into the mix the texture of these is in between a gummy bear and a fruit snack so they're a little chewier than a fruit snack but they're not quite as chewy as a gummy bear if you know what I mean sometimes gummy bears can be really tough these are not quite that but just a little bit chewier than your fruit snacks so you can of course just eat them as is or take these up a notch as well and cover them in dark chocolate so we're going to be using the Lily's original dark chocolate that has been sweetened with stevia so it's perfect for keto now to be quite honest I'm not really counting macros on here so you're gonna have to forgive me for not having all the nutritional facts but the gelatin powder doesn't have any carbs and the Lily's chocolate has about four grams of net carbs if I'm not mistaken per serving which is not that much so depending on how much chocolate you use of course and how many of these you consume I think you'll be fine for your macros for the day so what I like to do is melt the chocolate and the the chocolate is obviously like really runny and it has a really good smooth consistency compared to a lot of other chocolates that can be quite thick to work with I still did add about a teaspoon of coconut oil just to kind of help smooth that out a bit and make it a little bit runny erm and I like to cover the bottoms of the gummy bears just so that I have a coating on the bottom instead of just over the top and sides and now you can cover the rest of the gummy bear with chocolate and just do as many of these as you possibly can on a parchment lined baking sheet and then you can pop it into the freezer for about a couple minutes just until the chocolate hardens and you can remove them really easily from the parchment paper so that's it for this video I really hope that you guys enjoyed it if you guys like this video and like what I'm doing here on YouTube then please give this video a thumbs up

are pre-recorded gameplay from the past ball this one this first game is from today the other game also we have gummy bears just so the first game is i gave my plate today on the 20th of september and the other game was um um it was actually in the youtube membership video so if you guys saw that it was the background gameplay for that but i did want to include it in this video just because i really wanted to make a siege video tonight with these gummy bears and i didn't really have any other siege gameplay that i like really wanted to share with you guys so i have recently started to play ash more and actually really really enjoy playing at i'm trying to learn some of the different operators that i can use so if you guys have any suggestions for good operators for beginners i'm pretty sure i already got it kind of figured out but if there's an operator that you see me not using that you think i you know could be good at then feel free to let me know also you guys all noticed that i increased increased fov to 90 and also i didn't realize that the game settings wouldn't automatically update when i got my 144 arts monitor so i also updated that in the graphical settings and it is

kind of want to know like if he's worth getting and like showcasing he seems pretty cool um just i don't know if it would be worth it for you know because i still have let's dive enough i could probably get two you know like 10 000 renown operators or like a 10 000 renown and a 15 000 renown um instead of getting him but if he's truly that good you know then maybe i'll uh i'll jump on the hype train and make a video for you guys so so all right everybody there it is that is the end of the gameplay i appreciate you guys watching this video i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you sleep very

see what he's doing something's wrong about this bug's bunny why is that why does he look like that does he attack me let's see oh he's coming oh god here we go what we need to get rid of these gummy bears i need to give them something else i'm gonna put down the friendly ones maybe it's the hostiles that run away i'm gonna give them gold double barrel shotguns that's what i'm gonna do let's just put down a bunch of those let's see how they like oh yeah that's good okay give him a couple of these yeah there we go let's see what these guys can do against uh i don't know maybe a trevor henderson maybe a cartoon cat maybe one cartoon cat 8 000 health uh they have gold shotguns and they have 100 health seems like a fair fight to me let's go ahead and let them loose all right look out for the cat oh god oh geez oh he's just going through him he's eating them as as one would they are gummy bears come on get him get him there we go very good all right so the shotguns didn't help i'm gonna need to buy a house here we go now this place looks nice this is gonna be a good place for them to settle down and live happy gummy bear lives let me just get up in here okay let's put down a gummy bear he'll put down a mad one there you go all right how's that okay so here we are in our destructible fortress here very looking very fragile um why is there a skull in the fridge what whose house is this okay i'm gonna put down a cat outside all right here he comes now just stay calm don't shoot the floorboards i see you thinking about it it will break okay don't do that oh god i hear him okay be careful just stay in there okay stay in there and you'll be safe i promise oh geez he's breaking things down there he's he's pulling on on stuff oh god hey don't back off the cliff oh you're exposing your butt crack you're exposing it oh jesus don't shoot me guy all right he just put a round in my back hey cartoon cat's given up oh wait he wait what uh the gummy bear just went through the floorboards oh god he he is noticing now there goes gummy bear see i told you i you should have stayed up here and he's dead gummy bear got eaten damn it clearly wasn't a good enough uh structure there let's try this one this one looks much more safe yeah there we go okay um let's open ah there we go okay yeah this is gonna be good all right so we'll put one gummy bear in here bang okay now you stay there look at that cold dead eyes that he's got on this weird stare i just i can't get over i god does he remind me of shrek now there's no way that anything's gonna be able to take this gummy bear this is my last gummy bear all right and i'm not sharing let's go ahead and see let's see if this uh let's put down i don't know let's put down a country road creature oh he might be oh god he's climbing i didn't know country road creature could climb that's news to me i'm gonna go inside and see what's going on in gummy bears head he's shooting the floorboards oh oh he's trying to get him actually maybe if i just crack the door a little bit you know let in a draft oh i opened it all the way okay hold on let me close that just a bit there we go he was getting a little the air was a little stale in there so you know i just want i just want to freshen it up no i don't think there i don't think he can even get in oh that's too bad well it's safe to say this is actually a really safe place to be this is oops oh god as long as i push the right buttons that is there we go all right close that up all right one gummy bear safe uh this guy's having a seizure on top of the roof all right let's see if we can we can get one more safe house out here what is this a rocket can we oh oh all right wait can we can we launch this to space let's see fire oh my god there's actually a rocket in there why did it just peek out and then go back in can we put a gummy bear in there one gummy bear i put him in where is he oh there he is all right it looked oh he's going down to the bottom all right we're launching this gummy bear to space guys here he goes oh jesus oh that's whole that's this is the worst thing that could have happened i thought it was just like a space shuttle i didn't know it would blow up i wonder if the gummy bear being in it just kind of threw it all off maybe that rocket would have been fine if not for the gummy bear hold on i kind of want to see this now there we go we got to open the top first that makes sense now fire now fire come on why is it having such a hard time getting out of there is it constipated what's going on troon one way troon the other way i guess we'll true that way it just peeks out it's prairie dog and it won't go all the way up and then it blew up it's the worst worst missile ever all right well once this radiation goes away oh god it's killing me oh there we go hopefully nothing no funny business happens hopefully there's no zombie gummy bears or anything like that oh god oh geez he's got a sword look at this massive thing some some about his expression is even worse but the most terrifying part is that his ears didn't get any bigger he reminds me even more of shrek now all right well let's see if we can put something down um can i make him i have these things where i can make them more proficient what if i make him perfectly proficient okay he is now perfect if you couldn't already tell yeah he's now perfect all right maximum health 5 000 health um i'm gonna put down one cartoon cat actually no not a cartoon cat cartoon cat's too strong i'm gonna put down one bridge worm let's see what happens here if he gets him with that big sword all right now it doesn't seem like oh god oh what's going on here guys um hmm not not what i thought okay he died he has this big old sword but he didn't even use it hold on let me see if i can let's see how long it takes to kill this thing with this sword one hit it took one hit it took one hit to kill it and he couldn't do it they're not good at hand-to-hand combat or or anything of the sort they need guns they've got a bunch of star wars guns now that'll do them that'll do them well all right gummy bears gummy bears on an army of gummy bears bang there we go small small ears big smile big grin on him god he's terrifying why why who made this god okay let's go ahead and put down um i don't know let's say one siren head ah there we go all right the siren heads loose on the gummy bears now i've got a really good feeling about this uh well actually no they're all right it seems like they're trying to get inside but the fat one's clogging it up oh he made it through okay um siren has just gone wild on him but he is taking a lot of damage they are shooting him that's good guys i think they might actually kill them and kill him as they retreat inside they're all going inside it's i don't know they just they they require shelter i suppose but they're gonna get him real close and then then nothing then nothing oh can he get inside it seems that he can't get inside let's go on in and see what it's like for them in here ah yes okay that's uh they just see a bunch of legs and hands coming through i think siren head can get in if i bring him around this way can he get in oh oh nope still can't still can't get in they're smart i'll give him that the gummy bears they came in here and it seems like they're making their own civilization now uh they've got they're setting up i bet they're getting tomorrow they're gonna have jobs the next day they'll have prostitution bet right that's just how it goes with intelligent beings such as gummy bears um hold on i'm gonna give them some people to rule over all right let's get some citizens in here oh they're shooting at them they're throwing grenades at the citizens they they weren't built for this they're they're kind of mindless i made them that way i took out their brains oh jeez oh no there's a lot going on in there now i really stirred the pot by putting those uh putting those people in there it's really not good there's gummy bears dying they're killing each other i think the gummy bears are afraid of the people they're afraid to be eaten they don't realize that the people they don't feel uh they're not they're actually not real people all right i'm gonna have to take out the siren ad them i'm gonna have to finish them off they really can't do it on their own you know this is wrapping itself up really nicely jesus oh god oh he ate their head but not their ears he didn't eat their ears because they they had already had a bite taken out of their ears that's gross he only wanted the heads god what's what kind of sick freak just eats the heads off the gummy bears come on you got him big gummy bear you can do this okay you're weird ew what's going on with his stomach that's really gross get in there yeah big gummy bears getting them watch out all right i'm gonna say big gummy bear guys i'm gonna save him oh die couldn't save him well a lot just happened here guys you know that's just the way it goes you you get your gummy bears then all of a sudden shrek shows up bugs bunny siren head it's just a lot to unpack um i'm still processing what just happened i think siren had his too he's almost dead he's got a lot of battle wounds from uh from all this from whatever just happened um i think it just goes to show you things that uh the gummy bears aren't they're not very good in a fight you know give them a gun and they can they can stand on their own two feet for a little bit but eventually they're gonna be face down with their butt cheeks showing yeah i really don't know what else to say here all right rate my flip", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "P8NREvioh94": "what's up I'm JD convertible J and I'm going to show you how to make vodka gummy bears [Music] all right I need a some vodka I was gonna get some Rockwood this the price tag it is was more attractive so it's actually pretty good I'm drink the gin gonna need some gelatin repackage whichever one rips the most is the one you take some sugar some food coloring and some measuring cups pots whatever main thing is some trays for your bears I want to give a shout out to mushiya I'm pretty cheap so she let me borrow them she got them from Amazon and she said she didn't do that great with them so I'm gonna see if I could degree with them okay so you take a cup of vodka make sure you wash your hands first smells great this out the way and pan hot whatever medium little heat it's gonna throw it back in hmm how were you gonna see that all right pull this out alright don't change my pot I hope I get him to click away I said it for Christmas girl don't we need that much this way so we don't put the sugar in it first I've got to bring over the wine okay forget that oh and the spatula a few moments later alright so the block is already sweetened so I'm not buying it that much it really doesn't need anything people can't handle vodka this is actually going to be my contribution for Thanksgiving so just just not crazy stir that in here until it dissolves I have the heat and medium low I didn't see that already you don't want to brown off the you don't want to bear it off the docket okay don't want to burn off the alcohol one packet series packet o3d packet three packets and you gonna stir you want to stir it before it becomes big I got it these nasty chunk you see this so I got this recipe from tipsy bartender they didn't mention how difficult it was working with this gelatin because soon as you put it in there it becomes a big chunk of gelatin I think one recipe online said to let it cool I'm gonna add some food coloring I'm not doing that I let it cool within the whole bottom of the job to make sure got really thick at the bottom those extraordinary doesn't match whatever chunks you see to mash it vodka probably should have been hotter but I'm not taking the chance like I'm taking the chance chumps ain't going away it's a good thing the bottom of this pot is scraped off a little bit because I could see the chunks better in those areas see that sweat chunk that you can't see them over there though use an old pack when you're making this JV tip they look good it does a little steam alright I'm not burning anymore this [ __ ] alright ah [ __ ] that all right back to my spot all right go ahead should I wait till it cools down just a little bit just a little bit I let it cool down all right time to open a row we have all right so since it's pineapple okay yeah okay so that tastes like yellow and a little bit of red all right all right all right I'm going to show you how many drops I use I'm not pulling out the phone again why does the yellow look red on we're gonna do one right now dan it looks like pineapple mmm kind of satisfied with that kind of satisfied with the one truck the yellow just one more yeah turns out right that's it yeah you know what no red no red okay that's crazy all right stir stir stir mike tipsy bartender says we're just gonna sit this on a cellphone alright don't need that go back to the backup all right so I'm gonna use this as a poor okay look at that nice pissy over my family's gonna love this get it all in there yeah that's good all right it's a lot easier when you have a pan because this moves you pick it up and look what happens see that all your [ __ ] is spilling all over the place so get a pan didn't put that on it so right get this out the way and we're just gonna pour be very gentle like learn your pores with some water or something okay beautiful don't have to fill it all the way to the top like I'm doing I don't take it easy [Music] as you can see my turkey is done look at that look at that look at that sit apiece hmm well let's get back to what matters all right it's probably been about an hour you don't have to wait two or three hours that ridiculous ol put these in right we're gonna take the thickest one out see if it's ready actually all right this one's the thickest one it's not presentable so I'm just gonna eat it all right it's ready I'm gonna show you the best one look at that there you ever see oh that's how you do it look at that my hands are washed I'm not gonna eat anymore I'm just gonna put them in the bowl that's it we're done", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one

this month for December first to now December 31st so today we have two year two New Year's recipes coming for you so first we have some Prosecco jellies and we were doing this two ways I like fire recipes coming for you today I'm so excited but first we are using Prosecco in our recipes so discover this technique actually by accident and I fallen in love with it where you get gelatin or you get like any kind of like set jelly and you put it into a blender and you pulse it and it looks like granita like frozen ice and it tastes so good and if you pour like a cocktail or some soda on top of it it tastes so so good so that's what we're making today and that may also be in a book that is coming out in spring 2018 it's those staged here right yeah yeah and we're also making some Prosecco gummy bears just because they were so cute so let's get started so first you want to put the gelatin into the cold water and allow it to develop for five minutes and if you like you know a few drops of food coloring to the Prosecco I add a pink because I love pink and in New Year's like the combination but you can use whatever you like then pour the Prosecco into a pot and add the gelatin mixture then you can add some sugar if you'd like it to be a little bit sweeter set it to medium heat and mix it until the gelatin has fully dissolved pour it into a container with an easy pour spout and cool until it's just warm but not set to make the gummy bears sprinkle some sugar star sprinkles into the inside of a gummy bear mold and I'll have the mold linked in the description box below if you'd like your own then at the Prosecco mixture and then transfer this to the fridge until the gummy bears have set for about 1 hour [Music] unmold and your gummy bears are done then to make the granita which is my favorite part the Prosecco mixture into a container and pop it into the fridge until it's fully set for about an hour or an hour and a half break it apart into large pieces and then pop this into a blender and pulse until it resembles granita the place that has champagne glasses and you can top up with some more Prosecco or some soda I used like what is it pomegranate and a blood orange San Pellegrino and it tasted so good but you can use anything that you like and all right den so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe make sure to hit that subscribe button and bring that notification bell so that you're notified when two days other New Year's recipe comes up comes up is uploaded which is gonna be in a few hours it's um a bunch of like a

"dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "USXB5rmOnmk": "hey guys it's ro welcome to another

it Oh check it out check it out take a listen you guys requested that I make a cute back-to-school treat so we're gonna be making something from my new cookbook look what we're making fruit gummies they are so cute look how cute these are I'm gonna be using our little nerdy nummies mold but you can use whatever silicone mold you have at home that you find and you think it's so cute and you want to make it into a little fruit snack they're gonna make some fruit gummies today let's get started okay so Lindsey you've been on the show before we bake together before yes we made some treats we made a cake and a little tart but have you ever made gummies like candy before no this is a first for me and they look delicious so let's get thinking and look also how simple this is I was gonna say that what the ingredients here yeah now this is for three different flavors you could just do one if you want to like if you have a favorite gummy flavor hmm do that one I can do just watch out the like like these are the examples you've given but could I do like a grape if I love grape yes you can do any make gosh yes you could do grape fruit juice but we're using grape juice orange juice and it's strawberry puree that's what I'm excited about so I'll be putting all of these ingredients and their measurements down below so if you want to follow along go ahead it's down there for you but for the grape juice we've got the gelatin and maple syrup for the orange juice gelatin and maple syrup but then for the strawberry gelatin and a little bit of honey a little extra sweet yeah and we just make them each one at a time and then we fill them into this cute little mold and again is whatever mold you want I'm just using the nerdy nummies one because it's so adorable and I thought how perfect for back-to-school has a little smart cookie yeah oh my gosh I do a little smart cookie so hard yeah a little bit hard a little dinosaur Stegosaurus all the cool things in school this mold right here is from the road baking mine and if you're interested in it I'll put a link down below and what's cool is they have these little squeezes yeah Oh new step ones a little bit of prep Lindsey hold this cute little Bowl okay and then you want to spray it because these are very detailed designs and you want to stick he want him to pop out easily all right just just move it over there I don't want to get you too bad oh geez here we go here oh oh put the tape on this okay that's done and now Lindsey which one do you want to make first which flavor I'm kind of feeling the strawberry puree okay all right so I'm gonna hand this over to you okay and a medium sized saucepan so we're gonna add the three ingredients pour it okay yep everything oh it smells so good it'll delicious smells like just pure strawberries fresh movie though it it smell is this literally just a blended up strawberry or pureed strawberry yeah that's it that's amazing okay and a little bit of gelatin shake that in there shake shake deep deep deep deep DDP and honey it's a little oh my gosh that looks so good I can't strawberry and honey I can freeze that and just do a popsicle right now we could oh no no now your next cookbook I like to stay focused ro okay okay cool so di Lindsey I'm gonna have you do this it's super easy just whisk together those three ingredients together get everything mixed in get all blended and then we're just gonna let it sit for five minutes to bloom once it's blue we're gonna take that little pot and head over to the stove I could tell that you like your advancer cuz you're like you have such good posture and you look so pretty when you're doing it I'm like it's like a little little lady I was imagining pictures cauldrons call me witches but I'll take your magical [Laughter] okay my arms getting tired I need to get on your leg at work okay I'm good good we'll let it sit let it use this this little muscle right that's how bakers are so buff I mean really though we've already got the arms as Baker's right yeah we need the core in the squat so sometimes I like to do these when something's microwaving or baking because it really helped my arms are getting a little strong from all that whisking and also I have to carry around cookie all the time like your cute little dog Luna I can tell her with my finger is cookie she's 25 pounds right now so Lunas six pounds so that's a big difference like cookies like a you-know-who bowling balls I remember when we were at Justine's birthday and we were like standing around holding hot dogs just talking and I wanted to feel like a part of the group right so I pick up cookie this huge double bowling ball after a while like am i starting to lean back just like oh oh thanks Mike see this is what I looked like at the party oh yeah same girl I mean the other day so we're I mean at all okay clean clean she just don't kiss it it really wants to kiss your face and you didn't let her I'm sorry about it all right it's been sitting for five minutes and it is only bloomed look at that it's thickened it's a little firmer now we're gonna take this over to the stove on a medium heat and we're gonna let it simmer for just a couple minutes and then we bring it right back here okay do it girl okay it's like Oh medium we hurry iris yeah here I'll go oh as it starts to warm up it it gets all liquid me again just whisk a couple minutes then we take it back over here we take the little dropper and put it in the mold done all right we just took this off the stove be careful it's really hot and we're taking these little teardrop urse which come with it and you just you suck up a little bit and then put it in the mold I love the way this smells by the way isn't this so cute so we just oh yeah it doesn't have to be perfect and you're just gonna keep doing this fill up the whole tray and once it's full we're gonna pop these in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour and while it's chilling we're gonna make another flavor okay here we go okay here we go in Oh a G in the fridge so while those fruit gummies are chilling in the fridge this is perfect we're gonna make two more flavors and I want to eat these like now yeah this is perfect so we can make two at a time we can do these together so I gave you the grape if that's okay Fanta I've got the orange the orange juice so pour in your grape juice and I'm gonna pour in the orange juice to a pot a little bit of gelatin or the gelatin first is it important to put the gelatin in first you can put it in second but I like to put it in first so it starts reacting right away so we don't have to wait as long for it to glue and then remember for these recipes I'm using maple syrup instead of honey this is just a sweet knit some nice natural sweetener I always like cooking with whenever I can honey or maple syrup I love that about your recipes actually they've been getting more and more like that over time and even you know if you're vegan and you don't want to use a gelatin they have a lot of gelatin replacements oh nice you could customize it you can make it for you all right let's mix these up and let them sit for five minutes I feel like this is a mix challenge I know who can with faster let me get my posture [Laughter] all the squats farther go home I just learned that the farther out you put your knees like the war at burns okay let us sit for five minutes five minutes to recover okay whoo litter bloom and let her burn bloom man a bloomin bird only a witch would have this and she's trying to block it with her body you show nymphal back your apples you found me out why do all those out there like big dip in the big boys oh man they're like okay now do the same thing is before I get your low-tier droppers and just plop them in the bowl oh yeah this is a little more liquidy this makes me want to drink a huge glass of orange juice right now it smells so good oh dear Oh Wendy you're so fast well I just had an accident but you know it's nice about this dropper accidents are very easily fixable yes yeah yes you can just flick it off or once they're done setting you just peel it so don't even worry about spilling you could use a little spoon I just like the dropper as they make a lot easier but you could use a spoon okay well no rush but I'm gonna play with your pup so Q are you adorable girl what a beautiful color like she actually is like blue yeah she's like this beautiful like blue-gray color and she's got these funny Sharky want some I know it kind of reminds me of like a Rottweiler oh my gosh Lindsey how did you beat me you really did such a good job motivation to play with the puppy is like I got a hurry you think I'm moving I'm gonna go so fast that I love her you're just also I think that's what makes you such a good you know baker and so inventive is the fact that that's your process fact that you're very meticulous you're very detail-oriented it's so and it's good it's slow it's good and that's why your cookbook is amazing I know everything you do amazing cuz you don't speed through it alright lanzhi let's put these in the fridge okay oh then we'll pop them out oh look at you look at you here I'll come help you not let me go the dog okay the gummies have chilled we've popped a few out here's what they look like look at they hold the shape so perfectly you can see all the little details and they're really easy to get out because this is a silicone mold and not a hard old like a like a metal one the metal ones are harder because you can't do this the silicone ones you just push them and boom look at that I have one Rhino I want to eat a dinosaur mmm I really want to try a strawberry one me too I think the puree one is gonna have the strongest flavor all of these gummies are a fruit gummy so the flavours are light and very natural but if you would like them to taste more like a candy like the gummies you see at the store like the gummy bears you add a little measurement of citric acid it's so good it makes it a little bit more tart and tastes more like a gummy bear so it's really up to you especially for kids whatever one you'd like you can't go wrong tada here are they delicious little fruit gummies that we've made today the recipe is in my new cookbook and I'll be putting a link down below and all the ingredients have you'd like to follow along a

welcome back welcome back to cook miss so today we are making some cranberry gummy bears so I'm sure you guys know that I've made a bunch of different gummy bear recipes in the past and I thought I'd kind of make them into like a holiday flavor these days super refreshing and they're so pretty and I think it'd be really cute touch to any Christmas party because there's still holiday themed but they're like a traditional candy they're super easy to make you can make these out of whim super super simple so let's get started so first one is sprinkle the gelatin into the water and let it develop for five minutes pour the cranberry juice into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until it's fully dissolved then pour the liquid into a container with an easy pour spout and pour into a gummy bear mold and if you find that the color isn't as bright you add a couple drops of red food coloring just to boost up the color a little bit then place the holed in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully sat for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or you can pop a couple into some champagne glasses and top with champagne for a cute festive touch to your cocktail and you are done so I thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe if you guys follow me on snapchat you know there is another like festive gummy bear recipe coming up soon so make sure to stay tuned for that and I will see you tomorrow for an all new recipe [Music]", "HwrnaIqWymc": "is there any candy more irresistible than the gummy the squishy texture the cute little shapes the limitless flavors they're quite simply candy perfection now these bouncy bytes have a surprising origin but it's one that's being challenged all the time like groundbreaking gummy geniuses we're gonna give you something to chew on right now and I'll connect its general knowledge we can go on and on about all the things about gummies that make a swoon it's no secret that people love bright colors and playful shapes and studies have shown that bite-sized foods actually lead to greater sense of fullness and satisfaction but if we're being honest it's the texture that makes gummy so appealing we humans love to chew and that's actually good for us too but you might be surprised to discover where gummies get this magic texture from pigskin technically it's a material called gelatin gelatin is a food ingredient that's made from the protein collagen and collagen is especially common in the connective tissues of mammals including their ligaments tendons and skin when gelatin is boiled it becomes a thick viscous liquid this is odorless tasteless and clear that makes it extremely easy to color flavor and sweeten when the hot mixture gelatin pigments flavors and sugars reaches a desired balance it is then poured into molds and allowed to cool and then I'll pop your gummies thanks to the gelatin the cooled gummy is now that perfect mixture of firm and soft some people feel concerned about an animal's role in making gelatin for gummies there are two ways to look at this if we are going to eat animals then we really should be using this much of the animal as possible now since gelatin makes use of parts of the animal that would normally go to waste this makes a reasonable argument in favor of candies like the gummy candy makers have also started creating gummies without gelatin using substances such as agar P starch and pectin as a gelatin substitute you can now buy and enjoy vegan gummies and the recipes are getting better and better all the time and exactly

freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about

that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and I would love to talk to you guys and I promise I'll be I'll be fair and and equitable with you so I'd love to have you on email me wheats reviews at gmail.com or wheats at wheats reviews calm hit me up on Twitter Facebook whatever I'd love to talk to you guys again give you a chance to to you know

sharing my super simple gummi recipe but first if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on

dipped three percent instantly and that's back right i don't know i i checked it when i saw your tweet today you outsider trading yeah erica nardini called me quick fast and was like you got to take that down yeah because i think i mean it was a great idea because it was like days six years just [ __ ] say you're about to die but i'll say this about david cult leaders don't die is a great fun and he worked it at the very end that he was like dead silent i thought the video was just gonna end and he's just like cult leaders don't [ __ ] die from covet that's a [ __ ] way to go out go leader don't die there's a t-shirt it's gonna take the [ __ ] national guard to get me out of here all right buy the dip if you want [ __ ] i don't care i'm not going anywhere you think this is gonna [ __ ] take me out i got [ __ ] covered right where i [ __ ] want it i'm lying down it thinks i'm going out i'm [ __ ] got it in a reverse chokehold partying the [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not like his corona buyers i think he's just being an [ __ ] i think he's being a 45 year old trying to be a 21 year old like he always is and it's eventually gonna catch up with him [Applause] [Music] i once in traffic in florida had a couple there was a black couple they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my face and now i

worst one and this was our first episode back in a very long time and i don't know if people will do next week's episode like we're going to think of something very easy like i'm honestly thinking about doing a sunday bar and giving them like a stuffed animal just for a week just to make it easy on them because they won't come back to the bar if we keep doing the gummy bear that's how bad it was [ __ ] like my stomach is just in a [ __ ] knot right now so just ate that [ __ ] thing vibs after i ate it he was like just you know if you have heart problems you shouldn't have eaten that if

as a analyst what are you looking for as a play-by-play guy to make your job easiest ah great question i i think we're looking for just first of all chemistry uh in someone who is selfless that wants

have to build it yourself so and the interns around here do nothing except for sit in the gaming cave all day and talk [ __ ] so i was like billy i i was like billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i i didn't mean to do i was like i don't

supervision he's just gonna who knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles you know so you're actually serious you guys are standing like like we're not gonna do the real one jake we also wanted to test the integrity of this and also the camera like where's ashton kutcher like i feel like actually it's gonna come out yeah i'm so sorry we thought that was fake what do you mean when we kept laughing like you were saying that i was being [ __ ] annoying you", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "Woyk82ct4xE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "6geM4Q9pPkw": "they have become infamous sugarfree gummy bears uh seem like an innocuous treat but if you'll check the Amazon reviews which we will they are actually more like super laxative so what turned these innocuous cute little gummy bears into um the diarrhea it's called maltitol blame maltitol which is a sugar alcohol it's why it can be sweet but not actually made of sugar is this what's we're seeing a lot in sugar-free like sodas and candies and it's a version of it you know and and they specifically used it in this case and it basically messes with your digestive tract on the way down it kind of confusing because most of the time as sugars are going through your intestines they're getting taken out into your bloodstream right but these sugars stay inside your intestines and through this power of osmosis basically you're trying to it's a little complicated but basically the liquids are trying to equalize and get equal amount of this of the sugar on both sides so all the liquids flood into your intestines and then they need to go somewhere so they uh they exit and which is really cool it's really unfortunate what this deli it's really unfortunate for the people who have eaten too many gummy bears but the fact that this was this was initially meant to be you know a good thing you want less sugar and less sugar is in some ways a good thing but it's sitting there in your stomach cuz your saliva hasn't broken it down and it's forcing all this extra water into your sort of digestive system and that's how you get diarrhea too much water in your digestive system so these reviews are out of control if you want to read them there are hundreds if not maybe a thousand what's weirdest made they vary between being five stars and one star because on one hand it's a great cleanse y'all on the other hand oh my god there's one I have here let's see I'm just gonna skip right to the juicy part Jimmy no pun intended okay a little intended what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a cop straw I swear oh my god I'm gonna skip that line 100% liquid flammable liquid napalm and it went on for hours I had five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasting hell bear so I told my friend about what happened to me and thinking it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings a graphic description she decided to take her chances take them off silly woman all the same for her and a phone call from her while on the toy you telling me shed wish she had listened I think she she probably was crying yes so much of this is safe for a person if teen gummy bears 15 not five pounds so if you have more than 15 gummy bears like have like the safe dose is something like a third of a gram of maltitol per kilogram of your weight right so on average for the average adult it's 15 gummy bears for kids it's obviously less you think you can eat more because they're sugar-free but you need to eat less who eats 15 gummy bears gummy bears I usually like 25 or 30 I don't know you're twice as many as you awesome that's why I'm sticking to the sugar ones I'll take the sugar over the other but do you know what this reminds me of do you guys remember olestra the olena potato chips potato chips yeah Wow chip 20 years ago which kind of dating us yeah those wild potato chips were yeah those Doritos that basically it was this artificial fat called olestra and the idea was you don't get any fat but what it did was cause diarrhea really bad and they actually had to put a warning label on it saying this will cause loose stools and when you see those words together loose stools you just don't really feel in the mood for potato chips Oh on the plus side if you ever want to dress up like for Halloween as a sea cucumber all you have to do is eat a whole bunch of these and then like a sea cucumber you too can expel your entire insides it expels its guts out of its very own Ring of Fire so do you think the problem here is what's inherent with a lot of diet foods is like oh well if it's low I can eat more I think the problem is that scientific illiteracy basic you know nutritional illiteracy people need to know more about what they're putting in their bodies and and and some basics about how they work and sugar-free seems like a good sell and like I said sometimes it is a good sell especially if you're like diabetic um but you need to know how many you're eating it's not that you should stay away from sugarfree gummy bears oh I think you should always it's that if you're going to eat them you need to eat fewer than the amount that will make you turn into a sea cucumber this is a it's a dangerous path you walk my friend so I think the lesson here is either keep your portions of the control or avoid multi tall and that is why those gummy bears are the worst sight in hell bears diarrhea explosion what do you think let us know below in the comments oh god no and please make sure to subscribe", "mgllweLNll4": "hey hey guys and welcome back welcome back to my channel I know it's been a minute but I'm back and this morning I'm coming to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work thank you guys for watching if you like if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel I'm sorry I've been away for a while but I will be more consistent with posting videos so I hope you guys have a great great day do great things for you and your loved ones and

pour it right in over here and now we'll need six package of unflavored gelatin I'll pour two at a time so here's two four and six now we want to make sure we get this a very thorough mix until all the powder completely dissolves this may take a couple minutes so please be patient after a couple of minutes your gummy syrup should look something like you this now we'll put it on low heat for a few minutes after heating our candy syrup for a few minutes we could transfer it over to our huge gummy bear jello mold let's start filling our mold oh I bought this bowl on Amazon in case you were wondering whoa we got pretty close to the top now I'll leave this in the refrigerator for a few hours to let it solidify keep wait for a gummy candy and we're back our gummy candy looks nice and solid I'll begin pushing down around all the edges to loosen our gummy bear from the mold and now from the corner I'll begin carefully pulling our gummybear out let's slip this mold over and almost almost it's out wow look how huge this gummy bear is and it smells like really yummy strawberry candy the details from the mold look great too I went ahead and made a blue raspberry gummy bear and green lime gummy bear too so let's get these out of the mold oh my gosh these things are awesome so much gummi candy and I'm gonna go sugar crazy if I eat all of these alright the moment we've all been waiting for time for a taste test since these gummies are so huge I'm gonna cut off a smaller piece to eat okay let's give this a taste Wow this guy a bear is delicious tastes just like a strawberry gummy candy let's cut this gummy bear into smaller pieces so I could share with you all this may take a few moments so just sit back and relax [Music] if I couldn't eat with after cutting that many pieces there's still so much gummy bear left can't believe I have to bore these things okay so I know what you're thinking it's kind of boring doing a taste test by cutting it into smaller pieces so should I just take a huge bite out of only these gummy bears yes okay you convinced me here I go oh [Music] then this guy a bear is delicious too I may have gone a little overboard with that bite but I have no regrets it's so yummy well this is so fun easy and delicious to make hope you guys enjoyed this video see you next time [Music] you you", "JDbazWjashQ": "[Music] but mr. gummy princess toy review hybrids and princesses it's a team I bet the president's missus fans today we are back with another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of today's video maybe like more signs experiments give you a big thumbs up and subscribe bye remember this is fine",

making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "CE_u3Q1yGs8": "[Music] hey guys so it's Kate and I'm back in the kitchen today and I am making sure free gummies so I've been seeing these all over Instagram and YouTube so I want it to make them and see how they turned out so of course I turn to Amazon to get some silicone molds I ordered bears and then I ordered snakes because I know Hannah like snakes and I like bears so it's a perfect job all right so ingredient-wise let me show you what you're going to need you're gonna need sugar-free jell-o you get the Walmart brand or Target brand whatever brand you want I just happen to have the jello brand and then you're gonna want some plain unflavored jello or gelatin actually and this is the Knox brand I got this at Walmart you're gonna need one packet of the unflavored jello for every box of jell-o you use and I forgot to say this is the point three zero ounce box the four cups the dogs are wound up so we're going to deal with it and then for each box of pudding and unflavored you're gonna need a third of so I'm gonna get this started over here I'm doing two boxes today just because I'm not sure how much I won't have to fill up my mold so you're gonna want to get a little saucepan out and put on your stove and put it on medium heat and then you're gonna add your two packets of your flavored jello and your two packets of unflavored gelatin [Music] and then I'm adding 2/3 cup of water here 1/3 of cup for each package of jello and then you're going to let this warm up and you're going to want to stir everything in here until it is dissolved [Music] okay so it looks like all my jello and gelatin has dissolved in here and I don't really want to bring it up to a boil because you know when it starts boiling jello starts to get frothy and I don't want it to be frothy for when I put it into the molds so I'm gonna pull this off the stove and then we'll get filling our mold up okay so I recruited some help here Hannah's gonna fill the snakes I'm gonna fill the Bears up and we're gonna see how this goes [Music] hi guys so we finished up filling our molds I got like one and a little over a half of a gummy bear mold and hand I got maybe a little over a half of the gummy worm mold filled up so we definitely need more jello or fill our two molds up but that's okay I have the Mod baking sheets which I place the molds on before we start filling them up so it would be easy to put them in the fridge since Silicon trees are pretty floppy so we are gonna go stick these out in the fridge and check on them in a couple hours all right guys probably about an hour to oh I kind of lost track of time I've been longer that has gone by and our jello gummies have set up so I'm gonna get ready to pop them out of try here all right so all right just flip it over and pop them out like this and as you see they just pop her it out you probably get through that thank you so here's one of Hannah's worms they popped out really nicely there you go and I'm gonna get popping like gummi bears out here alright guys so there are my gummy bears let's do a close-up they are so tasty they really do taste really good it's not exactly like a gummy bear but it's pretty darn good see and they look like real gummy bears too so I give this recipe totally to thumbs up also it's quick it's simple and it tastes really good and it's just sugar free jello which is basically no points and barely any calories alright guys I hope you enjoyed that video if you did please give me a thumbs up if you haven't already please subscribe to our

These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy.

make keulegan worms you need three main things obviously you need like gummy worms you need kool-aid and you need bags to put them in so I'm gonna take you this one final and I'm gonna show you the things you guys need to make these jungle worms so these are the gummy worms that I'm talking about these black foreskin ones in here go to four gummy worms I'm gonna buy this because I'm gonna show you guys how to make it so back in high school I literally used to buy the full rack of this barn final and then there was another spawn final like 20 minutes away I'd buy the full rack and the goomar rooms again tomorrow final used to know me as the governing room guy and I'd come back with like seven or eight bags dummy so that's all they had and then open a new Lane for me because I paint mostly in quarters and in dollars and it took me a long time because if people pay me in quarters I've spend in quarters I have to buy one box of this for about four to five bags the gummy ones this big pack of kool-aid is the one that you need to buy it's eight dollars and you get thirty four quarts this right here is the only thing I should be buying not these little tiny pants right here don't buy this you're not gonna make profit at all so I got all the stuff that I need to make my kool-aid gummy worms and I'll meet you guys when I back home so before you even get started you can have to clean your area and wash your hands it's important to have a clean area and clean working environment because you argue and be making these candies for people and you don't want anybody to get sick so you probably can't see my face right now but I just washed my hands so what I like to do first before doing anything is putting a clean white towel over your working area to make sure your environment is clean so I place a white paper towel down here to make sure that the gummy worms don't touch the towel and they only stay on the paper towel after in my areas clean I put on a glove on only one hand because I don't want to waste too many gloves and I just use this hand to touch the gums this hand will not touch the game worms and this hand will touch the gummy worms so the first step to making these gummy worms is to get a plastic bag open it up like this actually gonna get your bag of gummy worms like this open it up so I put seven gummy worms in a bag so one two three four five six seven so I'm gonna put it in the bag like this and the next step is to get the kool-aid right here right now I'm gonna show you how much to put but later in the video I'll show you guys a nice little trick to make it go faster so I put about this much I don't know if you guys can see so the way I measure my amounts of kulit is I put it in a teaspoon and I just sprinkle it on the gummy worms and that's it and when you're done you just close it up make sure you take most of the air out you're gonna leave a little bit so you can shake it up and get the kool-aid everywhere and when you're done it should look something like this overnight it should look wetter because I think the gummy worms have a little bit of oil in them which makes it red so don't get freaked out when the bag looks a little bit wetter so the bag is done I'm gonna show you guys how to make a lot more bags in shorter amount of time so normally when I'm making these no worms I get a mug with a little teaspoon inside and I just pour the kool-aid inside so I don't have to keep reaching in here so when I'm done putting everything inside the mug I just open about thirty bags because one big bag of these makes me about 32 bags normally I'll make about 150 to 200 bags normally with the help of my dad something is my sister and brother help too so I'm gonna make about 30 of these bags when I'm done I'll get back to you guys for the next step so the next step in the process is to put 7w herbs in each of these bags so after I'm done putting my gummy worms in the bag like this I'll leave it face up and get ready for the next step so when I'm done putting all the gummy worms in each bag I'll just get the  like this and just get about a teaspoon and just put it in like this to each bag so the final step is to close each of bag one by one and when you're done you should get about 32 bags so as you can see I made all the bags after doing some quick math on this I calculated that each bag is about 35 cents so as long as you sell it for more than 35 cents that's profit also what I did is I'd give 20 to 50 of these bags to my friends and I'd have them sell it and give them some commission as long as both parties agree on what the Commission should be it should be all good so I'd make the gummy worms usually every Sunday and Wednesday because Sunday is the beginning of the week and Wednesday is the middle of the week Sunday I'd make about 150 to 200 W worms and then on Wednesday it depends how many I have left and I'll just try to make about 50 to 100 to get through the rest of the week just be careful when you're selling these because some schools don't allow it so make sure you check with your school first other than that thank you guys for watching please like comment and subscribe and stay tuned for my next video yo what's up my name is Paul I just I just purchased some of Nico's famous gummy worms and I thought they were really good you know the seven really build me up for a

simple ingredients, and make mountains and mountains of your own custom\ngummy candies, at home. Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

] later but you'll be fine i [ __ ] pissed myself [Music] you", "xL-2tI7Pd-0": "Oh guys how y'all doing it today's video we're gonna see what happens if you deviate the giant gummy bear for seven days as you can see I have one pound gummy bear here or 624 grams it's obviously the way dehydrator works and basically get the water out of the products I don't know how much water this gummy bear has but I thought it will be interesting to just put it in refrigerator and see what happens [Applause] there you go it's huge this Wow that's pretty big and it very soft you can see I can easily bend it like this I'm trying not to build it too much so I cannot break it it said very cherry flavored gummy bears so I'm gonna try it first pretty good then I just wear it like this here I'm going to turn it on at the highest temperature here a 164 in hate is the highest temperature here and I'm gonna put it for I think it's 23 hours the highest so I'm gonna say it's gonna turn off in 24 hours so each day I'm going to be turning it back on for 7 days [Music] all right it's been exactly seven days let's put this coming beer out and see what happens oh it's kind of warm sharing this table I'm actually quite surprised to what happened to this gummy bear it takes about eight hours in dehydrator to make a jerky but this one was in there for like seven days and look is a little bit hot in me check this out it's completely stuck oh man look at this so it's hard to even get it out from all the sides look it up the upper part is kind of hard but inside whoa oh wow let's see if I can cut it yeah that's not easy to do and cut uh-huh look at that Oh check this out oh now I'm like stuck I'm all covered in a gummy beer yeah check this out oh look at that it's very gooey you know it's like a glue well I'm gonna try it again really good we stuck to the teeth your son uh-huh okay oh yeah now got stuck I can't get up alright yeah so instead of actually being dry out completely it became this super glue looking one and like I said it's like look at it I I'm stuck I can't even oh okay okay so I'm trying to release my hand somehow okay fine I'm just gonna be like this it's okay it's just became totally like groovy and right now like if you look at this you cannot even tell what is it it was a gummy bear but actually you cannot even tell it was a bear because right now is just a big mass of blue and that's actually we just drawn if I'm just gonna put my hands like this oh no it's stuck over there check this out I don't know if I'll be able to get it out maybe it's not a good idea actually ah check this out that is hot I'm still trying to get my hand out of this all right there you go almost well don't try this at home guys look what happens well I don't know how I'm gonna get this out later but it's not gonna be easy this is just crazy you know look at my hands well anyways that's what happens when you put the giant gummy bear in the dehydrator for seven days well I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't try this at home stay safe and I'll see you next time [Music] now is a bad bad idea", "x4zxCOd-o-Y": "all right we're gonna see how many of these giant gummy bear the five-pound ones is gonna take to stop a bullet and all these bees excited over here that's better you see all these bees they're coming around yeah how many you got we got cherry flavor orange flavor sour flavor blueberry flavor any kind of flavor you guys want I'm gonna need that ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten for start we're gonna use this lifeguard small tiny 22 it's gonna have a low velocity but I was just curious what its gonna do to one of these gummy bears so this will be an interesting test the way you operate this is first you got to open it like that open the barrel put your 22 long-rifle right in there this is a CCI close it [ __ ] it and it's ready to be fired let's go just very ready I'm ready should I shoot the face or the belly I'm gonna go for like the upper area we'll see what happens final so gotta clear this even though it's a one shot you can never be too safe and then we'll put this away okay let's see what happened to the 22 went in right over there on the top and it did not come out I think it's stuck right over there I don't want to mess this up too much right now because there's some other rounds we got to go through you're gonna use the Glock 45 the new one that just came out this is a nine millimeter and this was given to us by gun prime I will write some information about gun prime and the description box you can check them out and this is the nine-millimeter full metal jacket and it's 115 grain okay Jasper you ready ready what do you think is gonna happen how many or four yes I'm gonna go for two and a half okay I don't know but let's see [Applause] Laer hit him right in the belly looks like it came out went inside the second one oh here's the bullet oh it's not hot it's sticky but it's not hot I think all that hotness melted the gummy bear so I got stopped I was right look two and a half how did I know that - no he did one don't have nothing happen people is sticking out that's a half give it to me at least okay I'll put this over here no - so it took two of these to stop a 9-millimeter that is actually pretty impressive I didn't think was gonna I thought it's gonna take more than that to stop a 9-millimeter but that's for the nine gun Prime thank you so much for sending this next round the FN five-seven this is chamber 5 7 by 28 and it's essentially your 22 long-rifle but it has a lot more gunpowder's travelling a lot faster over 2,500 feet per second so it's becoming kind of one of my favourite rounds to shoot and because of the speed and let's shoot it let's see what happens it's gonna be hard to track it I don't know it would be good to put a paper between them or something ok I'm just going to insert a little cardboard between them so I can track see how far it's going it's a possibility I might not see the exit holes I'm thinking ahead ok let's see now that's pretty ready I'm ready firing all [Applause] clear okay went inside this one the cardboard is destroyed this good thing I did this otherwise I would happen I will see it it hit right over here it stopped it's inside this red one run aside right over there yeah it stopped inside inside the second one okay not bad okay so two of these two stopped at five seven next is gonna be this 50 AE Gold Desert Eagle that's better you ready I'm ready all right that's gummybear ricochet usually no remember one time we hit it part of it came back and hit me I think we started with the shotgun oh that was actually frozen that's why okay let's just shoot look at that big hole right there in the middle so one there's the exit wound you can't tell much - oh that great one is bleeding oh look there that's the bullet right oh it's hot oh my god are you are you seeing that yeah this is weird yeah so this was a hollow point I know a lot of people been saying how come I don't use Full Metal Jacket I got some but I forgot to get them so we just used the hollow point it kind of mushrooms out right over there like that so it stopped on the third one wow these gummy bears are pretty tough it's all sticky because the bullet was hot okay next round good here this is why you don't give me the 20 joules yeah great way my your hands a little better no let's do it no you want to break my my wrist my wrist yeah no trust me you're gonna be fine just shoot it okay here well we're gonna be using the 500 Smith and Wesson this is the Beast of all guns we're using these Underwood extreme penetrators okay let's buddy okay I think that like 350 grain but you're gonna shoot it okay okay give me the camera okay guys ready we all ready I'm ready let me put my okay go ready ready oh I think we got the bullet one good thing with these it's not curving off and coming out it's getting stuck in their weapon it's clear it's clear let's check no no no you take okay if you insist no three oh it looks like it came out I came out all the way back here past third one oh four oh there it is there's the bullet look at that it stopped on the fifth one one two three four five oh my god open a shoe one one operation 101 surgery 101 ok surgery and there it is this is probably one of the best things I've shot because if you're capturing all the projectiles at any time you capture a projectile is a good day in my opinion mr. B please get out of here ok cardboards are destroyed sticky hands I think it's time to move to some rifle calibers and I'll be right back let me go wash my hands real quick get some stickiness off look at this thing one two three come on is I going to eat one is better if you don't destroy all I wanna eat this ear this one here after he shoot look this thing looks all red I wanna eat this part it's gonna be this model 1903 Springfield prosper you like this one yeah it's a 30 watt six and this is the thirtieth 6 from Underwood it's 165 grain it's traveling 3,000 feet per second and compared it to the 500 Smith & Wesson just because I was laying over here just pretty low close up on this that's the shelf for the 500 that's the nine-millimeter of course ah ok you ready for this I'm ready ok here we go what do you think is gonna happen go true cabron this is a complicated one I'm thinking at least seven eight minimum go through all do you think so yes yes you know what maybe you're right let's see okay guys here we go fire in the hole clear look how beautiful this rifle is so obviously one two three four five wait stop on the fifth where's the bullet just man I even hit it yeah I was super close there's no way I missed it oh it's here no wait stop them the third one okay oh man okay so there it is it stopped on the third one all its energy was really dumped into the first and second one on the third one that stopped it did kind of what I think it's supposed to do because it's meant for hunting really yeah so sticky so three of these to stop at 30.6 you happy that one now okay yes let me wash my hands again okay thirty out six I just love this rifle so much everybody was guessing what this rifle was on my Instagram some people got it right a lot of who got it wrong what everybody probably came to see is the a K round the 7 62 by 39 just burner you ready I'm ready okay what do you think for this one five five yes uh so the 3006 stopped on the third I'm gonna go five fall so for this one let's see clear poor gummi bears the yellow one it starts crying and every time you slip one three three and that's it again who's gonna eat all these gummy bears now bong I wanna eat this ear here this one is gonna go it's always I don't know the top on the top no no that's that was the jacket from there oh oh no here it is yeah they're they're all stopping at the third one okay so gum gummy bear Armour is approved if you are in a situation where you need body armor just grab three of these gummy bears and they're cheaper than a regular plated armor and they can stop an ak-47 this is amazing who would have thought gummy bears just bring a little lower there's your 760 by 39 and there's a 308 which I don't shoot that off then I don't know why I always forget it and it's actually a commonly used round for a lot of reasons military applications hunting applications so we need to bring 308 in the picture more often and yeah okay are you ready I'm always ready in the word eating for this one max for what what's going on here I don't think it's gonna go past 4 no matter what we shoot it from no come on remember the 500 with the Whizzer Nyjah go up to 5 oh you're right the 500 went through fifth one stopped on the fifth one you know what this means we need a 50 caliber yeah okay mr. B get out of the way I don't want to kill any beads they're already dying for things I guess I forgot my sights on this okay we don't need sights let's go ready I'm ready I know all right Center look it's that bullet no that's just a little clear over the bullet this day this evaporate oh no no no you cut his neck for gummybear 404 I told you yeah it's here okay stopped on the fourth one the 308 did much better job than that 3006 because a duty of syriza expense of all the points have a point the 308 was too I don't know the difference really this looks like expanded with 308 so I did the same thing as the oh yeah you're right as the 3006 but that three or even deeper okay I guess the only the left with me the 50 caliber which we don't have here which will make it a second look olive gummy bear stuck on my finger we will come back and shoot these with the 50 caliber on a different video but for now gummy bear body armor it's approved I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe and as always thank you for watching hope you guys next time let me go wash my hands [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "MVrlBV0dMHE": "[Applause] you know and there's a huge huge candy store so Albanese if you're Indiana around Indianapolis even Chicago and I'll go check this place out let's get one here we're starting off with a red one one my favorite red ones ed says this in Maryville Indiana so Wow just so much flavor in these things and I do have my wisdom one of my wisdom teeth are coming in so it's hard for me to chew on this side anyways you know everyone is doing well you know the weather you know it's summer right nice hot summer days so I've been enjoying there as of late I love what the sun's out this I can actually you know obviously all know my new recording spot basically I'm done being in my guest room so if you all wanna know like the flavors are in here there are 12 as you know we have cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit lime blue raspberry my favorite one and he'll be eating this brand for years and I still don't know exactly which ones are which [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know got the top our own chocolate triangle you know I love eating but yes so you know look out for those videos uh again I can't wait I'm looking for that Symphony more especially and I had braces on really enjoy I wanted to but it's right over there don't I believe camping store and then a southern culture play games for roll boys ice might be however so you know something it brings you back to a specific time in your life I just had one of those moments I don't know it's hard to sit on the floor right now this camera setup is it's such a low level I don't have a chair and my camera is mounted on some books and like oh Lego box that's that's what my camera is set up on it's and then my mind is just on the ground or air so I have to be really low so a lot of times I sent my name of elbows on my F or like my name gaff you know but at baseball practice yesterday and I got a screaming screaming you know this is a fat-free low-sodium Albanese so if you're you know make it one save that free go ahead you know evolution of my setups I started off in here in my room and then I'm like months I swear I went into my guest bedroom so he always [Applause] [Applause] [Music] there is every single very rich [Applause] [Music] I don't open that's why there are so many of these love this color this color right here this is like I swear the third time I bought a pair of these collars out so bringing these downstairs but I'm gonna do that right now and leave this videos everyone thank you so much just such a god bless day and God bless I'll see y'all next time", "0tnY-_pHP6M": "so I was talking people to Instagram and I saw these sprite gummy bear popsicles and I just wanted to see if they're a DIY or D I don't hey guys it's Rachel aka rclbeauty101 and you are watching DIY or D I jumped will retest out crazy DIY projects and see what actually works I really hope these air I D I do because I really want to take a cool Instagram picture of them so I'm going to use these really super nonspecific instructions that I found on the Internet but let's see how it works now what we're going to need is sprite popsicle molds and gummy bears so first things first take off the tops okay so I feel like the instructions are very self-explanatory but let's let's see how it works so I'm gonna take some sprite and put it halfway into each of these containers everytime I don't close the sprite all the way it gets so flat in the morning and then I'd rather yells at me okay now we're gonna take some gummy bears and put them in all of them you could do a design but like anybody got time for that and just kind of drop them in oh oh yes okay wait there's one minute here okay and then I'm just gonna fill it up to the top so now you just put the tops on and put in the freezer I'd mind if I look too much natural again so now I just pop them for the freezer and then leave them in there until they freeze and then take them out and set up like a cool scene thing and then take your cool Instagram pictures because I have very high hopes that these are gonna work okay so I just took him out of the freezer I left them until they got fully frozen and I'm really excited to see how they turned out because so far I don't see any visible flaws so let's see how this works out I'm doing a purple one okay why does my life suck like why is my life for the less than sign okay so we're not gonna do purple in we're gonna go with the green oh that's so disappointing I can't even see the gummy bears it looks so like it like you know when you're driving there's like frost all over the windows and you can't see anything this is so disappointing like I don't know II think if I try to take a good picture of this it would work out like even if I look a professional photographer so the gummy bear popsicle you are Addie I don't I'm gonna put this back and pretend that this never happened click over here to see the infamous pizza cake and then click over here to see the fun fatty candle how many guys to let me know in the comments below right now before you watch these videos which one you think will be a DI do and which one we think will be a DI don't let's see more right so make sure you subscribe to my channel rclbeauty101 and also make sure subscribe to awesomenesstv channel to see more DIY or di don'ts bye", "yJzm2iPjmdE": "good morning and welcome to WTF where we transform food here at the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so modernist pantry com just search V ghen gelatin in the search bar at modernist pantry com that'll get you to find it from druids Grove it is a wonderful wonderful thing to play around with thank you so much for joining us on WTF where

guy now it's the bear turn although you got the leg off for jelly bear the broken bear yeah good ride just playing with this food you", "1tWIrhG9YGM": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make alcoholic gummy bears these are so simple so yummy let's go [Music] a small saucepan and put in a third of a cup of water one packet of jell-o or jelly crystals something like this then add 15 grams of unflavored gelatin and just let that sit for five minutes to glyco phi and absorb the water now the unflavored gelatin here that i use is this kind now for those that don't know what unflavored gelatin does that's what makes jello become gummy so if you just use jello it'll be very wobbly and fall apart you put the unflavored gelatin in it becomes gummy you get the texture of the gummy bear all right even now that this has glorified and absorbed the water turn the heat on to medium want to bring this to the boil and have this dissolve the crystals all right that looks ready now turn the heat off and we'll get to the next part and for however many colors you want just do this with each different color now get something else like a measuring cup that has a poorer on it and add about anywhere from a quarter to a third of a cup of vodka now add this to it now get your molds of little bears and just pour the mixture straight in just leave these here on the counter for about 15 minutes so they can set just slightly and then transfer them to the freezer where you leave them for 20 to 25 minutes if you want to only put them in the fridge leave them in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour and just take them straight out as you can see alcoholic gummy bears the gummy they wouldn't give to do that if they were only jello young and any other colors that you've chosen oh there you go now it's a party so you've got tons of alcoholic gummy bears look at them beautiful if you like these oh yeah this little dude yummy yummy [Music] oh so good he's drinking time I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "3XVZyth777w": "jumbo fella dreamers in today's video I am sharing with you how I make delicious and nutritious homemade gummy bears let's go hit it so for this recipe you're going to need a half of a cup of juice I'm actually making two recipes I'm going to do one that's orange and one that is lime and then you'll need a tablespoon and a half of unflavored gelatin this is my favorite gelatin if you're vegan agar agar would work just fine as well and then you'll need a tablespoon or two of sweetener depending on how sweet you want gummies so maple syrup honey sugar and then if you want a little extra zing to your gummies I actually like adding a drop or two of The Young Living vitality citrus oils but that's totally optional so first you're going to want to get a half of a cup of juice now for this it took me 2 and 1/2 limes and 3/4 of a large orange if you have juice that's pre-made in the refrigerator that's absolutely fine cherry juice pomegranate juice whatever you happen to have even lemon juice would be really good as well depending on how you know what flavor you want your gummies to be so just getting all of my juice squeezed out here and you can see how pretty that orange color is just so nice and then here is the lime juice as well so I'm just going to take one of my juices I'm going to start with the lime one and put it into a pan that's on medium heat and I'm going to add about a tablespoon and a half-ish of maple syrup and a tablespoon and a half of the unflavored gelatin I'm just going to add that to my pot as well and this is where a whisk comes in handy because this can tend to stick to the side of the pan so you really really want to mix it very very well you'll probably be mixing it for a solid minute or so now what you're looking for is for the liquid to kind of become an opaque sort of color and it should get slightly bubbly on top and you don't want to scorch it you don't want it boiling over just kind of keep an eye on it medium heat about a minute is pretty much all it takes so then once that done you want to add your vitality oils you can I meant to put one drop of lime and to came out but that's okay it's very limey and delicious so then I'm just going to pour it into my little jelly gummy molds here these were from the dollar spot at Target probably about five years ago or so but you can get these off of Amazon they actually have really cute ones now where you have gummy worms gummy bears all sorts of different shapes so explore Amazon so once they're filled into the jelly mould you just want to let it sit I'm going to do the same thing for my orange here as well you can let it sit on the counter to cool if you want to do that or if you're impatient like I am you can put it in the refrigerator for about a half hour if you're even more impatient you can put it in the freezer for about ten to fifteen minutes just until they are solid and then you just pop them out and that is it super easy to make healthy gummies that seriously the entire family will love just store them in the fridge and snack on them throughout the week ours only lasts a couple of days because they are just so delicious thank you guys so so much for hanging out with me today if you haven't already and you'd like to hit that button down below subscribe so you never miss a daily Dreamland video kiss someone you love today I'll see you all tomorrow ciao", "z87xwoms6Os": "why are you all here no fingers don't eat me [Music] in today's video we're revisiting one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun and the payoff you get to eat the product don't eat too many i'm back in the studio and we could not do a lego gummy video without putting a fun twist on it so i brought jared from gold yeller into the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions i think here's the basic idea okay here's the basics we're going to probably eat the heads off okay and then replace them with lego heads that makes it look like they're talking and then we switch them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy guys and what they're going to do is they get to bite the heads off jared has the courage to be here with us and we're doing lego stop-motion with the kids so he's really brave to be here in the description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone yeah and what do you want to say to dad um okay okay now move your hands out and then push that button right there perfect [Music] okay now push the button this one right here why are you all here no fingers don't eat me goodbye well we want to thank you guys again for joining us for this it's been a year since we lost grant and we just want to thank you for being on this journey with us and continuing to support our projects and the legacy that grant left us grant we really miss you but thanks for what you left us [Music] you",

make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you

I wanted to prepare a special treat for everyone so today I will be making drunken gummy bears or some people call them rummy bears despite whatever alcohol you use today I am going to be using just your standard package of gummy bears each of these is 368 grams from my local Publix I recommend we're gonna do about four bags and that should be plenty for up to 15 to 20 people so should be fine next off we're going to need to get our bears drunk so I've picked up a pinnacle tropical punch vodka you can use pretty much any flavor or unflavored that you like whatever brand you prefer I thought with the tropical fruit you know gummy bears why not try a little tropical fruit pinnacle vodka so we'll give that a shot this is a 1.75 liter and it's probably going to be more than what I need here because really we just need to cover the gummy bears uh right above the top so you will also need some sort of vessels for the gummy bears to sleep in for a while while they get a fat and juicy so I just got a this is like a little cereal saver Tupperware and that's pretty much all we need so far none of that stuff there that's another video anywho let me see if I got a pair of scissors in here let's get the gummies out and get them prepared trying to do this one-handed guys still bear with me no pun intended all right got our first delicious set of gummy bears as you can see they are just your standard size this recipe also works for any type of gummy fruits gummy worms gummy fish gummy anything you could think of so I chose to do bears because uh when they plump up they actually get about six or seven times their normal size and it makes for a pretty cool party of party favor so we'll have the first bag here dump them all in yep I may not even use all four it looks like my vessel might not hold it all they're three and you definitely want to leave some room because these guys are going to grow I think I'm okay here because even if they do like I said grow about four times their size they should still squish together and and hopefully not explode out of here but you're going to let them sit for several days so if you notice your levels start rising and they get out of control you may need to move them to another vessel so in this container I did three bags at 13 ounces each so those 39 ounces of gummy bears next up I'm going to hit with the pinnacle tropical punch vodka let's crack that open mmm delicious might have to have a little yeah good stuff pretty good taste too all right so we're going to top the gummies off put them in their drunken coma if you look real close there they're just ready to be saturated and this recipe is great your friends will love it good for the type of people who don't like strong drinks you know you just pop a few gummies and it's like taking a few shots once they plump up they really soak you know about a half a shot worth of vodka so we're getting close here we just want to barely cover them and this will be fully absorbed after several days so if you take a look at my bottle here looks like we ran through about a half of a 1.75 liter bottle alright so after we've covered our gummy bears up with our vodka you pretty much just want to put them in your fridge rater and stir them at least once a day whether I mean if you've got a good seal on it you can probably do a shake or a tip or whatever if you're doing it in like a bucket or something just get a spoon stir it up you know once or twice a day and the longer they sit the more they'll soak up so you'll start seeing this liquid level come down and you just want to keep making sure your cycling them so go ahead and throw them in your fridge for about three or four days and when they're ready pop them out and have a good time with all your friends",

should be in the description box below and let's get to the topic at hand I got some outlift action out lift clinical ghost I only have one sample pack so I'm gonna do a one sample pack pre-workout review I know I know I don't like doing one one takes on drinking a pre-workout and then you know given my opinion at it because your mindset could be wrong your diet could be wrong you're sleeping could be wrong everything can be just up and you don't get the effects that you should have gotten if everything was on point that's why I like the run for like a week and get a real general idea but guess what I only have one packet that's what I got it's what I got you know I'm saying I have gummy bear so that's the flavor or that I got I'm what's going to go over the label real quick actually suppose the price but real quick price boy you can get a tub of this for twenty dollars for ten serving which is two dollars of serving but if you use Franny fit shout outs to Franny Franny is an old school subscribers she's gonna support me forever she actually has a coupon code for an e-fit Oh to get you 20% off bringing this down to like a dollar sixty is serving which is still I would say on the upper I would say it's a little bit expensive not super expensive but it's not super fair either I'd say it's like starting to be a little bit expensive especially because of the blend that you're getting here you're really not getting that much and when I but while we're talking about that let's go and get into the labels yeah alright label citrulline malate 8 grams pretty good dosage for pumps not too bad not too bad beta-alanine car has Karnas in 3.2 grams Moog lactic acid buildup help you performance more endurance like they have 103 grams I like to see 5 actually I rather like to see nothing oh I don't even like creatine in my pre-workout but hey it's in here right alright so leucine isoleucine taurine valine I don't know why they put BCA is in here and then taurine for hydration and overall performance it is what it is it's not really nothing super super innovative it's really no reason to put it in there and then you have caffeine anhydrous 3 and 50 milligrams pretty solid dosage caffeine immediate energy and then I'll see the tyrosine 150 milligrams give you a little bit of nootropic a little bit of focus action there and then black pepper extract the 5 milligrams for absorption this is a very very conventional style pre-workout and that's pretty much what it is and I have I have one serving obviously of the packet in here and this is the gummy bear flavor mixed it up got it ready to roll so let's go and do a taste test time and then I'm gonna drink this and then I'm gonna workout and I'll be back either tonight or tomorrow to give you my final thoughts more than likely it's gonna be just a conventional style pre-workout and I don't know we'll see so here we go go for the taste test it smells like gummy bear that's gummy bear 500 red carbon carbon that's gummy bear I have a red gummy bear it is very very gummy bear I would actually say it's more of the white ones it's like more of the white gummy bear than it is any of the other ones that is if gummy bears are flavored that differently I don't know I just imagine a white gummy bear when I'm bored when I'm drinking this so and as you're drinking it it's got a little bit of a carbonation effect and if you look at the ingredients it's sodium bicarbonate natural and artificial flavors silica sucralose and aspartame potassium so you do have suiting bicarbonate saying bicarbonate is gonna give you a little bit of that foam a little bit of that fizz action so when you're drinking it you do get a little bit of a fizz action with a Mira so the experience of drinking it is not like a traditional pre-workout where there's no like carbonation this does have a little bit of a fizzle ittle bit of carbonation and as far as the flavor I'm gonna give you the flavor honestly I'm actually a really good fan of it I think 9.5 very very much like a gummy bear and it doesn't taste like pre-workout taste very much like a BCAAs and it's very enjoyable very tasteful very flavorful and just overall good 9.5 for flavor and I'm gonna be back and to wrap up my final thoughts on the pre-workout and I'll be back so stay tuned yeah all right guys back here to wrap up my final thoughts on outlift I thought it was very conventional I'm gonna be honest I mean I didn't feel anything super crazy the energy was just middle-of-the-road the pumps were honestly not really existent I mean I did Chasse today so it's really hard to say I did chest and tries so I mean yeah so anyways I don't know about pumps I just say it's a really conventional sound pre-workout and I don't I don't like creatine on a pre-workout I mean if you like commercial style pre workouts and you want to take creatine you don't want to buy creatine on its own I think it has some value but at the other day if you're a stim junkie this thing is  not gonna do much for you it'll give you the most mediocre workout you've ever had in your life that's pretty much what you're gonna expect here I think the focus was also just kind of just just meant there's really that much focus ingredients in here and the Moot there's no mood support and there's no exotic stems so you're really getting a really very conventional stop pre-workout nothing really crazy I'd say it's just I honestly say it's just a mediocre pre-workout I think it has its place you know when you want to just not be overly stemmed out and overly um just exotic stems and all the crazy stuff I think it's got its place and also for entry level pre workouts you know for people that just starting off in the gym this  is crazy good 350 milligrams for a conventional style pre-workout that's pretty decent you know and then you get the beta alanine at 3.2 so it's got the middle ingredients it's got the minimum ingredients to have an effective workout but it's not gonna be anything crazy right so that's just my pre that's just my opinion on it and like I said before I don't like doing reviews on one take but it is what it is and I actually have a bunch of pre workouts that I only have one takes I only have one packets of each one and instead of just um some of these trying it and not giving you guys my honest thoughts on I figure out just at least give you my honest opinion I'm taking it one time for the value that it carries it is what it is I don't have a full tub or anything like that and I don't have any connections with that company or anything so that's gonna pretty much over this video if you guys enjoyed it thanks for the support as always let me know what you want to see next if you like

largest gummy bear I mean look at that that's huge like look at this it says here 5 pounds right over there that's one have you bear today we're gonna see what happens when we boil this gummy bear who knows I might eat it hey first things first we have to unbox is gummy bear to see how ridiculous this looks I mean look at this this is the size of my hand look at this red delicious bear that's screaming cavity I will give you cavities come here boy ok so we have the gummy bear right here we have the pot and we have the stove so we want to put this on super hot and now we wait and see what happens next as you can see it's only been three minutes and the bear is starting to melt look at this hmm don't feel bad it's just candy it's just a whole bunch of sugar with a red food coloring I apologize for the graininess in advance because I accidentally set the ISO to 40,000 that's right 40,000 anyways five minutes has passed and this is what it looks like I mean we still see a little bit of the body but it's mostly mostly mostly boiling off of the body eight minutes have passed you see a little bit of the body still and it's still the same a little bit of boiling yeah eleven minutes have passed it's starting to look like the kool-aid man just took a poop and it's looking little wishy fifteen minutes it looks like the kool-aid man accidentally pooped his heart look at that that's kind of gross this boiling gummy thing is looking really gross right now finally realized the ISO was set to 40,000 so I set it back to regular and the gummy bear is looking like a brain I got bored during this time so I decided to be a good idea to put a banana in there interesting enough it looked pretty cool look at this it's like a gummy banana pretty gross I wouldn't eat it but it looks pretty dope I was still bored so I decided to put a lemon in there too hey unfortunately the little was from the gummy popped in my hand and hurts so bad I hate you I hate after six minutes of leaving the gummi coat on the fruits this is the result it was super sticky felt like bubblegum it smell like bubblegum and look like bubblegum and the gummy bear itself looked like it just drowns in lava I mean look at this there's no way who could have survived that look at that just looks like straight-up chocolate poop after 41 minutes I decided it was time to take this thing out because the whole house smelt like smoke like I was so scared this thing would light on fire I mean look at this it looks like a volcano waiting to erupt except it's a gummy volcano I have a confession to make the microphone was off the whole video so I lip-sync the whole video if you couldn't tell us so bear with me as I try to lip-sync this look at this look how sticky and hard and dark this thing is this is ridiculous it's basically burnt sugar like sugar that is burnt think about the next time you eat your next gummy bear or gummy worm or gummy octopus or gummy peach or gummy watermelon origami shark or gummy gummies so now it's time to see what it tastes like here we go mmm Bon Appetit mmm mmm oh it's hot it's hot my tongue oh oh it's hot it's hot oh my gosh yeah yeah Oh oh my gosh look how hard it is it became super solid all of a sudden what the heck look at this look at that oh my gosh this thing just fell off instantly Wow Wow ahh oh that is ridiculous Wow okay let's try this again just want to make sure it does the same thing alright let's do this alright how's my lip sticking guys is it doing well I hope I hope so anyways oh my gosh this thing okay I'm gonna put it in my mouth one more time let's see if it does the same thing okay here we go Bon Appetit oh my gosh boy Joel Oh oh my gosh look at this look at this it's hard again it's freaking solid that is ridiculous Wow this is insane so dudes never eat boiled gummy bear because look at this if you think about it really closely look at what you're putting in your system every time you eat a gummy bear that is what you're putting in your system so think about the next time you eat it will you eat it because I will yeah piece ah dudes by", "GAp0OB_ZI6c": "you marijuana is generally a misdemeanor offense however it can be elevated into a felony in a number of ways and one way is when you take the actual substance in marijuana which is THC and that is extracted in some way and used to create something else than that all this sudden becomes a felony offense it's the substance that THC is considered a penalty group to substance which is a felony and we see this most often in cases involving edibles you take gummy bears for example that seem to be popular especially you can buy them in Colorado and other states and a package of gummy bears may actually contain a very small amount of THC but it is a felony offense or even a couple of them so be aware that what is normally a misdemeanor offense that you may think it's not all that serious when it's turned into something else when it's turned into an edible or something else you can consume then you're looking at a felony offense and your misdemeanor marijuana possession all of a sudden becomes a felony that you're in district court for and facing serious criminal consequences", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "E3aJKfETuaQ": "who wants to talk CBD this guy does and let me tell you what today I've got the fun stuff the CBD gummy bears oh yeah [Music] what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do

a link delivered directly to the product get yourself something all right trust me get yourself something just try it do yourself a favor and just try so until next time it needs your boy big J for VAP code TV where you watch decide invade get you some gummy bears and until then I am out [Music]", "B7WXjXs8L7U": "oh hey everybody we have another fun activity today what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time",

what was the last color that we filled in this big jumbo gummy bear mold which one okay we started with cherry but what was the last color but your answer below in the comments bye cookies", "dkHlrnX4d4g": "hey guys it's dr. Michelle the innate mom and we are here to show you how to thank our homemade gummies what are we making candy gummy yes okay so to make gummies really what you need is you need a good healthy source of gelatin and some sort of liquid so for these ones today we're gonna go ahead and use coconut water these are actually my kids favorite ones so we just used coconut water and gelatin and then a little bit of stevia super duper easy now the cool thing about gummies is that you can really use any type of liquid so you could use these fruit juice that's unsweetened or sweetened with stevia or you could even use some fresh-squeezed green juice we've often done that um kombucha tea anything actually would work and then the ratio is really what's gonna give you your gummy I don't like ours like super hard and chewy we like I was kind of more of like a jello texture so to get that ratio and to get them nice a nice texture for the kiddos to eat we actually just use three cups of liquid we're gonna do the three cups in good dump that in that's two cups and then we ran into our last cup I know I've done this so much so we know that this is three cups even so and this is just the coconut water I like it because it comes in a glass jar so three cups of liquid and then the ratio is 4 cups of gelatin we're gonna use the table spoons we can measure so here's one good pump two three four and now the trick with this is that you don't want that water or the liquid that you're using to be too cold and then you also want to start to whisk it right away okay so you're gonna mix that really really well to make sure that there's no clumps in the gelatin and then once you've got it up blended nicely what you're gonna do is you're gonna actually take it over to the stove and put it on medium heat you don't want it to boil the cycle denature it but you're gonna put it on medium heat and do that for about five minutes we're gonna just screw over this way now oh wow okay and we're gonna scoot Jade over here and she's gonna just keep whisking just keep whisking just keep whisking it so do that for about five minutes okay okay cool so once she's done with that then we're gonna go ahead and sweeten our gelatin or our gummies with some powdered stevia I usually put about two or three scoops in there well sweeten it with that and then we're just gonna pour it in our molds and we just got these really fun these are like legit gummy bear sized molds and then we also have Lego molds my son really looks the Lego most we have robot molds they're fun we have insects molds we have animals we have Hartnell we have Lego dude molds okay so you can just use any type of mold that you want to make you work on these into so let's talk a little bit about the gelatin while she's hanging up back there it's really really important that you're using a good source of gelatin this is not your jello gelatin that stuff has artificial flavors and colors and lots of sugars and sweeteners so you want to find one that's actually a healthy source and not any of that junky stuff this one actually has from grass-fed pasture-raised cows so they're using a good healthy source too the gelatin if you're using stick animals or you're eating stick animals that's making music so we've got to find a good healthy source of animal that are producing the foods that we're eating the other really cool thing about gelatin is that it's got a ton of the essential amino acids that our bodies require essential means that your body absolutely requires it and have to get it from food that's what essential means so it requires that you have to get it from - so gelatin this actually has a ton of those that we actually aren't getting anymore because we no longer eat the part of the animal that makes up these this food here we tend to throw this part away and eat this it's like a nice chicken breast and the healthy meaty part but the tendons and the ligaments and the bones actually have a lot of the amino acids that are extremely important - and so we actually was doing that we're actually unbalanced so by eating this this helps to balance out the amino acids the essential amino acids that our body needs the other thing that's really good about this is obviously has a good source of collagen in it collagen is what helps to make up your not only your skin and your nails that's why it's how'd it as being the the best kept secrets of having healthy skin and hair but also it helps to actually repair and heal the bones ligaments and muscles so you have a little athlete on your hands who's doing a lot of the physical activity and exercise this is such a good way to help rebuild and repair and help their little bodies to recover after strenuous exercise and of course we know toddlers are exercising all day long that's also one of the reasons why it's good for people with arthritis as you get older your joints start to wear down and have some inflammation the essential amino acids that are in this will actually help to get rid of some that information mama yeah baby you are such a good job let's take it off now okay the last thing that I want to mention and this is oh my goodness you did so good okay so once we get it off they're not to be jealous but once we get it off there we're gonna go ahead and pour it in here because this makes it a lot easier for us to pour into our holes and then we're gonna actually give Jada one because she can start doing the gummi bears and it came with this cool little squirter good and then we're gonna want to get those in the mold pretty quickly so we're gonna just get that and then she's gonna go work on how to work at those ones and I'm gonna go ahead and pour them into our molds let's just do the gummy bears and if there's named laptop okay so then we're gonna just pour these in and then we're gonna get them into the fridge as soon as we can perfect and mommy's making a mess of it that's I mean you'll notice that they put them on a pan like this one here so that it's a lot easier to transfer and of course my spilt okay but it's a lot easier to transfer from the counter into the refrigerator and so we've got the robots done now we're gonna go ahead and do some Lego pieces Gina's working on the gummy bears the last thing that I wanted to mention about gelatin and the health benefits of it is that Johnson actually is known to help restore the mucosal lining of your gut now what happens is when there's an imbalance of the good bacteria and the bad bacteria and the parasites and the yeast and the bad bacteria and just being that out of balance from antibiotics and toxins and stuff like that in the environment what happens is that mucosal lining of the gut gets damaged and then when we eat food some of the proteins are actually from the food proteins are actually able to permeate the gut lining which is really bad because when it does that you get them to the bloodstream and that causes your immune system to start to attack those foods you get food allergies food sensitivities that kind of stuff so it's known as leaky gut and then it shows up in especially Kansas food sensitivities and food allergies so by eating a lot of gelatin what we're able to do is we're able to repair that gut lining and what you'll notice is that sometimes kids are able to get over some of those food sensitivities and food allergies that they've had but just just by healing the gut which is so good I'm sure you heard about bone broth bone broth and it's harder to get into toddlers is it does the same thing it's extremely healthy has some of that gelatin in it really good for the body of course to heal the gut bone broth heal the gut it's the two big things right now but for us obviously getting bone broth into these guys is not as easy as getting gummies into them so this type of thing will also help to heal and repair their gut so that's how we do it these are the gummies we're gonna go ahead and stick these in the fridge I just want to show you the end result we made some of these last night too but this is the end result of the little gummies gonna move on up there you go they're kind of hard to see cuz their coconut water and they're clear but there you go and the kids can't get enough like I said we made a batch last night and this is all that's left from all the ones that we made so I just wanted to share our healthy homemade gummy gut healing bone muscle joint preparing snack with you guys hope you enjoy have a great day trust your Nate", "Tz6EWvrKPLk": "hello guys today i'm going to teach you how to make gummy bear among us so the first thing we want to grab is gummy vitamins which these are edible and after you want to grab scissors which are really stuck then you want to cut one of the gummy bears so you want to have two gummy bears so you want to cut one of the gummy bears in half using the scissors or you could use a knife but i like i'm younger i'm just going to use scissors you see now that's the body see now you want to use the other gummy bear cut one of its legs off bruh bruh get it see that tiny pieces it like so now you want to attach it to the legs the broken legs with mixed mangas dead body no oh wait i dropped it on my bed okay now you want to put the gummy bear now whenever you feel like eating this gummy bear you could just among us kill it you get among us can you see it it's because i put my camera too down yeah i think you could see that closer oh wait if this was a former tablet this would have been much easier it's not my chromebook yeah i think you could see it now you want to put the gummy bear and it's edible so i'm gonna eat it you know what i'm just gonna throw it in the trash because i already ate a gummy bear in the morning don't ask me water sorry i just love water put this back okay i wish you all a great day oh oops", "3vebCu3Qiu4": "[Music] welcome to another episode of science is everywhere the home edition my name is Maria and I'm from Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting to see so thank you for tuning in we very much appreciate our time and hopefully you did

comes to my kids lunchboxes I am always looking for healthy delicious alternatives to the processed stuff that's out there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "0MWFW4tKCVY": "so i just want to thank clumsy cakes for joining me we're doing a collab video i am doing the vegan version of uh gummy bears so for the vegan gelatin we're using sea vegetable agar agar this will act as a gelatin for sweetener i'm using more agave i also have some elderberry i say some blue blue tea thingy thing and this blue tea blender is amazing i'll list her etsy shop down below i have some ginger tea spirulina some pineapple juice and i'm also going to juice off some carrots and then i have my gummy bear mold that just came in from amazon so let's make our cheese and get everything all together all right so we have our carrot juice we have our pineapple juice sugar we have our butterfly um tea we have our green tea which i'm gonna add spirulina soup partially aloe vera tea and i'm just gonna add one tablespoon or one or two tablespoons of blue agave you can add whatever you want and i'm also going to add one in a half teaspoon of your agra agar um you have to heat up your liquid first so i'm just going to measure out a fourth cup of everything heat it up and then we're going to make these into beautiful gorgeous uh gummy bears that are natural colors no additives no food coloring and yeah actually just using my measuring cup two ounces is fourth cup you can also use a scale um but i like using my liquid measuring cup and i'm making a mess which is normal all that good old carrot juice just sitting on the counter so this is two ounces i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to add the aggregate and i'm going to do this for every single one just doing a quick photo shoot of everything so you guys can see what it looks like this is for my thumbnail and this looks so pretty it's a purple color um but i know if you add an acid so like a lemon juice or lime juice it turns pink so i'm actually gonna do that but yeah guys these are all the ingredients i'm letting the carrot juice actually half of it is on the stove heating up and then we're gonna add agar agar at all and make our beautiful natural gummy bears so after a couple of minutes on the heat i've heated up the carrot juice you can see it change it color and we're just actually going to add this directly to our dropper or gummy bear mold not our dropper using our dropper you just want to make sure most of your um what is it called i got argos dissolve you can see it but this is very good so i'm just i added in one tablespoon of uh which i'm gonna call it what is this called this stuff agave and then i also added in a half a teaspoon of ginger powder because i love the taste of ginger it's also very medicinal so yeah we're just gonna drop it in there so using our dropper we're just gonna go right in there we're gonna fill it up and we're gonna drop it in our mold this does not hold a lot it's so cute and then you're just gonna repeat this until all of them are full i might not even need all this liquid to be completely honest i'm only going to do three rows of this one and then i'm going to fold do the same process with all the other ones and i'll be back to show you guys what the gummy looks like but same exact process heat your liquid up add one and a half teaspoon of agar agar powder a tablespoon to two tablespoons of your sweetener of choice and yeah that's all and then fill it up in your mold the mold and everything will be listed down in the description bar this one i want to see you guys i want to show you guys how to change the color of this because you see what color it is now we're going to do this in slow motion so for the clear gummies i decided to use some of my hibiscus and rose water it's super easy to make and i'm going to use this to make my clear gummies and i'm also going to fill in the rest of them this tastes and smell just like hibiscus and rose it is so flavorful and then i'm also going to use some of the leftover pineapple juice to fill in the extra so yeah i'm super excited to make this into the clear gummies and then i'll show you guys can you see they're so adorable and cute and jelly you can see the jello consistency they're not too sticky actually and they're so cute look at it so i'm going to take them all out and plate them look at them they're so cute and these are the pineapple ones they're so cute okay so these are all the gummies they're kind of sticking together so i'm gonna rub them with cornstarch as she suggests in her video which is linked down below for those looking to make um gummies out of jello some jellos i think are vegan i would have to double check that and i'll let you guys know down in the description bar but these are what mines look like again i'm using these for vitamin purposes if you're using if you're looking to make a more gummy i will put some other substitutes for gelatin down in the description bar below okay we're going to go through the flavors so this first one right here is a pineapple and carrot the one following it is elderberry this one next to it is carrot this one is pineapple this one is butterfly pea flour tea with key lime this one below it is the butterfly pea without key lime this one is my rose water hibiscus water with a little bit of agave this one's spirulina this one's just green tea and this one is elderberry those are all of the flavors that i created and they look so cute so in regards to flavor my favorite two ones are the butterfly pea little phase three um the pineapple and the elderberry i'm gonna try the green tea one now because i didn't try it yet and then i'll let you guys know yeah so these four right here are my favorite the other ones are just from medicinal like medical not medical but for vitamins because you know you need to consume them every day the best place to store these are in the fridge i'm going to dust mines with a little bit of corn starch so they don't stick together in a little bit of sugar but yeah that's how you make vegan gummy bears they're not super gummy but they get the job done you", "Eg3k9Tz8qaA": "Gummy Bear Osmosis Experiment You will need: Three Glasses, Vinegar, Water, Spoon of Salt and Four Gummy Bears. Pour the water into the Two Glasses so they are half Full. Put the Spoon of salt into one of the glasses and mix it until salt dissolves. Pour Vinegar in Third Glass so it's half full like the other glasses. And now put Gummy Bear in each of the glasses. Leave one as it is for mesuring impact of our Mixtures later. Leave the glasses for few hours now. You can check on your experiment every 3 hours to see if there is any difference. After 3 Hours... Vinegar, Salt Water, Water. After 6 Hours... Vinegar, Salt Water, Water. After 9 Hours... Vinegar, Salt Water, Water. Let's get them out and compare. From pure Water it got really big. A lot smaller from the Salt Water.

yep exactly what sounds like they're drunk gummy bears we're using Skyy Vodka and Haribo gummy bears today let's see if it works so the first step is to dump out your gummy bears using a plastic container something that's going to hold all the gummy bears some people have just had a tub of Ganga that they bought from the store see you have your tub of gummy bears I got away and now we're going to add the vodka they suggest having the vodka level with the gummy bears so about a cup and a half we've measured Oh now you're supposed to soak this for five days in the fridge every day you're supposed to mix it so they don't stick all together so now we're supposed to let the soap for five days then after five days you're supposed to add the fruit punch concentrate actually I chose fruit punch but you can choose any kind of juice she's like it's supposed to make the taste of the gummy bears not be so vodka like we'll see if it works we're supposed to soak it in the punch for about two days so I'll see you guys the seven days and see if it worked well it's been a long seven days waiting for these babies to get ready so we're going to dump them in the strainer and see if they're ready to party whoa these are yeah like twice the size they were originally as you can see the gummy bear is now twice besides pushy especially like jello does taste like Rocco it tastes like a jello shot does exactly what tastes like it did work so pin trusted as a pinterest for us alright some of you guys have pins at home you'd like is to try email us at bus at investors tv.com or leave

gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love to see what you guys are interested in buying so I will

caught great great traction and what you guys do to support us is phenomenal you know whenever I first started this with Bob you know three years ago I thought this would be possible but the watching

but we'll get into this like I said we get a ton of messages I don't answer them all personally thank you for everything but we're gonna go over some of the most common questions that we get excuse me eating a lot of food these days so snacks all right first one gummy bears why do I eat the gummy bears just like them there is no physiological benefit that I am trying to attain from eating the gummy bears like I'm not like hot I can't wait for that [ __ ] Moonie 5 gummy bears and get like an insulin spike no gummy bears are not good for you there if you eat too many of them [ __ ] your [ __ ] up in there you'll be [ __ ] for days and all this and people were talking about it and I don't eat that many gummy bears ain't like a handful of them go get like a handful like eight put like five in my pre-workout like eat three that's it I eat my gummy bears around pre-workout time I love it they make me smile they make me feel good about myself they doing my favorite candy since I was a kid my mom you know whenever like Christmas and Easter and all that [ __ ] gummi bears whenever candy stores like still exist you don't see them too often now at least around here like you be would go into the gummy bears store they'd have like the [ __ ] the wall of like things you flip up and pull out and put in the bag and all that [ __ ] yeah I haven't seen those in a while but always got a ton of gummies it's my [ __ ] and to this day you know being a pro bar being a bodybuilder in general you deprive themselves of the things you like gummy bears whenever I died it was one thing I didn't need a lot of does it's not good for you also making my coffee away like no sugar no creamer just black [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks but those are the things you take out of your life so that you can look good naked so now that I'm not doing that season setting getting jacked and tan looking that's much tan I need the gummi bears no physiological benefit zero none don't care what it does just like to eat them if you're looking for insulin spike or some type of benefit from a carbohydrate you can drink [ __ ] Gatorade you can get a rapid glycogen loader car power drink your pre-workout I take those drink the Gatorade might mix it with [ __ ] Gatorade and it's still the gummy bears in why because like the taste they make me feel good so that's it also the deadlifts and gummy bears sure so that shirt big sellin shirt for us we love it that came from time whenever the deadlifts and gummy bears thing whenever I was going through a pretty rough time in my life whenever I was going through the divorce with my ex and me you know having full custody of kids and being super dad and having to do all this stuff it was really rough it sucked and had a lot of crazy emotions [ __ ] with my head and I thought you know I needed to I needed to go to a place that would like let all my aggression out let all my [ __ ] anxiety let all my let all my emotions pour out and I was like I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna eat gummy bears train back the deadlifts and pull-ups and all the hardship sweat my [ __ ] balls off and left listen him out so that's what I did that's where that shirt came from that shirt that is just such a wild success and everybody loves it because if they go eat gummy bears and do deadlifts and listen to metal and do hard [ __ ] and make you sweat bro that's good [ __ ] makes bill glad that came from a really shitty time so you know how if you hear those things that like good can come from really bad places and really bad situations that it did and that was where it came from I was able to go to the gym just eat handful gummy bears do set it deadlifts we put up and put on more weight and for gummy bears do deadlifts that's my [ __ ] loved it so that's where it came from the gummy bears do not eat gummy bears thinking you're going to like get some great grand [ __ ] effect from them they don't hold a whole lot of good nutritional value they don't anything they're pure [ __ ] sugar their [ __ ] will [ __ ] your teeth up after belly up I don't care I like on ah so I hope we can close the case on that situation I mean I think I think [ __ ] flex magazine was like oh like after I started saying this [ __ ] they were like oh like you can eat gummy bears and like post-workout and it's like good cuz it's sugar and this now it's like Jesus Christ no it doesn't know how it works like there's way better things you could be [ __ ] eating post-workout then shitty gummy bears okay maybe drink water I might be a good starter not [ __ ] gummy bears is that it been [ __ ] or better than she [ __ ] protein bars dick after selling oh man gummy bears I just like them Oh what else snacks that's another question snacks what do I personally like because I always talk about snacks [ __ ] love them and what are also good bodybuilder snacks too that you can have in your program that can help add weight and do good for you so start number one me personally I love salty snacks [ __ ] extra salty pretzels Doritos cheez-its get snacks that's my [ __ ] I don't the gummy bear thing the sweet thing that's only pre-workout I just like those but from like the snackin standpoint like it high would've baked and sitting there got a couple beers in me yep yep extra salty pretzels they're in there there's Doritos in there I like nacho cheese the kids like Cool Ranch that's good cheese it's in there too so moving on to snacks that benefit protein that benefit you as a bodybuilder [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly rice cakes those are my go-to I usually have two or three of them before I hit the gym right now my calories are up I eat the Smuckers all-natural creamy I like crunchy but I go through I go through about 16 ounce through our peanut butter in about three days yeah maybe sooner depends on what I'm training calories are crazy high right now I've never eaten this much fat I am right now it's working out well I like it I feel better I think more clear I think more clearly or clearer however you want to term that but yeah peanut butter and jelly rice cakes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the sandwiches in the middle of the night I'll have like I'll have a cup of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I had big training day I usually do like a large cup of almond milk or I'll mix up a protein shake like one scoop of protein with 8 to 12 ounces of almond milk with my - peanut butter jelly sandwiches yeah snack wise I also so in the truck I also will have trail mix but something so if I'm behind on a meal and I need to keep my calories high or in between meals mean - you know peanuts almonds dried fruit I love that [ __ ] peanut butter bean butter pretzels they're not really greatest for you it's like that's not salty fat guy thing that if you notice there's a lot of peanuts and peanut butter involved with my with my snacking fruit I eat a banana or two a day apples if we got them yeah I do a good bit of fruit too right now my meals are quite large you know a meeting about 40 to 50 grams of protein along with 70 to 100 grams of carbohydrates at each meal five solid meals a day so the snacking is limited and it's like I said it's usually higher calorie snacking as well so that's also why look at the my training sessions need to be [ __ ] intense they need to be optimized they need to be really [ __ ] hard so I sweat I burn those calories I need to eat that type of food if you are not training like that you will get fat from eating all of that [ __ ] for [ __ ] sure other good snacking for dieting that's another question people go out to snack and while dieting the fruit has sugar in it even though it's unprocessed processed on processed sugar natural sugars I it depends on how far you are into a prep some people don't like it I'm still fine with some fruit here and there probably up until like six eight weeks out maybe seven weeks somewhere on there cut it out other people have their own decisions about that I'm talking about everyday snacking uh cucumbers celery greens those are good snack and thins while you're dieting problem is with those is whenever you start adding [ __ ] to it like peanut butter dressings things like that I usually stick to like if I need to I'll add a little bit of salt to it nice and tasty tastes like salt with water and like crunch that's pretty much what it is about peanut butter jelly sandwich but no those those are pretty much my daily snacks that's it yeah I like salty pretzels ice cream unlike that [ __ ] with my belly and lactose-intolerant so I got to be careful with that yep pretty much it locked peanut butter my jelly I think when I go to the store I typically buy like four or five jars at a time but hey what's do yeah no I don't think yo Girt back to us yogurt would be a good snack for people candy you can eat candy too little [ __ ] your [ __ ] all up being sarcastic don't do that late night snacks cereal I do that raisin bran with fruity pebbles in there protein shake is the milk fuckin'-a right that's my [ __ ] take a nice dump in the morning from it all right moving on how much protein should I eat per day oh boy along with this people also get a lot of digestion I get a lot of digestive questions how much protein should be today what depends on how much lean body mass you have right the next thing is is what are you training like how are you training what what are you doing what what physical exertion are you putting out what are you putting out that you need food for how are you training like I said me when I'm going in to Train I'm training like a [ __ ] animal I am going nuts I'm going to put myself through the [ __ ] hardest workout I possibly can for that day and I'm not gonna settle for anything less I'm going to push myself so that I'm gonna push myself further than I thought I could go before whenever I started when I started I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] work today as I'm doing it I'm searching for ways for that workout to get harder I want to find it so it can be harder so I can challenge myself then I need to eat because the [ __ ] that I just did to challenge myself I was [ __ ] pouring sweat I was shaking I was pushing myself way past what my body actually wanted to do so therefore now I need to refuel my body so that it can grow so that it can rebuild it so that it can recover how much protein do I need to do that see some people be like oh you need 1.5 grams of protein per lean body mass so if you're - if you have 200 pounds of lean body mass you need 300 grams of protein it's a good way to gauge it but if you are working if you are doing the workouts that I've been doing that I do [ __ ] 300 grams ain't enough will it work yes will it suffice yes but in order to grow need more in my opinion you also need a fuckload of carbohydrates because actually meeting right now you're also getting a good bit fast I probably take in per day in protein I probably take in like 350 grams of protein per day that's you know I'm eight weeks in almost nine and a half weeks into my into a program so I'm in the thick of it I got seven and a half weeks left of this program so I'm in the middle of it and I'm [ __ ] working hard my body is burning so therefore that 350 grams of protein probably around for 425 on like cheat days were very very high calorie days my body can utilize all of those and I know that through a couple things one being my digestion I'm not when I'm not pushing out as much gas I'm not gasps I'm not bloated with gas and I'm my elimination schedule is now the same every day so now I am utilizing all of the food that I'm eating okay one thing in the beginning of a program when people start out and they just started training either like in week 1 2 3 and they're eating this food and they are just [ __ ] farting like a fiend they're farting all [ __ ] day long and it smells like [ __ ] bro you are your body it is overload for your body you're [ __ ] it out you're not absorbing it all and you are just gaseous [ __ ] your body doesn't like what's going on so that's why in the beginning you have to start with a little bit lower like I was eatin in the beginning I was even like 275 grams of protein and I was still with my body was becoming acclimated to us part and I was my shed schedule was out of control was also eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats but the protein standpoint with one and a half grams of protein per per pound of lean body mass is a great place to start if you are feeling uncomfortable because that's too much then it's too much you need to back down a little bit maybe 1 1 in a quarter of grams or put two five grams then as you progress into your program you can increase it so the protein thing like I said that's a great place to start that's that's a well-known fact but just also take into consideration all of the other food that you're eating as well my macros for the day broccoli protein 350 grams of protein like I said over for on my on my cheat days with my high calorie days carbohydrates 550 to 750 average per day than on my high calorie days thousand more possibly fats you know probably safe fats roughly yeah 100 to 150 a day pretty pretty pretty religiously every day and I attest that type of eating to the way I'm trained I haven't trained this hard like I happen since years ago years ago and Mikan a lot of 236 pounds when I wake up I'm like 239 when I go to bed and then just keep on training so from a protein standpoint that digestion part pay attention to your digestion digestion absorption elimination if your elimination process is going wrong or your fart a lot and [ __ ] spraying the toilet when you're taking a dump or you're not being absorbed it's just a mess your fart a lot crazy gassy body's having a hard time digesting digesting all of that so back off the protein a little bit like your body become acclimated and as you continue to train harder and harder and the body becomes acclimated and you start working into it all start increasing your food that's how you grow that's how your body has a smooth transition into your your progress your goals it's my opinion [ __ ] do I know next ah here's a good one this is it should I take steroids yes no should I smoke meth sure no that would not be a good idea should I smoke cigarettes if you want to a really good idea that question is a personal [ __ ] choice it's up to you should you do it my opinion no there's pot calling the kettle black however that's saying goes no III don't you though you better have a purpose but I have a purpose you better have researched it and you better have an understanding of what's going to occur if you're asking me should you take steroids what do you know about them have you done research are you educated do you know what the side effects are do you know what can occur do you know if the answer is no then my answer is [ __ ] no if your answer is yes and you can explain to me all those things I just asked all right then now it's personal choice it's up to you you're you're educated you know things are gonna go wrong you know the consequences that you're gonna have to live with possibly for the rest of your life it's all up to you that means that you can't come crying like a little [ __ ] victim that this happened to me because I did this well [ __ ] yeah did would you expect your stupid [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] saying a [ __ ] joke you know these I hear [ __ ] crazy stories from people with the Jemez crazy stories people [ __ ] taking a thousand digs at rent a week that's it thousand makes a trend a week no tests no nothing just the trend are you a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep you are and then after they're done they want to say uh it didn't work out for me I had all these problems no [ __ ] [ __ ] you had problems like most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that what their supplements are supposed to do and then they're also taking a bunch of gear and wondering why the dick doesn't get hard after they stop taking [ __ ] or I don't understand the whole process of testicular atrophy or anything like that holy [ __ ] don't be that goddamn stupid some people are and if you are one of those people I'm gonna highly recommend you change your ways so my next recommendation would be to go watch two steroids drugs and light videos that we put out we put out I think you tell you well five of them thus far the first ones where you should start part one it's really good but overall like I said in those videos it's all personal choice don't do dumb [ __ ] that's like my [ __ ] blanket statement for everything I've done dumb [ __ ] I'll probably continue to do some dumb [ __ ] here and there but make sure that that type of such that type of thing right there should I take steroids take that seriously do your research don't think that you can take steroids for six weeks and everything will be okay and then you'll stop and everything will be okay no [ __ ] these are hormones that you are injecting or putting into your body they are going to affect you everything in this [ __ ] because if I can take something that makes me bigger faster and stronger if I eat train hydrate work harder leave wadd some crazy [ __ ] take it serious don't be a [ __ ] don't be dumb I mean how am i able to sit here and say all this [ __ ] because I did do a lot of dumb [ __ ] he did that's how I learned I'm stubborn bullheaded I'm a risk taker I'll continue to be that and everything that I do in life because that's my personality but I'm recognizing that it's myself and that's how I operate I also am taking full accountability for my decisions in my actions you don't hear me crying nobody so whenever you do these things you're not allowed to cry like a little [ __ ] victim well this happened to me I can't believe I don't want it yeah dude what the [ __ ] do you expect of course that's what's gonna happen [ __ ] off job I hope this was fun I have fun gummy bears snacks protein juice it's all good love it all [ __ ] up but stay tuned for more each of Wiis don't take too much Hannah draw and stick the old lady just like she likes it even some

stack of cash you ready to see how much you're in hopefully it's enough here we go all right 85 90 95 100. 100 510 115 okay 120. 125. would you pay that money right now to not feel the way you do yes how much are you gonna eat well we'll see probably not this much can we go next uh yeah you guys are good to go spin the wheel and let's see what time you get so we're gonna be on the same team so we get to spin the wheel twice and then you guys are teaming up with that you're gonna combine the gummies you eat and combine the scores oh five points oh that was five minutes all right fine five minutes spin it again and we're gonna combine time combine gummies and combine money but the money that gets paid out has to be split between the boat carter it says 15 minutes we can't read because you cheated i know it's going to happen your turn okay so five minutes plus five give me five all right so since you guys are teaming up i'm gonna say that's fair but just know that everything eaten combined between the both of you is gonna get paid out and then split between the both of you all right here we go in three two one go oh my god that is tough if you can finish that in 20 minutes that's 250 dollars and that's a hundred dollars for your cheeseburger stuff has been the banker of the day 100 bucks there's a hundred dollars right here i feel like the bigger the gummies get like the more like like just like just so [Applause] [Music] hang on is it only liz cheating or denise too that's not wine liz that's literally yours it looks like it's your burger look at this i don't think that this is a valid attempt take one bite throw the rest of it in the trash can oh man upon further inspection there's actually nothing in here from denise this is only the burger so denise is still going so whatever denise eats and finishes she'll get paid so she's working on a 250 bottle of coca-cola gummy denise you got this oh no way she's actually doing it are you seeing this okay what none that she has yo eric how much time we got all right denise five and a half minutes left she's almost about to finish that coca-cola bottle which is 250 dollars right here that's 250. wait carter come on two minutes left and denise is actually doing some serious work on this can i talk back in and just try to eat the pizza in two minutes let's help her okay fine two minutes ago can you could fold it because you're not going to finish that there's not much time left doesn't matter if you fold it like new york or not a minute left a minute left a minute denise you gotta put work okay all right come on oh she's got in her mouth look at these trying to finish how does it you're probably all sugared up all right five four three two one all right liz if you can somehow finish that then you're set if you can finish that whatever's in your mouth you are set for a 250 bottle of gummy soda that's insane if you drop any piece it's over just like bailey it's over she dropped the piece you drop oh all right so liz you won a whopping zero dollars because you cheated but denise on the other hand really impressive because you ate an entire one of these and this is a 250 dollar bottle of cola gummy so banker stove let's pay it out 250 dollars make it rain make it rain ready have to divide it into two wait that's true hey that's true that's what we said beginning it is split by two oh carter that puts us in first place and everyone else is a loser well i would say everyone is a winner if they walk away with even one dollar our next contestant is a big eater and he is also the winner of our last eating challenge who can gain the most weight in 45 minutes erica you gained 10 pounds of food in 45 minutes so i think you have a pretty good shot at eating a lot of pounds of gummy all right eric let's spin it and see how much time you get there you go the time will be in your favor for this one since the max is only 15 minutes oh 10 minutes okay all right i feel like you could eat at least one of those five pound gummy bears whoa hi jojo ready starting in three two one go all right and he's off oh wow going to be paying out some cash on this kid i might be losing this whole stack right here oh he just ate the gummy bear's face oh that is a strong gummy bear guys it is the world's biggest oh my god there's no way oh oh my okay guys eric is a beast he can eat some serious food and i think he might even go for the green one next whoa wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where are you wait where's he going what he literally has seven minutes you're giving up oh my god i'm disgusting this is not for me this challenge is disgusting i don't know how you came up with this all right eric you still have six minutes so you could start again on a new gummy bear if you want since you spit that one out or what are you doing this challenge is not worth it after seeing ryan out there on the couch i just don't even think it's gonna be worth the money i'm calling it man i'm calling it that's it all right guys i can't believe it but eric is actually tapping out he's forgoing the thousand dollar gummy bear wait hang on what'd you just eat wait he gets one dollar stone he gets one dollar oh you're still on top two dollars four five six seven dollars all right so i'm calling it wow i'm taking a wrong cash right there all right everyone's a winner so six sixty dollars pathetic you know what i can't i walked away with something and i'm not disgustingly sick so i'll take it as a win here we go guys this is the grand finale we are doing jojo versus stove the way this one is gonna work is they're going to both go at the same time and the person who eats the most is going to steal the other person's winnings and walk away with everything so it's high risk high reward winner takes all you guys ready to spend ready i'll let you go oh five minutes okay so how about he rolled five so multiply that by two so ten minutes give us ten minutes all right you know what all right all right deal here we go ten minutes on timer in three two one start oh he's going for the hot dog hot dog it's a hundred bucks if you can finish it 250 dollars if you can jojo eat like half of that jojo that's a hundred dollar hot dog yeah at this rate he's gonna eat four of those before subjects are ones i mean he might crush the plate of them oh oh he's got it where's the honey hundred bucks for jojo 100 he has to finish it he's gotta finish it but it's right here for you jojo will be officially in first place for this final round and uh remember guys whoever eats the most in this round steals the other person's eatings and earnings so winner takes all no slow mo slow we sell a lot of time left i don't know you just swallowed it the boy has got too much on his plate he's gonna he's gonna make it work i guess technically you could spit it out as long as you still eat it what's wrong with you eyes on the fries i think after this video we're never doing an eating challenge ever again five minutes left eyes on the prize i need some yeezys that's as big as the money you're so close i don't want to throw up after you take your time i mean look you got three and a half years so you can do the mail trip at the end yeah jojo's really clean it up jojo is done that's a hundred bucks ryan payman right here juice that's fine i'll give it to him yeah you get through after think about that jojo you realize if he finishes i know you lose because that's 250. i don't think he is dude that crust is crazy this is so much this that's a long a minute and ten two more dollars just 103. 25 seconds stove just has to get it in his mouth for it to count and then he ultimately has to finish eating it at some point later after the timer am i 110 i haven't seen anyone do that successfully so i think it's a lot harder than it sounds like three four one two three four five six seven eight elbows count you walk away with 250 plus jojo's 100 and change this is really exciting guys this is a very exciting fun round place your bets right now who is going to win we're going to check back in here on stove and see if you can finish you can't go this far just to lose though i mean jojo wants to do it he's actually put in some serious work though oh wait there's one there's a loose piece no i don't know so seriously if that somehow slips and falls it's game over yeah oh oh no oh no what yeah guys no carter there's no way that counts you know he said you said if it touches the ground he loses he said he can't use your hands no hands no hands ugh done all right all right hang on hang on here is the final ruling so the timer ended his stove did not finish his pizza but he did not use his hands and he was able to get it done because he had it all in his mouth and then the timer but he then dropped one little piece which then he ate without using his hands so does that count as a disqualification i'm not sure because also jojo has at least a little tiny piece of equal size of equal size so it's snowdrop so i would say that maybe stone what might end up being the winner but i feel like maybe we should leave it to you guys to vote in the comments down below who should walk away or should jojo keep his winnings and should still keep his winnings i think both of them worked really hard yeah i think they both deserve what they oh yeah i think they're gonna leave jojo and stove because that was a tough round hey guys the bank saw you did a really good job hey hang on hey that's my cash yeah what are you doing guys the bank thought you did great hey here we go ryan give me my money back anyways guys comment down below what you guys would eat and how many of these gummy bears would eat i'll see you guys on the next vlog [Music] piece [Music] you", "y93sN53bbdo": "Sour Gummies Gummy Candy Easy Recipe - Heghineh Cooking Show", "-Yi_AktzXhw": "guys welcome back to the vlog hey no don't give it away yet so today is a very exciting day because as you guys probably saw in Nathan's video he posted a couple days ago he did this crazy gummy bear and gummy worm like unwrapping whatever and we didn't want to throw away all the stuff so we were like let's just destroy it instead of throwing it away so we're gonna be doing some ridiculous things like catching it on fire putting a machete to it seeing how that works and lots of other extremely ridiculous things that aren't necessary but are extremely cool and we're gonna do it anyways so uh I haven't shown you all the gummy bear yet so this is the poor guy that will be tortured today just to give you a size reference and I've got a pretty fat head if that gives you anything how excited are you I'm yeah okay guys so look at all the stuff that we have so we have machete a bat will show you guys what that's for later and wrote those another yeah and a blowtorch you'll guys find out why we have that later we got some colored flames oh I thought it was pretty cool so I don't know how that's gonna change the color of your fire okay and some lighter fluid yellow also figure out what we're using that for so there we go withouta oh yeah of course gotta have the GoPro but um I guess without further ado we're gonna get this show on the road so after debating we've decided to set it on fire first cuz I think that'll be the least damaging because if we start off with the most damaging it's gonna be a quite a short video but he's all set up and ready I'm gonna soak them in lighter fluid maybe that'll help him catch on fire a little easier I've never tried to catch a gummy bear on fire before but um I don't think gelatin is very flammable so we're gonna have to douse um and some lighter fluid all right guys so I'm gonna use this as the lighting tool because you're insane if you think I'm just gonna stick my hand up to this lighter fluid soaked gummy bear and box so um I'm really scared I'm not gonna lie because I have no idea how this is going to go and worst gets the worst mail a kinda I want to get the flame down in his belly but I don't want to like touch it hey let's try and light the box on fire all right let's see what that does like I said don't try this at home please wait we should try that colored a fire thing oh it smells like a roasted gummy bears I'm scared I kind of want to put him out I don't want to get like a home complaint of like burning our house down I don't know so we move on to the next thing what do you think it's getting a little out of control okay okay he's literally boiling look at the side oh look at his butt oh no he's boiling into the box oh no that poor gummy bear you got it well then he's not even like barely damaged he's melted to the box well it's not hot at all huh well the neighbors probably thought that we were roasting marshmallows but little did they know we just said a giant gummy bear on fire oh it's still boiling over here look you can see the little bubbles I can like feel the heat coming off of him he's got a little stomach full of a lighter fluid and water yeah I don't want it to be like super hot no I think he's fine is that okay yeah the wait for it to cool off I guess all right guys so now that we have set this gummy bear on fire this poor little buddy and his belly's full of lighter fluid I've put the Oh God I've put these gloves on for that exact reason because I don't want to get my hands all nasty I'm about to climb up on that ladder to go up to that roof and climb all the way across and then drop it down on the concrete so um I guess the best thing to say is cross my fingers I don't fall off we'll see like I said this is why I work gloves it's making it a little difficult but this gummy bear has melted so much oh God but that over the oh I don't know how I feel about the smell it's like marshmallow mixed with extreme sugar content so Nathan's gonna hand that to me that's here and I'm gonna climb up over here on this ladder and he's gonna try and hand it to me while I'm climbing up there do this alright guys well that did not work at all because we've tried every single point you see this and you see all that extra room it's just not happening our roof is too tall and we have too small of a lapper and it's just not happening so I guess I put the gloves on for nothing I'm a little sad about it but um I think instead what we're gonna do is beat it with a bat these bar gummy bears bout to have his last like I've never played baseball but I'm sure hitting this will be crazy okay just don't listen to the concrete [Laughter] I feel like I need to sit him up first so give me at least okay okay he's literally absorbed my glove okay feel like this is some sort of quicksand okay just kidding okay okay gross first off we're gonna have such a mess to clean up hey you're the one who wanted to set him on fire so for a reason but he he went off the box he wasn't supposed to okay now he's sticking to that part anyway you put him he's mix two against this buddy just do that alright now let's actually do this I don't know how but I guess it's time for a new Apple watch swing swing better better better better better swing breaking it all like doing nothing literally nothing like wow it doesn't even look like touch them just literally nothing let me show you the damage that this gummy bear has taken and by damage I mean practically perfect conditions I mean other than him being completely burnt and melted but yeah well you know what I mean he basically I mean it's a bunch of jelly I mean like I don't I don't know what to do um just absorbs all of it actually I got a pretty good idea I know basically what we're doing is heating this knife or should I say machete so hot that we're going to just slice through the gummy bear so I'm hopefully this smells really bad and so I feel like I'm burning it too much so I kind of want to test it out I'm gonna keep the flame on there as we walk over there but let's see if this actually slices something moment of truth come on this side so you guys can see I guess I'll just slice through his face just try like a spear actually no slices here yeah that's a good idea all right you guys ready yep good yeah oh I literally put his ear off that was pretty cool okay victory that is victory tell me the machete Queen we have beaten the gummy bear we have set him on fire we have cuts his ear off with a machete we tried to drop him off of a roof but I couldn't get up there so we spared him on that one but I think it's really time to finish him it's starting to sprinkle so we got to hurry up and destroy this thing this is his official grave this is it his official grave and I'm just gonna blow torch his face off so leave a like if you think that's a good idea go ahead all right three two one oh that was anti-climatic let's try that again three two one literally sizzling it's boiling on the spot let's see what happens when I just keep it in one spot but in one spot for like a minute or two it smells like marshmallows I know that's a campfire who knew um alright well even with a blowtorch it's gonna take like hours of doing that uh it it barely even did anything like it looked like it was actually doing something like let me use this glove actually that's probably gonna be really hot but I sat on that one same spot and it like didn't even do anything so I don't even think there's enough like gas in this blowtorch to be able to do anything to his actual face so um gummy bears are indestructible I think that's the conclusion here even though he is pretty messed up like it's still a gummy bear you can still tell it's counter he's missing an ear but it's still a gummy bear so yeah alright guys so like I said lesson learned is that gummy bears are indestructible even if you chop off an ear and you set it on fire douse it in lighter fluid and beat it with a bat so that's that's just about it I don't know what else is left to do except to I don't even know maybe like blow it up with an actual like bomb or something I don't know but obviously that's not going to happen but I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is going to

know either way [Music] so [Music] oh [Music]", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "1E5---nUtTM": "I don't know I mean how hot can it beat one gummy bears a good also bid army welcome back or if this your first time watching the channel and you love watching Harry doozy on this occasion pure Hellfire synthesized into a tiny little bite-sized piece of food then you're in the right place so think about subscribing but today we are doing the today we're doing the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear now this thing clocks in nine million scovilles which is not the hottest thing I've ever eaten but it's not enough that has got me very worried that means it's 900 times hotter than a jalapeno I'm like three times hotter than police pepper spray and I'm three for three now on spicy challenges I successfully finished the one ship challenge the Death Note and the world's hot chocolate bar but I failed the tuatara which was 30 million scovilles almost call an ambulance the toe of satan and the chicken wings britain's hot chicken wings from a couple of weeks ago so i'm hoping to make it four out of seven today which means i'm more successful than unsuccessful but as most you know by now I really hate spicy food I actually got this from a very kind subscriber it came in a big care package full of stuff but I've gone back to our messages and I can't find out the name of the person that sent this to me but if you did send us me it really means the world to me just hopefully I don't die and we don't get your honor manslaughter charges but um yeah the rules of this thing are two minutes in your mouth and then after you've swallowed it's five minutes after boom that's always the tricky part for me so without further ado this is Benny's food and this is the world's hottest gummy bear challenge right so it's one single gummy bear shouldn't be this hard oh there we go right so far is not too bad you know they said you got to move around alpha he's got very very slowly you start to salivate more now oh I shall we will it's still there well the videos I've seen says don't chew it too much you don't wanna break it down before two minutes but now that's not it's not melting so my troops I can swallow after two minutes so it's hot hiccup results when you know if you hiccup it's like a million or so at least your alternate hook is long well why not this wins but both see around the mouth it's not true people won't believe that okay bro but I'll show it to the camera so OD milk me are these two day two days past its sell-by date it's really guess the roof of the mouth it's weird are different things some get you here some get you the throat this is a dry out of the roof yeah the book ready yet the milk ready why do you do this every time just getting ready please I feel like sucking Bartoli helps a bit in a weird way thank you I think it's kind of level it out this is looking secret it's really bright 22nd of September 24th today okay so I got to get to six minutes I think it's taper it off now let's stop like it got a little a little drip on the end of my schnoz didn't you see no camera you look a little bit yeah you look a little bit disappointed I think you expected more pain right I expected more pain thankfully we only have wood anymore stuff right so he finished that kind of was mostly around the roof of the mouth yeah I'm not I'm normally absolutely desperate for it or ice cream or something but get a little on single little face tingle not too not too much it ahead know what tastes good it's not lump it's fine it's it it says it's nine million I'm not sure if it's because of the way it's kind of made into the gummy bear it's nowhere near the toss it table sayin oh but the giant they're really giant gummy bear that'd be brutal we don't normally have whole milk goodness this is this is usually a skim a skimmed milk household so I've got a whole middle but yeah that's a pretty good if you want bragging rights I would say that's a good challenge to do because it's it says it's nine million scovilles but that wasn't quite as far as the one ship the wardship I found quite hard this is unpleasant but it's not I don't think you could do it most people that are you know don't make her enormous salts will probably find it quite difficult and quit but if you don't I mean I don't like spicy food at all and that's doable I'm okay no I'm not absolutely chug in the milk and asking for Ben and Gary sorry I didn't think that will be actually quite a lot more entertaining oh thanks for watching catch catch you at the next one [Music]", "lkTLGySENVU": "Hi Bold Bakers! Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "tczNwJMnG6M": "[Music] today I'm showing you three ways to use agar agar if you've never heard of agar before it's a plant-based gelling agent that's actually made from seaweed and it's most commonly used as a plant-based alternative to gelatin I partnered up with a company called living Djinn who sent me their agar agar to use in all three of these recipes there are a small Korean based health food startup and they've been really patient with me over the last few weeks while I took some time to test out the quality of the product I found that the results I've gotten have been really consistent I also found that I didn't end up using as much of the living gin agar as I have had to use of other brands in the past nor did I have to boil it as long to get good gelling results so if you want to try out any of these recipes or any other agar based recipes at home I would definitely recommend the agar from living Jin I've placed a link in the description below if you want to check it out for the first recipe I'm making gummy bears so most gummy candies are actually made with a ton of gelatin so that can be one kind of off-putting and to really restricting for people with dietary restrictions preferences or religious beliefs so you can actually use agar as a replacement all you need is 250 millilitres of fruit juice six grams of agar [Music] and 25 grams of sugar mix this all together in a pot and boil for one to two minutes it's important to boil any mixture with agar in it because the boiling activates the gelling properties so make sure you get it up to a rolling boil then all you need are some of these super cute gummy bear molds I just got them on Amazon and they came with these little droppers so you can transfer your gummy bear mixture into the molds set them aside to chill in the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes and once they're firm to the touch pop them out of the mold [Music] then you can repeat this process for whatever flavor of gummy candy you'd like one thing I hear often when people make egg are based gummies is that it's hard to get the same true texture but I found a super simple solution to this you just have to dehydrate them a little all I normally do is leave them out on a drying rack for a day or two to dehydrate slightly and then you end up with that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] another great way to use Egger is in puddings panna cotta or mousse today I'm making a matcha green-tea mousse you'll need 150 grams of white chocolate chopped and set aside in a large bowl pour 500 milliliters of coconut milk and 85 grams of honey into a pot and bring to a simmer [Music] pour the simmering liquid over the white chocolate and stir to combine in a separate pop place six grams of agar 7 grams of matcha green-tea powder and three to five tablespoons of water bring this to a boil for one to two minutes for the green tea mixture into the coconut mixture and stir [Music] to get a really smooth consistency blend the mixture on high then transfer it to individual serving bowls and set in the fridge once the matcha mousse is set you can serve it as is or top it with a sprinkle of matcha or sesame seeds [Music] next and probably one of my favorite ways to use Egger is by using it to make gourmet or molecular style recipes for this recipe I'm making grapefruit pearls start by pouring about a liter of neutral flavored oil into a tall container and placing this in the freezer for about one to two hours once your oil is cold get 250 milliliters of grapefruit juice into a pot along with 2 grams of agar powder [Music] bring this up to a boil now for the fun part using a squeeze bottle or syringe stream the grape fruit mixture into the oil and droplets [Music] strain the pearls out from the oil and rinse in cold water you can make these pearls with most liquids I've done these with honey balsamic vinegar and sriracha just to name a few special thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video if you want to try it any of these recipes make sure to check out the link in the description box below and if you're lucky enough to live in LA you can now purchase the living gin agar offline at the Little Tokyo marketplace Los Angeles I'll post links to their social below as well because they post lots of cool recipes so you might want to check that out and as always thanks for watching and if you liked the video consider subscribing and connecting with me

will [ __ ] you up with just a small amount i think it is [ __ ] how many are you the people who are sleeping on 10 give me a number what's the number to beat because if you're gonna say eat 500 of them i'm gonna say yeah i could eat 500 twix bars and i'm sure i'd be barfing into my like that's not the that defeats the purp 20 all right chat we'll start this with 20 then all right i have one two

put 20 down you guys are like only 20. okay what do you need to tell me alex um i read online about the gummy bears okay people said that you should that 15 will be good enough and 20 would be more than that so don't i don't think you should keep eating them more than 20. what i already ate i know so i don't think you should keep eating more did you did you research this at all i'm sorry i thought this was america but what if it doesn't oh i already feel a little grumbling all right i'm gonna keep it rohana with you guys we are 11 minutes in i am already feeling not hot i already am

i'm gonna eat another one right now two more come on update the counter actually two more just for fun just for the just for the for the um just for the culture they're really tasty they really are half hour i started feeling weird oh no look at the timer i'm feeling the way i would describe the way i'm feeling right now is i would not go out if i was invited somewhere at this point i feel a storm coming all that matters right now is that clock keeps ticking there is a warning on the package that reads consumption of sugar-free candies may cause stomach discomfort and or laxative effect individual tolerance will vary if this is the first time you've tried these candies we recommend beginning with one fourth of a serving size or less this guy's making me confident that i have nothing to worry about so i'm gonna eat three more just to make it just to make it an even 30. there's nothing honestly if this guy can eat a whole bag well maybe even 30. i shouldn't have done that all right let's see let's maybe your guys's media share will make me laugh right as you can tell by the video this video is all about poo and how to hold in your poo when they didn't even get to it okay i'm i'm gonna give you guys an update on how my stomach feels i feel like there is a small balloon in my stomach right now that's slowly being blown up and the only way there's any relief okay update on

they will love it so what we're going to do is we're going to take 1/3 cup of regular tap water and we're going to take one package of jell-o and I got cherry jello cuz we're gonna make cinnamon I kind of thought the red cherry would go with the cinnamon but you can use whatever kind you like you can make all kinds of different kinds so we're going to go ahead and put our package of jell-o in Yeah right we're also going to put in three envelopes of gelatine this is basically unflavored gelatin we need to get our jello basically super power to be able to make our gummy bears so we're gonna really give this little bit of water a lot of gelatin these are 0.25 ounce packages of jello and I this recipe I actually don't know where it originally came from making gummy bears there's this recipe is all over the internet so I can't really give credit to the person who actually made this because there's no way to know who it was if you happen to know then let me know right but thank you to whoever that was that developed this so we have a package this is a three ounce package of jell-o we have three package of gelatine and we have a third of a cup of water now to give us our cinnamon flavor we are going to add some cinnamon oil and you get it in this little two pack of these little things I got this at Michael's if you use a coupon they're really inexpensive they're only like a couple dollars anyway and I still use the coupon and I'm going to use a quarter teaspoon of the cinnamon oil this is going to give us our cinnamon flavor you can use as much or as little as you want quarter teaspoon gives you a nice cinnamon flavor you can actually supercharge it and put a whole bunch so we're going to go ahead and stir this up and combine this right here off the heat just make sure you kind of get the lumps out of it ooh I can smell the cinnamon you get actually any kind of oils that you can find you can make flavor if I can find some hot chili pepper oil Eric could love hot chili pepper gummy bears I've even seen people make adult gummy bears and you know what I mean with that little vodka a little brandy all that fun stuff so we've got this combined and we're going to go ahead and let this sit for five minutes off the heat then we're going to put it on the heat and melt it so after five minutes it's like gels up and it looks like this it's not hard it's really soft but it looks like this kind of consistency that gelatine really gels really fast so we're going to put it over a medium burner and we're gonna let it melt so let's put it over on the burner I already have it preheated you just want to continually to stir so it's nice and melted so now it's all melted we want to loop move our liquid into something that has a pour spout because we're going to put these in our molds and if you don't have a pour spout you're gonna make a mess and this red coloring could stain your counter so you don't want to do that okay so now we're ready to pour our molds and now we're just going to pour our little mixture into the molds to make our little gummy bears and how many this makes really depends on how big your molds are these molds are great I could see myself making all kinds of little chocolate it's for Eric I can't eat chocolates but he sure can so this is going to make little hippos its gonna make little lions and it's gonna make a little bears and this one here is gonna make little hearts which are going to be great with a red so we're going to let these set up you just want to set them out room temperature for about thirty minutes they're gonna gel up and we're gonna have our very own homemade cinnamon gummy bears so it's been a little over half hour and we're gonna unmold our little bears here or our shapes so this is the silicone molds and look at how easy they come out these are the little hearts and we're just gonna pop them out just like that look at that isn't that adorable yeah we have gummy hearts I love this is a small one that I did with the leftover so you can make these as big or as small as you want here are some little bears oh that's a toot and here we have a little hippo and a little lion oh look they're so cute these molds are so easy nothing sticks to them they just pop right out these are a little sticky so you can put a little cornstarch on them if you want them it does make them like light like there's flour something on them but it will keep them from sticking but that's just a major of homemade gummy bears we will get our hearts out here are adorable we have our little hearts our little lions our little bears I love them they're so cute and you can you can really smell the cinnamon so let's try them we got cherry and cinnamon mmm all right taste this light gummy bear mmm salmon if you really want your cinnamon hot you could really crank that cinnamon up I think this is a really good blend of the cherry and the cinnamon try that mmm it's funny how they really gel up I mean this is Blaine jello it would just be Wiggly but that gelatine really they just get kind of hard not hard but not like jello Wow they're great so a little of your very own cinnamon gummy bear so easy to make and your kids will love them if you like this recipe please subscribe below and leave me a comment and a like and visit my website at a me learn to cook calm I'm also on Twitter and Pinterest at Amy learns to cook you must die", "qVwUhPEchho": "[Music] it's Thomas from frolic and I figured it's time for me to sit down with you and discuss a crisis that's going on we're in a lemon-peel crisis okay stores crack seed stores Long's Walmart anywhere you can find kind of crack seed they've been selling out of lemon peel and this is like the first time it's happened in forever but I feel like in the last six months eight months or so people have been going crazy for lemon peel gummies and so you know the origin of it is is a little muddy I heard it it comes from Hilo I also heard that it was probably started here on Oahu but whatever it is people are hooked on it like crack so we're gonna rank this it's a blind tasting I don't know any of the brands are that are here I've never seen the packages yet but we're gonna go through them and try some lemon peel gummies and see just one it's kind of light on the lemon peel but Asian off there where you can get the flavor of it lemon peel gummy beat there's a blue one but I want to try the red one oh so this one I've noticed the texture of the lemon peel is much finer so it's not as clumpy as the first first one mmm it's a totally different gummy it's very sweet compared to the first one that's especially on the level of the gum in the gummy I feel like the lemon peel doesn't come as through as strong as on the first one though lemon peel gummy sea hmm right off the bat it's very light on them in peel like almost non-existent I cannot taste it lemon peel gummy D Oh diva has a face this one is kind of light on the lemon peel - it's almost like a dusting mmm I don't know if I like that one I got cracker cuz we gotta cleanse the palate between gummy bears so I like the cracker where you got the cracker from okay lemon peel gummy e this one oh she is sticky okay this one this one is sticky so we know this one is a wet lemon peel Oh actually I got a double berry I got I got twins here so let's try the twins mm-hmm okay light it's light on the lemon peel favorite flavor but the sticky texture hmm okay I gotta know I get more of the lemon peel taste down this one's almost sour I think it could be the bears that are different but it's the the flavor of the bear kind of works with the lemon peel and it's this one's pretty good lemon peel gummy so this one what Oh what's a different one okay so I'm liking the coverage of the lemon peel on this like completely coats the bear the bear is much is actually smaller too I'm liking the taste of this one the best actually it's very it's very balanced compared to the others go let me lemon peel gummy bear G so last one in our taste test this one tastes like it's been marinating in the min peel for a long time it definitely has that the flavor runs throughout and the chunks are big on this one like I don't know the other ones not so much but like this one you can like definitely see that there's big pieces of lemon peel so if you like lemon peel this might be your one I think I think I think I know which how I'm gonna rank my first on my favorite one that I tasted is gonna be this one this is e F F okay let's see who made this one Oh son sunchang grocery where's that Kaneohe Oh China Town oh oh that's where you get the lemon peel from so that's why I probably tastes the best okay my second one was probably this last one that I tasted this one Oh Lonnie's Lani's okay this is this one was a special delivery - this one's from Hilo and apparently that's where Gump lemon peel gummies are from so if you know somebody in Hilo you know they can pick up Lonnie's for you and send them back but probably got to pay double okay the third one I liked was this one cuz a texture the texture was sticky and I think they use wet lemon peels so who is this one Oh family grocery Oh where's this one oh okay one windward side bear oh that's good okay that's different I like I said it didn't taste that one before most surprising because the ones I normally prefer are the dry but it was pretty good for a wet lemon peel and you know probably got to eat that one with toothpick or chopsticks because though the other ones are dry but that one is gonna stick to your fingers so gotta watch out yeah that's that's my top three [Music] you [Music]", "DADjyG9gOnE": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the black forest juicy bears they have juicy burst centers these are mixed fruit flavored gummy candies they were 250 at kroger and the sign on the display says that these are thick so it doesn't say that on the bag but it was on the display so they're in a resellable bag there are four flavors so that's that's everything in the bag so if you want to pick out four flavors um pick out red pink green punch uh what am i missing i don't know dark red light red i don't see a where is another light one is that a white one that looks exactly the same as that one maybe i'd need a dark red that's what i needed a dark red okay they say fat-free gluten-free colors from real sources eight pieces is 100 calories four fruity flavors we have cherry apple strawberry and pineapple these soft and delicious gummies are so juicy and so good that's because they have a delicious juicy burst center that's made with real fruit juice and colors from real sources they're also fat free and come in a variety of great fruity flavors so try our juicy gummies and delight in the magic of black forest these are manufactured by ferreira uh candy company in chicago yes they do so do you want to do uh uh cherry let's do strawberry i think it's gonna be the light one um a little liquid in there definitely strawberry it's more of a natural strawberry i love the texture of these they're very soft and a little chewy and if you wanted to you could make these last a while of course we're biting right into them because we want to try them for you but yeah these would be make great movie theater candy they will let's do the cherry except they're sticky good cherry flavor these do taste natural compared to like is it betty crocker that sells a lot of these like they'll sell trolls and yeah trolls and cars and all those i think that's betty crocker brand these do taste more natural you don't have fruit snacks or fruits fruit snacks yeah yeah i don't eat fruit snacks i don't know um these taste very very natural the ones you get in the little pockets yeah now i'm gonna go gummies and gummies these definitely taste more natural than a gummy yeah well oh yeah so i should be okay i see what you're saying so i should be comparing these to like albany okay and i'm thinking okay and i'm okay i'm literally thinking of fruit snacks okay well um because they do remind you of a fruit snack because they are so natural yes because they taste they taste more comparable to a fruit snack than they do to an all even the textures are very similar yeah yeah that's the truth then we have pineapple you really taste pineapple it's strong it's good flavor and again the textures are really good and they do give you enough of the liquid center to know that it's there yeah yeah it's not like full of liquid but there isn't there's a little touch of it this one's apple well i'm thinking like gushers that has the for the uh liquid in the middle the apple was okay that's probably my least favorite one awesome to me the flavor come at the very end yeah you got a little bit of apple yeah the apple you had to chew it for a minute and then you got it at the very end and like i said of course you could make these last for a while um i really really like these they're different than a gummy bear because the gummy bears is very chewy and almost rubbery these aren't like that these are more comparable to like a fruit snack they're they've got a little chew to them but they're hopefully they're softer so ultimately it's just a matter if you want a more candy flavor then you would want to buy like the albany yes but if you want a more natural flavor then you could buy this but they're good yeah i really do like these though i think kids will love them uh so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "ICsIQEuegck": "hey guys today i'm going to be doing a gummy bear review these are all benice they say world's best gummy bears there's 12 flavors of gummy bears in the bag and let's take them out and try them okay so i think i have one of each color here that's in the bag looks like the ones on the front and on the back side it says they are cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit lime blue raspberry and grape so let's see i had to take a guess this one probably cherry yep um that was good strawberry strawberry is very good not too sure which one would be mango i'm gonna guess it's gonna be one of these yellow ones nope that was a lemon that one was mango this one should be pineapple yes one of my favorites i had the lemon already so orange lemon and orange are my least favorite so far green apple that was pretty good watermelon i think that was watermelon [Music] no that was pink pink grapefruit that was pink grapefruit definitely pink grapefruit lime nope green apple that's one is watermelon you like green definitely blue raspberry and grape so my favorites were strawberry mango pineapple pink grapefruit and watermelon my least favorites were cherry straw i mean cherry lemon lime orange and grape the plain flavors but these gummy bears were so soft they're so soft some of the gummy bears like this is the pink grapefruit some of the gummy bears like the haribo they're sometimes they're too hard and chewy these are super gummy so is this world's best they might just be up for that [Applause] [Music] gummy bears this is a watermelon these are really good gummy bears if you have them in your store pick some up you won't regret it if you like gummy bears thanks for watching i better not eat too many of these even though they're fat free gluten free and low sodium they're still got sugar in them right so catch you on the next one peace", "hNCyCm73OrM": "or 20 things grow in Ontario bad cancer with another gummy recipe guys I just wanted to get some clarification at the last video I showed a very detailed step-by-step was quite a long video I'll put a link to the video up here maybe appear somewhere up in the top somewhere here there'll be a link okay and then that you're gonna see the step-by-step on how to do it okay this is gonna be a quick and dirty one okay so what you got here is four boxes of jell-o these four boxes are the 85 down the small box four boxes okay in those four boxes I am then what we have is for every one box of those I have three packs of these okay or about that much in a shot glass not much okay just a little bit try one of those for every box so there is four of these in this container right here okay okay you have one cup of cannabis infused coconut oil mm-hmm and two cups I won't move it cuz it's pretty full two cups of water alright so what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna put this on pause we're going to come back and we're gonna do this quick and show you the steps and with which order I put them in alright so what you have here is 2 cups of water and 1 cup of already liquefied cannabis infused coconut oil add it in at medium to low heat and stir until it's consistently mixed alright so now that it's thoroughly mixed here and it's up to temperature what you're gonna want to do is going to add your twelve packs of unflavored gelatin right and you want to mix it in slowly to not make any clumps I'm gonna keep call of that once it's all in alright so now that the gelatin is nice and mixed in now I'm gonna add the four boxes of flavor gelatin it's cause I'm using blue berry berry blue but anyways that's it now mix thoroughly once mixed early I'll be back to fill your next step now that it's thoroughly mixed I'm going to increase the heat probably two notches on my stove okay what he's gonna do is gonna bring it to somewhat a while right back all right I've been stirring this whole time as I brought up the temperature and as you can see start in the bubble okay this is what you want you want to get a little bit more than this started a little bubble too much so I have to do is turn down the heat a little bit just pull it off all I can hear I don't want it to get too hot because what it'll do is it'll burn the sugar and stuff in here right stick to the bottom of the pan definitely I wanna do that so I backed it off one notch that's good so now it's blowing at this level and they keep stirring so it doesn't burn and what I'm gonna do is on the set of timer for five minutes protip you want to bring the stuff from the outside edge in see how I'm bringing that stuff in the color changes you want to make sure you're getting it nice and evenly stirred as you're doing this you can see the steam coming off I don't know you can see in the video but as you're doing it and your stove and your kitchen you're going to see the steam coming off that's why I do it for five minutes I'd boil off some of that water okay so if you want to do it for less than five minutes you're gonna have more material the less gummy stuff right so the more water you boil off a thicker it's going to get next step once this comes to a boil or once you're done your boiling off and you're ready to go then pour this into something you can pour into your molds I use the old glass or glittering top there and I go right into that it's easy to get out of that piece to put in all right there we go five minutes Rock turn that off right right off the stove turn that off and right into my measuring cup okay now what you're going to want to do is you want to get every little bit off and then what you're going to do is you want to take note of how much gelatin you have in your measuring cup so then you know hey this is this time when I boil it off for five minutes it turns in to be about X amount of company pay so for me that right there is three and a half cups of gelatin that's what it turned out to be okay guys so then into the mold in the way you go you'll want to do this fast because it's starting to harden already into your molds into the freezer and then take out and enjoy and there we go so these have been in the freezer for about a half an hour so now we can just kind of pop these out and enjoy so you'll see a Lincoln in in my in the description okay these these jello Lego blocks are are great for dosing right you can take four blocks I can take two blocks that can take six blocks or I can take all eight right so it's easier to dose when you have something like that okay you get these on Amazon and like I said there'll be a link in the description some of these other ones I've just bought locally at bulk Mart or whatever so but that's that's that's the start to finish guys so very quick recipe all the ingredients were at the start and you're good to go sometimes too when you get these Lego blocks I usually do a little bit of Pam spray in here cuz these little ones sometimes they get in here like these little itsy bitsy ones they get stuck in there so I just give them a little bit of Pam spray comes right out perfect these ones you don't need to they're a little bit sticky but they come out one piece right that's it so if you like my video give us a little thumbs up there subscribe do all that jazz got more stuff coming guys so be on the lookout", "0X5fqRx_ppc": "hey guys and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "QovKXCWfXpY": "mine's gonna just try the jello part that doesn't have a sugar better welcome to ryan toysreview yeah so Ryan's favorite color is green so we decided to make green gummies so we're gonna use a hundred and eight of these jello packets and yeah yeah and 20 of these unflavored Lots packet because we want to make gummies so they have to be pretty hard [Music] [Applause] that's how much we can have left to go we're slowly finishing the packets look how much powder we use it almost fill up and I guess we have to use all of this because we wanted super hard gummies right now we're going to add in some warm hot water [Music] now we have to stir it together [Music] Wow so this is super hot so only an adult can do it [Music] and so you got all these residue left over here that we have to just throw away because it will not dissolve it just looks like it's still watering let's see if we can take it out on you joining us is mr any case number last time I ate that gel here I think so huh let's see it's gonna work that means it like yeah [Music] [Music] we can take it out and put it on oh these are hard like nothing but sugar probably very well there's

fun [Music] you", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "HEMxJl7_cEA": "[Music] welcome back to unwrapped i'm mark summers sorting through lots of halloween treats how about gummies they're a standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "KvktkCIRjMI": "[Music] hello we're back so today we're making edible slime with gummy bears that's right it's a two ingredients line all your needs is gummy bears and powdered sugar and don't forget you need a bowl and mixer to mix it in before we get started on four subscribe and hit that little bell in the corner so you're in our notification squad - guys let's get started because we've never made a sponge for so we asked first time and so we divided bowls or packs into four colors and so I took two colors he just two colors and where I see what color it makes you know the first program let's start - gummy bears together in one Bowl get a Malo I'm already there I'm excited to eat it because I

say we need 10 more seconds mine looks really cute annex most super good digits on cubby bear's yeah I can't wait to eat this so this is mine oh my gosh it looks like the grain on this smooth so good oh and if there are picky I think we should start putting some sugar in because so we're on experiment instead of putting it on here and then moving it because it's a little hot right now I thought since it'll be a little bit core we could put that helmet in and sprinkle it in and mix it and they get a little bit cooler and give it a nice cool down so it's really really good like mine smells amazing my school off this is not supposed to make it what's to make it not sticky so nothing bad is in here that will poison you it's not glue it's just gummy bears so for this line you can eat it and play yeah you can play too so this white is um helping my drum pink like I wanted it to - tiny more like darker green like my room we have to keep the room toward I'm going to go and then we'll be up there I put a lot in the beginning so it's out sticking as much at her so yeah I said more in Milan I put a lot in so that's how Marie is doing she's cool no it's good so my gosh look at that now yours in the end funnier or not finance like more my gosh we go over there I'm strong bold oh god if red tell you so I was playing my sign I was playing with it I dropped in with love it didn't come off but I forgot I have washable glue I suggest using washable glue because they did come off it eventually did come off when I put it in the washing machine so use na washable glue wash roses yes you did very very helpful so we're going to take the powder and put it on the paper and I'll put it the slime all in the paper so our 3d sticky bar let's see I think can't get underneath so a little bit hot but it's not hot enough hold of our non-sports gonna wait so - why do that I finally got it though I mean it's so sticky but extending a messy very messy so I would have to do with your parents

plane I'll cut to the chase by saying that once I got boarded on my flight to Florida I started to get a little hungry no big deal I thought since I have some sugarless gummy bears to eat I know it sounds gross but I'm hungry trying to eat healthier well once I opened the one pound bag of them immediately the teenager next to me asked if he could have some I didn't care because I talked to him once we were boarded and he seemed pretty chill plus that bag was one pound and there was no way I was going to do it by myself we are going to town on this bag because they aren't that bad actually I'm sitting in the window seat and this kid is sitting next to me in the aisle seat and across the aisle is his little brother less than two years old if I had to guess and his mother next to him in the window seat across the plane the toddler is getting all curious so that the teen next to me begins to tear the Bears in little pieces to let him have some again I didn't really care because the whole family was pretty chill by now all three of us are eating some and the bag is running low the teen showed no signs of stopping so I just has if he wanted the rest he agrees and takes it while I tried to get some shut-eye the teen follow suit and asks his mom if she wants to keep tearing the little bears up to feed to the garbage disposal of a toddler the mom starts snacking on them while simultaneously feeding the tunneler some I didn't think much of it because I started to actually fall asleep I woke up with the worst feeling in my stomach not 30 minutes later I take the small blanket I had off over my face and all three of the family members are nowhere to be seen at this point they could have fallen out of the duct and plane and I wouldn't have cared because my stomach was feeling like it was hitting the abort button like I was having them gurgles I get up and make my way to the bathroom at the front of the plane and I spot the team that was sitting next to me banging on the door actually ducking crying I start to put two and two together that it might be the gummy bears since we all ate some well after banging on the door the mom and toddler fine we come out in a rush with the mother looking like she just served in Vietnam she's sweating like crazy and starts asking me what the duck I put in those gummies I told her straight up that I had no idea what is going on because I had just bought the bag and didn't do anything to it the absolute second I finished my sentence the baby shoots liquid diarrhea out of its ass like it was being paid to do it I can't Handl  and some of it even got on my forearm so I started to puke mid projectile vomit the team comes out sweating bullets and I rush in there I sit on the toilet and enter orbit when my ass opened I swear I lifted off the ducking seat while simultaneously blowing chunks in the piss station to the right of the toilet once I'm done throwing up I can hear the complete chaos unfolding outside the door the toddler is hysterical the mom is shouting and the stewardess is trying to calm everyone down I clean up as much as I could in step out of the bathroom and as soon as I did the most putrid smell hit my nose I assess the damage done by the Hershey squirting baby and it was a lot worse than I thought not only did the baby manage to out of its onesie and onto my forearm but also all over the seats in the first row thank God no one was sitting there as I make my way back to my seat not wanting to look the covered mother in the face I noticed the baby also left a trail of turds all along the aisle leading to her seat I got back to my seat and everyone is looking at me like I opened fire on a bag of newborn puppies I apologized more than I have ever in my life and explained that I didn't know that gummy bears could do that the plane made an emergency landing and everyone got off the plane because the smell was too much I went to the airport bathroom to freshen

he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty and there you have it some infuse gummies thank you guys for watching make sure you like subscribe to my channel bye", "1pyKvaRv_kI": "hello everyone thanks for watching so last night we decided to try and soak gummy bears in one bowl with vodka and one ball was Everclear it's game day college football here at MSU in Montana and so we thought it would be kind of fun to take alcohol-soaked gummy bears with us just for a treat and what we discovered was when you feel the gummy bears with vodka overnight the gummy bears absorb all of the vodka and so those are usually how we've been known to have them in the past but we got Everclear you know like put the jello shots Everclear quite a bit more alcohol that maybe we would try to soak some and Everclear and unfortunately it doesn't work so the gummy bears are still hard they haven't absorbed any of the liquid and it's just really a mess nothing has been absorbed so this was our experiment if you want to make vodka soaked gummy bears they're delicious and you just soak them overnight or for a few hours before game time and they're wonderful the Everclear ones do not work it could possibly beat it it's 190 proof instead of 80 proof and I have no idea what kind of chemical reaction has now happened I don't know if we should rinse them off and try soaking those in vodka as well to see what happens we might do that but completely different completely different outcome so my recommendation to you is for game day suck your gummy bears and vodka it's delicious thanks for watching have a beautiful day you", "vsimevsmJgo": "[Music] hey so i have been on amazon reading all the horrible sugar-free gummy bear reviews and i'm highly concerned i mean there is some gastronomical crap going on and i'm wondering is it all a hoax or does crap get real bad when you eat those cute little things in the name of science i'm gonna sacrifice my inners for us to find out is this real or is it like i have gone to two gas stations one grocery store and one pharmacy and none of them have the sugar-free gummy bears right there that to me is a bunch of red flags that you should not be eating these i decided to call the cvs that's 20 minutes away and confirm if they have those and they do and now i'm here all in the name of science y'all i'm gonna go get those gut rotters am i nervous i am actually i'm really nervous i'm afraid that my

snuggling here with my daughter although i don't know if she really wants to be snuggling with me at this point i took a bath and i have went from a size 6 to probably a size 12 with bloating my stomach literally had a gas ball in it that looked like i was pregnant with a baby doing this with its elbow i saw that i saw that with my own eyes i am not feeling good right now what i have done is

with gobbling down those horrible sweet concoctions in closing the only people that should be fed these are people on death row biz niches and my exes in conclusion that is all", "MKXi_Qi3pCk": "hey guys welcome to this facility today's experiment will be gummy bear expansion for this experiment you'll need a popular gummy bears a cup full of water and a ball so first you get four gummy bears two of each color now we get the water and pour it into the bowl then yeah gummy bear one type and the gummy bear of the other side and just put it there and then you put a gummy bear on each side to compare the size of the gummy bear it's an otter now we used two types of gummy bears to ensure to repeat the test to ensure for Ella reliable results and the gummy bears outside the water will be a control so we can compare their initial size for their size after a long while in the water so guys we left the gummy bears in the water for about fourteen and a half hours overnight and now I'll get some tweezers and so here we have the control ones to compare size and we're going to take out the big ones with some tweezers very carefully so that we don't break them put it down and there we go there we go now the gummy bears have grown in size because of a process called osmosis basically the concentration of water inside the gummy bear was much lower than the concentration of water outside the gummy bear because of the glucose inside the gummy bear and the gummy bear has a partially permeable membrane on the outside which lets water go in and that's water basically diffuse into the gummy bear to make sure that the water concentrations are the same book inside and outside the current bear thus making the gummy burger own size now the reason why the gummy Britain essentially explode was because the partially permeable membrane is also a boundary and is a very strong boundary so it doesn't let the gummy bear itself break so for this experiment we recommend using harrybo gummy bears as we tested with another brand and it didn't really work it's just the gummy bear split in the water and it's all very nice but I think these colors are still edible and like you can just get a small pack of them and put them in water and you get much bigger gummy bears so we hope you like this video like subscribe comment below what you want us to do tell us how you did it maybe who try it tell us what you think about it and thanks for watching", "fphz28eKVCo": " - Gummy animals\n don't grow on trees,  they grow here at my\n gummy animal farm.

It's such a lovely place, I\n think most of these creatures   have no idea that the main\n  point of their existence   is to be killed so\n  we can eat them.  The gummy bears are\n my favorite to breed  because you never know\n what color you're gonna get and they can't kill\nyou like regular bears.  Gummy bears are unique\n in the bear family  in that the females\n grow to full size,   whereas the males\n  stay bite size.  This can intimidate the males,   so we need to help\n  them a little bit.  Once the mamma bears\n are ready to pop,  I'm right there ready\n to catch them babies   and get them ready\n  for consumption.  Now, there are a few\n ways to slaughter.

bears that is right this is the perfect gift I did for your father so let's go spice things up so the first thing you'll want to do is pick out their favorite beer so this is a coffee stout that I just picked up from Costco you can find it in your beer section or I'll try to find it and we get below but this is the kind we are going with today but really you can pick whatever beer you want so to a bowl we are gonna add one cup of beer whatever choice you want of course alright so now you will want to add 1/2 a cup of sugar I am using a ultrafine sugar a lot of times you find this in making cocktails you can use regular sugar if you want but for me I find it dissolves better and lastly you'll want 3 packets of unflavored gelatin or 3 tablespoons now go ahead and whisk it all together alright so now I'm just putting it in the microwave and I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and then stir it and then a minute again alright so it's been a total of two minutes and the gelatin and the sugar has dissolved together and if you want to avoid all this foam all you do is have to have it not carbonated so if you want to take the lid off right away but it really doesn't make a difference you'll just have to make sure to get underneath the foam or sit it out a little bit okay so right here I have gummy bear molds and then I have this and then I have this dropper so I'm just gonna go underneath the foam and get the mixture and just pour them individually in each gummy mold and you'll just want to do that until they are all filled now if you're wondering what to do if you don't have gummy bear molds use any mold will do these are pineapples and also if who you're making this for does not like alcohol you can always switch instead of beer you could do root beer and then of course I have these on a pan so it's easier to move the silicone molds and then the last thing I'm going to do is put these in the fridge for two hours so we'll come back after two hours when they have formed hey spices don't forget to like and share this video and after two hours the gelatin has formed into these gummies would you like to see what it looks like alright so this is a little pineapple this is the grape and the little gummy bears yep he's definitely smell like beer but tastes like candy your father will love this Do It Yourself gift idea well thank you guys so much for watching and if you'd like to see any more videos click this link or this link if you like to subscribe click my face and I remember I'm always here to help you make beautiful memories through food

[Music]", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "hOnV1X7ulRQ": "you're going on a bear hunt goodbye Haribo we can make literally anything you want out of gummy bears ice cream a picture chocolate and even a

resolution just because some people give up doesn't mean that everybody does I relate big time I was that guy that was like scared to go to the gym and work out because I was worried about other people making fun of me or what other people thought and slightly don't be a dick it's pretty simple don't be a dick why are you gonna make gummy bears more often now that's made out of T in its wheat without it being real sugar they're not done yet but they're definitely better consistency their money they're so Megan's gonna start making gummy bears apparently and they're like healthy gummy bears so she bought a whole bunch of these little little trays little gummy bear trays water we can start making like we could start making acid ones and sell them oh yeah we could make G field one soup of course but we can start making acid ones or likes somewhat sluicin Ingenix in it and start selling them no Jesus Christ so I've gone over some my goals for the year what I want to achieve in 2019 major ones are the losing 50 pounds hitting the goal of 200 the daily objective is managing my day better financially getting out of debt and just you know progressing as a person and mentally and physically progressing you know that the health was continuing eating better that's one thing I really do feel like 2018 that I did progress actually really well was eating a lot better I really moved into the keto and paleo lifestyle and I didn't do it in the sense of just trying to achieve weight loss route you know actually trying to just feel better just I don't know get more out of my food you know they may just get more out of what I consume on a daily basis so I figured one thing that would be cool is just to kind of see what you guys want to do this year what do you guys want achieve this year what kind of resolution do you guys want to set forward in 2019 what do you want to change about yourself this year what could you say in the comments or on Twitter or an Instagram in

comments down below what are you guys's goals and ambitions this year you know don't be shy don't feel that your goal is any less than somebody else's because it's like not a weight loss or a money goal like what do you guys want to get done this year I know a monthly goal right now my objectives in the first month of the year cuz I do want to start breaking down things a lot more is when I get

YouTube videos if you want to start designing if you want to start working out through what other people think even if they are making fun of you or we're not supporting you in some way realistically I can just tell you from experience that in a lot of situations most people out there just don't care like I said we are our own worst enemy when I first started going to the gym I was really nervous as I was afraid of how people would start looking at me you know cuz I'm overweight I'm in I don't really know what I'm doing it I super realize like nobody cares like nobody gives a [ __ ] they're

done maybe actually get a setup video going it's all got for you guys today I'm out peace [Music] [Laughter] [Music]", "mabfxc09iq8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'll be sharing the super easy recipe and this seems to be the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys

basically this one bottle contains a month supply that are 30 gummy bears you're supposed to take one each day to them and then swallow these so i did not have any specific medical condition before consuming these and i didn't have any deficiency so if you are going to consume these for that i can't really say how it's going to work out but my honest review um didn't drastically change anything

Sun is just starting to come up we are fishing out here in a local lake for largemouth bass ever neighbor Rick with us today and of course out here with my dad we are on the boat we are largemouth fishing and this is the very first gummy worm fishing challenge ever check out the bait lineup we have horrible part about I say snakes we are using nothing but gummy worms in this morning it is summertime so it gets very hot we're only in a fish probably till about 11:00 or so look these are stuck together you know I'm actually gonna leave them stuck together okay that's just the way they come they literally they come to snakes oh I just put bones okay well they come to snakes stuck together do you want to use them yes archers that's actually a perfect color and then we have here this is I've never seen this is called the all-star mix trolley they have little people I guess we'll get to that in a second that's kind of a weird color we have octopus check out that that is gonna come in fact I'm gonna set that guy that is a special one we're gonna set that onto the site we have let's see where's a long I know we have llamas name there we go we got a llama Roland a llama might come into play and the other one I'm most confident about out of all of them simply because we've caught trout I've never caught a bass on the gummy new Breton lure but we have caught trout on these before and this is actually what I'll start off with is a nice a little gummy worm their first ever gummy fishing challenge so I'm just gonna rig this gummy worm just like you would any other plastic bait just Texas rig got a paid one eight ounce sinker well fishing pretty shallow water you don't need a lot of weight paint sinker and there you go guys and so we have a Texas rig gummy worm right there black forced everyone let's see how this works guys I got one I got one on a gummy worm yes on a gummy worm Oh literally it's huge - look at that it's huge it's huge it's a tank are you kidding me look at you grab it don't worry about that don't worry about that just oh my goodness no look the gummy worm fell off must have fallen off in the fight it's not it's kind of brittle holy heck that's like the biggest large oh they cut all year on this lake is crazy guys like the second cast of the day big budget guys unfortunately our scale or our yeah our scale is not it's out the batteries aren't working but this isn't almost 20 inch largemouth good grief this is probably solid 4 pounder probably yeah the Willie go-go board hasn't put it over 4 pounds that is a my biggest this is guys this is the biggest bass of the year for me right here on a gummy where that is crazy the second it was either the second or third cast of the day my biggest pass of the year on a gummy worm I thought at the start of this day if I catch one fish something gummy I'll be super happy and so that's just that's amazing so I'm not taking anything for granted let's see if we can get another fish on this you know guys I had planned on using some of these octopus and stuff next and I will I want to see if I can get another one I'm just the regular gummy worm red and green there we go let's give it a go these octopus and llamas and snakes they'll come into play later oh you had one fallen oh my dad just had one follow up on his uh his gummy this is funny here have been wasting money on five dollar packs of baits and I could have been I could have in a dollar bag of gummy worms yeah they'd be fighting as a fishin troll tournament with nothing but gommi guys I'm gonna switch up to an orange and yellow one they kind of come off the hook easily so we might go through this bag pretty fast like that so maybe it's like something unusual they've never seen and it smells different than anything they've ever seen and so who knows and I'm not trying to jinx the day just cuz we caught one but we'll see if we catch more but that's another theory and all the parties I think it came up just all right guys check it out I'm switching to a little you know I'm it makes the kind of Carolina rig a little bit this octopus see if we catch someone and gummy octopus let's see if the llama turns things around not even hook a llama and hook the llama through the foot and then put the hook point in his head there we go that'll be good action in the water oh I missed him I did on the llama that was he started take off with it dang it grabbed the llama pulled him off almost pulled him off the hook they call this one Cusco my dad has a tough morning efficient besides it's been good for me but with my gummy worms I wouldn't say that turned our day around no no but it got the money got the monkey off my back a little larger ah nice got one annika me where he snagged he snagged though oh my line is tangled I was wondering what was I can still feel him on there he's still on look there you serious oh that was that was crazy got snagged I thought here's what I think so these baths are just used to eating protein all day and they see that little sweet snack I know they've never seen anything like it before Wow guys ii gummy worm a fish ever another another like solid I've switched back to like I'll show you guys what I switch to they caught this one on a different I've been trying just like every gummy worm in the pack that one on the Black Forest ones but this time it was an orange and yellow gummy worm I've been throwing everything dinosaurs everything we got snakes and this is tell you what maybe it's a finessed and I'd say maybe the sugars coming off of that thing because it's kind of melting in this warm water each worm only lasts about 5 or 10 minutes but maybe that's the key to it at 2:00 today well guys I'm happy that I caught - I can't believe they cut - do you did on gummy worms but the gummy worms as you can see you're starting to just fall apart fall off the hook the fish bone apart easily well guys if you enjoyed this video preached plus the like on it and we'll do another gummy worm challenge and it differently hopefully on a day when it a little bit better then you guys so much for watching I'll see you guys the next one [Music] [Music]",

special cheese and thank you my new subscribers thank you thank you just scared girl love you", "hpXTc5Zwj98": "hi welcome to Katie's playtime thank you to all my subscribers for asking me to make gummy bears and yes I do have a video already uploaded about how to make gummy bears using gelatin but in this video I'm going to do something different something where some people out there sitting at home don't like gelatin in their food so I've come up with a different recipe I've come up with a vegan vegetarian recipe on making your own gummy bears so for all the families out there I hope this is the winner for you and if this doesn't interest you I do have another video with gelatin so let's get started so the first thing you need to make sure you have is your glucose syrup so that's it that's the replacement for corn syrup so either glucose or corn syrup you also need some water you need some fruit juice you need some citrus pectin which is um you can actually get that from the health foods section in your supermarket or from any health food store and it is actually made in Mexico so for anyone over in America at the moment and you'll be able to find it I'm sure you also need some pink food coloring and over here you need some agar agar now agar agar is going to replace our gelatin fruit our citrus fruit pectin is actually going to replace our jelly so we also need some citrus acid citric acid if you're going to roll it in to make a sour type of lollies and some castor sugar and I've just got some icing sugar in a bowl here ready for when I roll them to make them just nice and plain we also need our sauce spoon a spoon make sure it's wooden or plastic because if it's a metal one it will heat up all the ingredients too quickly and also we can't forget our silicon molds so let's get started so the first thing you need is 1/2 a cup of water and place that in your saucepan you also then need 1/4 of a cup of glucose syrup and it's really really thick and gluggy so just be careful and take your time and then just give it a nice mix you need to mix us so both ingredients are nice and smooth together so our next step is to put our gelatin replacement in and that's going to be our agar agar now you can get that from your health food section in the supermarket or your health food store and it's gluten free its fructose free dairy free nut free and lactose free so anybody out there that's suffering from any of those this is the alternative to still make gummies and still have fun so in a normal recipe where it says how much gelatin you need just convert it into the same amount in agar agar so in my previous video it was two tablespoons of gelatin so I'm going to use two tablespoons of agar agar and we're going to mix that in and make sure there's no lumps okay so once you've mixed it and it's all nice and clear we're now going to put our jelly replacement in now what we want to do is we want to put one cup of our fruit juice so I'm just going to use my half a cup and I'm going to do two halves to make a one cup so I've got one half and then my other half to make one and in jelly it also does have gelatin in jelly so with this I'm going to use citrus pectin and what that is is that's gluten free as well dairy free it's soy free and it's lactose free and it's not free so all we're going to do is use three and a half teaspoons of this so it's a bit thick so we're going to add one and a half cups of water and now put three cups of sugar our last thing we need to put in is a food coloring so I've chosen the pink okay so now all of my ingredients are mixed together let's go over to the stove and heat it up and fingers crossed away so turning on the gas stove and just move it down to more of the lower heat and place our mix on and just keep stirring so keep stirring it until it goes nice and clear and it goes nice and like sticky if that makes any sense and once it cooks to that part then it's ready to put in our molds so come with me and let's start putting it in and so just using two teaspoons just carefully place it the mixture into your molds I'm using silicon molds just because it is easier to and take the gummies out afterwards so now I've put my molds in the fridge for half an hour and then in half an ounce time we'll see what we've got fingers cars yeah okay so our gummies are already they're out of the fridge so they're ready to be demolded and we'll see what we have got oh wow that looks great and so yes they are sticky like my other video so I've got my sugar my icing sugar and my citric acid here on plates and so that's just going to give me different flavors okay so there you have it I've got vegan vegetarian lactose-free gluten-free gummy lollies which I would probably say has a little bit of a jelly texture to them and they're not as chewy as your gummy so I suppose I now I have to do the taste tester so here we go let's just do a plain one mmm yeah definitely a jelly type of line really good now I've got the plain one to do so that's just plain no coating mmm and you can see inside is very jelly like absolutely amazing I know you're waiting for to see my face with the sour one I'll be ready I really travel that really jesu at the same time so thank you to all my subscribers that has asked me to do gummy lollies I have given you two videos because I just love you all so much enjoy I hope you enjoy making these at home be safe don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in my next video", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "YlzkjcxX3EY": "Lala yeah I class I and karzai oh oh hi Oh dad that's what he wants oh I know I thought oh god car yet okay clean it I thought oh yeah sit

Amazon it's it's 5 pounds it's just 5 pounds of gummy bears now let me put this into perspective the sugary version of these is like 9 bucks mm-hmm less than 10 bucks I was gonna guess ten dollars so I'll say a little bit more maybe it's fancier 15 $100 one well you just gave it away $100 I was gonna be like higher lower like you no no okay no I'm holding a Benjamin yeah yeah and that $100 it's heavier and the reason why a cinderblock it's because the reviews are so funny that the item went viral now should we eat some of these while you're telling me yeah yeah um is this kind of like the cookbook have you seen microwaving four-one-oh no but I should look into that there's a cookbook called microwaving for one and Elizabeth little lady wind microwaves were first came out they're really popular oh it's not a joke it's kind of sad because I think she lost her spouse and now she's microwaving for one so it's kind of depressing but it became like really popular on reddit and this book that was like five dollars is now more expensive because it's kind of this microwaving oh  I own it okay see while you're chewing on this just to have one just just one drop what's all the rage about David just hold on to that other one don't eat it you the title of david's review is fully weaponized gummi bears I bought it back because I'm trying to cut down on sugar it seemed Haribo has replaced the sucrose and a typical batch of gummy bears with : shredding rage just a couple of handfuls left me crying for my mommy on the bathroom floor parenthesis I am 43 years old what well you won't eat that other one here's one by a little nervous here's one by Sims here is only one way to say it it's by one way there's only one way to say it I sneezed out of my buttonhole I want Rosana to read these okay can we let her reading of course um-hmm um-hmm right here oh this is continued yeah let it read that wrong it'd be like a bedtime story for my lower GI tract oh here we go when the rumbling started I sprinted down the hallway and made it to the bathroom just in time for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to stampede from my backside laying waste to my home septic system and my will to live oh you want an island here already so I read some here they go why don't how many of you want ranks I've eaten too how many of you eaten - I don't know if I should do anymore based on these reviews they don't taste that bad but I'm really getting nervous every anything with sugar alcohol in it you know like uh like if you do like the low carb diet like my wife went to this thing where she was getting like the Atkins bars oh gosh and they have sugar alcohol in it which is a sweetener that you know is it's not sugar it's not sugar mm-hmm but it can have a horrible effect on your bow case-in-point Christopher gray his post is entitled space-time continuum I have observed an interesting phenomenon when I eat these I am temporarily granted the power to poop things I didn't actually eat here's one from Greg be a fight I do not bring to sporting event other than the war that the bottom half of my body is currently having with this porcelain chair it is as quiet as a pin drop in this public restroom I call out does anyone have a diaper hoping that some gentleman was changing a baby nothing no one said a word I know people are in here I can see the toes of shoes pointed in my direction under the stall does anyone have a diaper I am screaming my son is now crying he thinks he is witnessing the death of his father I can't even assure him that I will make it and let's see yes he is like really good writing yeah I think in their little sensational they get sensational but people actually experience this stuff um this ruined my life from gummy poo um I see is that the beginning of this cuz we kind of wrote this up in a weird way it is and this is not the entire thing this is just an excerpt of his right without gummy poo from gummy poo with no other option I ran back towards the bathroom trying to keep my cheeks clenched little staccato bursts of sulfuric farts punctuated each yard as I raced for the finish line hoping that I could keep my chocolate starfish clenched tight enough to steal the donuts that's too much information I mean you've nicknamed it I ripped it really I ripped the door open and somehow managed to drop my pants without undoing my belt whatever that sounded like a steamroller driving through a bubble wrap you know what we should study these it's true does anybody want any uh you know what I uh I hate to a handful no don't yeah we're not gonna document okay alright you want to read a couple more I have here no if it gets any worse than that I just feel like I thought about my car and how I complete an unforgiving fire would be the only way to cleanse it gonna burn himself his car he's gonna burn his car okay well would we learn a day till my wife I loved her Haribo I hold no ill will I blame no one I have even forgiven myself is there a Gibson for giving myself okay I think we've learned that I am so sorry mrs. teacher's name I was never asked to send snacks to my daughter's class again oh I do want to find out where did you get those cupcakes from place on Magnolia so Magnolia I like him so much really sugar free sugar free cupcake I'm going I like those those are good um so ro uh we ate a lot of stuff on your channel too but I don't know that you expected us to eat everything at every point in the process of making the recipe but you dealt with it pretty well yeah um I couldn't help but notice that you weren't eating any of like the cake batter the cake batter or this when we do test baking we'd test bake in like different sections and the day before I usually eat about 4 to 5 cupcakes so I try to control it quality control cuz I have a sweet tooth so right right I go crazy about once a week during the test baking and then I try to control it there were the rest of the week but do you like um like I was I was telling you I have a weakness for cake batter or anything that's like raw sweets or like undercooked like cookie dough cookie batter brownie batter like once you bake that stuff I I could care less I'd rather have a rib and that's a disorder it yeah I'd rather have meat and man if you go to cook that batter you might as well just give me meat I like them both I like steaks and I like sweet so I don't do that you don't Duras I do I like cookie cake better not as much as cookie dough cookie dough's my favorite cookie dough ice cream gets me in trouble I can't be around it or I'll eat all of it I went to the farmers market here in Los Angeles mm-hmm and they were there was a guy selling cake batter in cups and cookie dough in cups and all the raw stuff but he made them without eggs so no one would die so no one would die that's cool but technically was social you're not gonna get Salmonella from we've been through this raw eggs in America you can eat all the raw eggs you want just like rocky drink them for breakfast yeah mm-hmm yeah I know people who do sampled eggs every morning but those are cooked what those are good this isn't really relatable but I just like I mean maybe there's a part of it that's under coach they don't have to because I do sunny side up what's your favorite dessert like if you had only one dessert the rest of your life having made so many stuffs my current favorite sure macaroons was all fancy French cookies delicious how many ones that are kind of I don't get better I don't get them they're kind of crispy mm-hmm they're like soft and fluffy on the area hide crispy on the outside they come in different flavors but my sweet tooth changes a lot because I do eat a lot of sweets I also love donuts maple donuts maple bars okay you should put pork rinds on one going seriously hot news flash I'm I'm experiencing a symptom right now but centum of what well in the back of my throat like the flap between the top of my throat and

from the miami-dade Police Department tonight CBS 4s Gaby Fleischman has more on how to spot the drugs and its side effects what looks like a sweet snack is now being used to disguise a dangerous drug designed to appeal to kids these dangerous chemicals are out there in rather benign seeming forms and we all need to be careful during the narcotics bust miami-dade police say they found what looks like candy in a ziplock bag turns out it was laced with a synthetic drug similar to Flocka and bath salts it's a crystal like drug that's cheap addictive and deadly it can be swallowed smoked or injected and often causes hallucinations and paranoia there's been a lot of medical problems from the consumption of these products in this case narcotics detectives say the drug mimic to the candies sugar coating it looked almost identical to regular gummies but they were stickier and individually wrapped the crystalline form was crushed up and a piece of candy was rolled in the crystals to make the illegal substances attractive and marketable this is miami-dade County's first case the Flocka has become a growing problem in South Florida in Fort Lauderdale a man on Franco was impaled on a fence while trying to break into the police department one month earlier a person high on the drugs thought he was being chased and tried to break through the police department's impact resistant doors then there's the man caught on video running naked down Broward Boulevard cops say he admitted he was high on Flocka it's only the cat and mouse game police say new drugs are constantly being created to avoid arrest and target kids and they want parents to know what's out there before it becomes a serious problem and these are all things that we want to make sure that we see we see it out on the street or we see something of that nature make sure that we stay away from it and it's extremely difficult to tell the difference between the drug laced candy and the actual candy so police say the best thing you can do as a parent is to keep an eye on your kids see if they have any changes in behavior and get them help if necessary from miami-dade police headquarters Gaby Fleischman cbs4 news", "lubrPyIVZaw": "what's up guys get off I'm gonna be slower I don't know guys exercise the first time doing this song if we're having some technical difficulties I do apologize we're gonna try to go through this gummy bear keto gummy bear cook along and do it as a live if you guys have any tips or suggestions about doing lines let me know this is the first one I've ever done and I don't really have a whole lot of information about it I just kind of jumped in hey what's up we got a first person in here how's it going alright so Lindsay's making some coffee because she's kind of tired been a long day we've been ripping and running all day long but we are getting ready to do this keto gummy bear cook along I'm just waiting for some people to get in here so go ahead and comment and let me know where you guys are where you guys are from and I'll shot it back up out actually you guys can go get these from Amazon they're just like silicone molds what were they called in the package you know so just get on Amazon and search gummy bear and what and they come with these little droppers so once we get done we'll show you how they work and these are going to be our molds for the gummy bears these are the ones that the actual bears but we got like an assorted cat that came with all kinds of different ones all right I think it's just what water for liquid and your sugar free jello from the store I go with the jello brand because it's the it's like zero carb I don't know why guys but a lot of times when you go with the store brand like the cheap brand there's usually carbs in there but if you get the name brand there's not usually any carp in it so sugar-free jell-o is whatever flavors that you would like and then some of this gelatin powder you're going to need as well and I think it's just water right just loosely thing okay just water the gelatin and the jello packets it comes with these drops like I was telling you before and once we make our little jello we're gonna suck it up through in here and then form into the moles let them cool off and we're gonna have some keto gummy bears they're pretty good actually I mean well ten calories in a box we were cooking dinner and they ate like a whole bunch before dinner and they said it made him feel full cuz obviously it's a jello but hey what's going on wait why did it say message reject it Oh retracted so anyways we're just gonna try to get some people in here and like I said just comment where you're from and then we'll start to go ahead and cook these things that they don't take very long at all by the way guys it's like we're doing like ten boxes we I don't know if we'll do all 10 boxes on this live but they get enough gelatin my dad Florida what's going on in Florida is weather good out there it's been kind of cloudy here today and humid but still got a good running it was good you also at the latest for days were right yeah I don't know okay so you need these are like just extra gelatin it's not flavored or anything they come in boxes of four and you're going to need one packet two one packet of jell-o no it's raining all day over there I'm sorry to hear that man it's about staying here too yeah we could see the clouds coming in all right I'd like to start with the lightest color first because then I don't have to clean my pan and I hate doing dishes I start with the lightest color we have lemon we have lime we have strawberry we have strawberry banana that's my favorite the strawberry banana man I could eat all of them that's very cherry and then sometimes we like to like layer them and the bigger ones so we'll put like yellow down and let it cool and then put like a red on top and then they come out kind of fine yeah they come out looking real cool they're like layered jello so one of these and then one pack of the gelatin and it goes in your saucepan and then you dumped out our water I did it sorry for water you need 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water definitely no more than like 1/3 cup of water and you want your saucepan on really low and you're just putting it in there long enough to make it melt so it's not granulated anymore you don't bring it to a boil or anything right so you want a really low heat right okay all right so she's just adding one packet of the gelatin and one packet of the actual jello into the pan with the what was it 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup of water we're gonna dissolve it and show you what that looks like in a second just keep it stirring so you don't burn it up again you're not bringing it to a boil or anything like that you're just kind of heating it up enough to dissolve it right hopefully you guys can hear me all right I'm not sure and I'm just gonna try to post this later on even if we don't get any people any more people in here I'll just post it on my channel so you guys can go and watch it for those of you who weren't able to get on the line I don't know about you guys though I'm pretty excited about some freaking keto gummi bears I'm late and it takes really good like the texture is obviously a little bit different they're not exactly like gummy bears but they will really satisfy that kind of candy craving if you're having that I guess you can really do some cool things with these jello packs guys like if you wanted to you could get like a raspberry kind and you can make some keto ganache and then like use the powder to coke the ganache in and maybe like a chocolate raspberry ganache I'd be really good you can really get creative with it and use these the flavoring packets for lots of things how do you go back and see what just dissolved it a little bit but it makes [Music] you take these guys and you suck it up and you just drop it into your molds and start filling them up and then if you want it to go faster you put your gummy bears in the freezer for five minutes and you can pop them out yeah I didn't wait until I get a whole tray and then put them in there and we do have tons big we have like what's five or six of the molds so like if you only had one and you had to do it that way you were making the next batch right but they're pretty quick and easy you guys saw that didn't take very long to dissolve that and now we're just gonna we're getting quite a few actually out of that so yeah you know how faster oh right some of the stars like a plate it is pretty fun something that you could also do with like if you got kids or nieces or nephews er I think some of these are actually chocolate mousse so like if you got chocolate molds in at home oh dude you guys could get those a silicone cupcake molds and make like a huge one I wonder how that come out I the girl who taught us how to make these also said that you could take like salts and take your gummy bears and dip them in salt and then you have like sour gummy bears but I have oh yeah that's outside of it the powder is the sour part of lakes our commutes and stuff yeah the inside thoughts our see you roll them in something sour maybe not pretty cool so I filled up a whole tray of gummy bears now just one packet yeah just one packet push your stars that you've done yeah so yeah it's way more than thing we were wrong about yeah these are like a little bit smaller ago then like average gummi bears they're all the time here I'm gonna do some shells yeah see the comments cuz I don't yeah but how do you get back to them as my question okay so the first batch is pretty much done first batch in the book [Music] strawberry banana so John really loves strawberry banana so I'm gonna double this one cuz it just goes faster yeah use our phone and watch the red comments oh that great idea thank you it means my face these new technology on the phones they need your face I'm already gonna rinse this out bin yeah okay way too late for that all right awesome I know where the chat part is okay so this one's gonna be two packets it's a two packets and then we have double the recipe so then that means you need like 1/2 to 2/3 cups of water so don't forget to like multiply your water as well all right you got it yeah thank you so much that's a great helpful tip I really appreciate so that's how they do it all right I got a little lazy last time and didn't let them all dissolve and like worst cases you're like gummy bears have little air bubbles in them and like little granule it's of extra flavoring so it's not like the end-all if you don't get it perfect not a science basically you know it's still gonna taste good guys last time we made them we had some that were kind of greedy or whatever but we're not very picky picky people especially if we're getting candy on kudos or tricking ourselves into thinking we're getting candy on Keita so she's throwing the ones that we just did in the freezer so they can try to harden up for the next batch before the next batch is done yeah if you guys do try this out let me know how it works out for you guys in the comments go out and get some jello and give it a try make sure you get the sugar free jello yeah sugar free guys that's got the zero carbonate let me see [ __ ] I'm focused ten calories and the whole serving and then zero zero carb one gram of protein anyways keto friendly gelatin comes from are you I don't know it's not vegan friendly well we're not vegans no offense to those who are if you're vegan that's perfectly fine with me with that I just couldn't do it myself I love medium we're very scientific on this channel if you didn't know just kidding I'm pretty excited about this guys we've we've made these before and they're so good and I can actually just throw them into a little snack size ziplock for her throughout the week for lunch and it's just something that gives her like that sweet tooth because that worked she's got this vending machine it's like an evil vending machine full of crap and that has Mike and Ikes in it and that's what she used to always go to before she got on key toes and so this was kind of like our way of finding something for her to have to get ripped to satisfy that craving what she wants to go and get a bag of Mike and Ikes she hasn't done that since it's been really good probably all right so this one same thing this one came out all dissolved and syrupy now we're just gonna do the same thing we're gonna suck it up oh my god it smells so good I feel like I could drink this right now media platform is yours give me this they're crazy okay look like porno but these ones are kind of small and that's a waste of some gummy bears if I mean we don't waste around here guys I may have caught Lindsay licking her plate before because I make food that's so good I'm just saying that was you oh yeah just kidding she doesn't really like her plate guys see they're just little silicone molds of different shapes we got stars and hearts and see shows and all kind of stuff where if any of you have actually tried this or knew about this or heard about this and I hate cooking like if I have to use more than one pan it's it's fine and then all these silicone things I think are dishwasher safe yeah I put them in the dishwasher because we don't I don't like washing dishes so I'm fairly certain they're dishwasher safe thank survived the last round so I'm gonna go in and put some red on top of some of these stars oh I don't think we've waited long enough oh well cool well yeah if this is easy enough to wear my girlfriend's willing to do it then you know you know it's super easy because she's very impatient when it comes to cooking yeah my leftovers because that takes too long I think that's the weirdest thing everywhere I could never eat just cold food I'm hungry I mean let's it's supposed to be eating you cold obviously day two pizza is supposed to be cold oh agree with that microwave pizza is not the same no matter what I'm like oh my leftover is reheated yeah but you also like your food scorching hot and burning your mouth I suppose that's my sister my sister could not eat a meal without her being burning ark she cooks it and then she records it afterwards just to make sure couldn't you use the jello mix with heavy whipping cream and blend it to make like a whipping talking absolutely that's a great idea like a flavored whipped cream like like I was saying you can use it for ganache that's a really good idea I'm actually gonna have to try that and maybe you could even take it and use it in like a frosting you know like a cream cheese frosting to use on some keto cupcakes or some keto mug cakes or something like that so that's a really good other suggestion I might have to do that hopefully we'll get some done ones here we can show you what they look like oh they're starting to freeze actually staying in 200 that was quick pop now you keep on sporting says you've done that with the heavy whipping cream and it was delicious that's a really good suggestion I'm definitely gonna try that out you gotta get creative on keto baby oh man you got so if you haven't if you haven't tried the keto meal replacement shake by American metabolics I'm not sponsored by them or anything like that I just really love the product and it's perfect keto macros and it's delicious and so I tried to make the keto meal pudding and it came out really good it was delicious and I actually put it in the freezer and it turned into ice cream so now I found a super keto friendly ice cream cuz yeah I do like a low top and it's good but sometimes you know there's a lot of carbs in it and sometimes it's hard to just eat half a serving of that thing you want to eat the whole thing and so with the keto meal it's like you could eat the whole thing you probably wouldn't be able to though because it's so much fat in it you'd be satiated I see why you aren't answering texts Tina says what's up sis yeah we're doing a live and uh hopefully you guys are enjoying it oh I'm not sure what you said on the text but I'll get back with you soon if you have keto Mel mix two scoops with heavy cream and it tastes like heaven right that's what I'm talking about them I made made pudding essentially with it actually my god who I've really got a lot of inspiration for from goodie beats the one that I'm sure if you guys are keto friendly you probably know who he is he's pretty awesome and he's going to told me or that's where I got the idea to do that the ice cream with the keto meal I've actually got to order some more of that stuff and getting pretty low on yeah you got that from him also yeah he's pretty awesome guy I love him I think it's called kita with is that the pudding your talk about that they call it that oh he called it pudding and then he called it ice poquito ice creamy all I know is they should call it deliciousness cos it was freaking good man yeah for sure it's really good and these are kind of taking forever to push you out here to it that's probably because I'm just not very good at this so you guys were probably doing much better than me all right so this is the lemon ones you can see that they look just like tiny little gummy bears really good oh those came out really good the texture is pretty spot-on yeah Wow those are delicious I was even better than I remember them being before tea I want to taste the chocolate one - I've got the vanilla cake because it just sounded so good and it's been really good but I think I want to get more of that before trying the chocolate maybe I'll just get both next time safe forget it it's a little expensive but you can use this discount code it's not any more expensive than finding a good protein powder I mean we spent we used to get gold standard before we were on keto and a big thing of that would be like $70 great if you do try the chocolate one man let me know hit me up with some comments and so I don't want to buy it if it's not good making me hungry it's in the fridge right now I'm get ready to go you probably want to rinse out if you use bread before the ring if you want to be super green yes [Music] mom well I suppose living in pasta here they nothing I'm not to eat them all for real they're good guys mmm strawberry banana yeah no I broke my fast if you guys follow me on my channel I intermittent fist my intermittent fist i intermittent fast on Sundays and I love to workout fast we just got done doing that but I came home and broke my fast with a bulletproof coffee he just had 1 tablespoon of MCT oil and 1 tablespoon of heavy whipping cream and so I'll just usually break the fast with something really simple like that and let some time go by like 45 minutes to an hour before I ingest anything else so we're good to go now I do suggest getting like different flavors and colors otherwise you end up with most of them are red you end up with a lot of red gummy bears and it's kind of boring yeah if you want it to be a good visual mix it up mix the colors up that way they look assorted just like you would get a bag of gummy bears at the store they come with assorted colors so you guys definitely have to go out and get some of this sugar-free jell-o's and try this out because this is this definite success good keto hack for those of you who like candy who miss can do on the keto diet this will definitely give you that satisfaction plus I love the sugar-free jealous the ones that come already made they're really good hack for when you have that sweet tooth especially when you're trying to cut and you can't have you're like I'm doing a keto cut right now guys if you haven't been following my mini keto cut series we are on a keto cut and I can't have the sweets that I could have like the keto sweets that I would make I'd make like keto brownies or keto cookies on keto friendly desserts but when you're cutting you obviously want to try to cut all those out and so the only thing that I allow myself to have for like a little sweet tooth is those sugar-free jell-o so I really enjoy those see so we got a little bit of a story color going on we're gonna put the green ones in there when they get done and we'll have a nice color mix we're a little behind on the next batch that gives you time to taste test your product don't you just open a packet of jell-o exploded us you gettin hailed it good for you here so maybe we should have a caution be careful when you're opening your jello pack is guys it might explode inhaling she doesn't share very well so I got sneak sneak a drink I think they're puppy friendly I don't know yeah my wife is Filipino and I have made a lot of her Filipino a lot of her you know that she used to make Kido oh yeah I've never it I don't think I've ever actually had actual Filipino foods but I'm sure it's delicious looks like your favorite Filipino dish dozens of sugar-free jell-o have mellotoxin I'm sure that it has something in there that's probably not great for you and this is probably not going to be something that you eat all the time but you know it's better than putting a bunch of real sugar in your body and eating a bunch of carbs or going off the keto diet this is just trying to find ways to keep yourself on the keto diet and staying keto friendly yeah it does have that ingredient you were talking about but yeah like we just said it's probably way better than actually eating like gummy bears or Mike and Ikes and I'm not a doctor I'm not telling you what to do I'm just telling you what we enjoy the things that we do to help us stay on keto little longer instead of noodles I use cucumber and use it to make noodles absolutely yeah I did that with zucchini also I used miracle noodles as well you never tried miracle noodles I really like those she doesn't really like the texture of them but I really like them and they're zero calories so you can make like a real fatty alfredo sauce with them so the bigger ones I like to mix different flavors in so I'll do half will form flavor and then half with another flavor in it because most of time you're kind of gonna fight those on half anyways and it makes kind of a cool coloring effect alright careful bro it has a higher glycemic index it it's nice to have has a treat but people are even more sensitive to that than sugar in some cases just an FYI I love your stuff hey thanks a lot brother I appreciate it keto home and you're right that you just gotta find out what's gonna work with your body differently for me I've already I've had these before and it didn't have any effect on my ketones or I didn't spike my insulin or anything like that so obviously everybody's different but from what I've researched it's not and this is just my opinion it's not gonna spike my insulin or kick man to ketosis or anything like that so and you are correct like it's not something you probably wanna be eating all day every day but every now and then for a snack to have is perfectly fine in my opinion I use the beanie for noodles as well I got a spiral ER and that thing was like amazing because I used to have to freakin sit there and try to cut him real thing when I was making noodles and they didn't really come out like noodles at all but now I have the pseudo maker that's that spiral things spiral or whatever you throw and then I have a mandolin that I've actually made some really good keto lasagna yeah it's good to change it up sometimes I mean that's how you sustain the diet you know I've never tried to do cucumber noodles though it sounds pretty cool you like a cucumber salad maybe with it I mean like real refreshing for summertime good evening Cindy thanks for tuning in so she's just still over here uh squeezing these out the mold the double batch I'm gonna go ahead and check the ones we got in the freezer yeah pop um we've got some parts here I'm getting pretty excited you know only I think the only thing that we I would change is I would buy bigger mold whatever you call these things silicone molds so that you can do more at one time oh no yeah I should probably clarify that like silicone molds with more molds in them does he it is somewhat of a lot of work for a little bit of product I guess yeah it's not easy it's just like I think to pump out some real volume but I mean you probably don't even need that many anyway to be honest yeah my fingers are getting all sticky [Music] well okay so the green kind of came out like purple it's like a super dark green well they still taste like lime it's like yeah as long as they taste good that's what I care about like I said we're not picking people we don't stress too much about that kind of stuff if you want them even more flavorful John did two packets to one gelatin the texture was a little they still set if you want to do to jello packets so one gelatin but and they were way more flavorful but this was like these are pretty freakin potent already hey so I think if you want like more chewy like if you want that real chewiness you could probably add some more of the gelatin yeah or you can freeze them I used to do that when I was a waitress we'd freeze our gummy bears say it lasts longer in our mouth when we had to let go table table so you could read your gummy bears and they need them alright so in the freezer I'm gonna grab this yeah so the stars are ready and these are gonna be pretty cool here well that one didn't come out different color you know I did that one different color look at that look how thick it is it's awesome and so this guy is layered you can see well it's supposed to be we didn't wait long enough for it to set on the bottom but if you let it set then the layer and they'll be really pretty like that like I said man this is like a really fun activity to do with your kids or your niece or nephew well yellow and red though you know just real fun kid-friendly activity but she we're like kids in heart man because we'll do this on a Friday night you know hanging out I have some dinner and make some gummi bears hey you got I mean if you're into that you probably could make these alcoholic adult gummy bears I guess you can maybe soak them after they come out maybe soak them in some kind of car you like obviously like a spirit without sugar in it you know keto friendly if that's you think all right so all the stars came out really good they're thick ones these ones I like because they're bigger hey I thought you were supposed to be no this was what I'm saying that I can have the sugar-free jell-o except my only thing I give myself when I'm cutting and if you don't know guys we are doing the mini keto cut and I am down and I was this well I'm not gonna spoil that but the last time we weighed immigrant one ninety point eight so we are definitely cutting guys working out good alright so we are just about done with the batch guys okay between my hubby and seven kids I would need I would need at least ten plus boxes of gel we bought ten boxes so I hear you you probably need like 30 or 40 to be honest with you but you could make them all really quick like this is I guess can I see how long it's been or not I don't know how long it's been let me see don't tell me either but I think it's been about 20 minutes maybe we made 10 boxes so it wouldn't take that long to make a bunch for the rest of the week which is what we're doing here all of these are gonna be for the whole week you know unless this one goes off the hinges and just eats the whole thing one night nothing like making alcoholic gummy bears as family fun with the kids haha just kidding hey Tina that was from my sister she's funny 39 minutes you have Vince streaming oh shoot well I'm sure all of that we weren't actually doing the cooking process Blythe dang that's taking a lot longer time guys thank you for that by the way alright alright we are done with the gummi bears so let's see how many do we got in the freezer here okay so we still got a bit push out of the molds and we've already almost filled up this whole container and then we still have this one done and we still have all of these to go so it does your quite a bit and like I said it's easy and fun to do and I definitely recommend that you guys do it so we're probably gonna wrap this thing up you guys have any more questions before I get off here shoot hit me well don't actually hit me she said I mean to me all right and thank you everybody for watching the live this is our first one and I'm sure it's the first of many to come hopefully I'll be able to figure out how to actually post this to my channel she's getting a workout in over here pushing out all these molds I think there's a technique to it you don't push it all the way through then oh you don't want to push it back out I think I'm just gonna like start pushing the back in my mouth it anything you'd like you may have had more people but dsk is doing it live right now in tune I'm not sure if I know who that is I feel bad should I know who that is tsk mmm something-something keto deeper state Pete oh is that is that a can you watch the two lines at once is that keto Savage you're talking about I love keto savage he's awesome Bieber stinky toe yeah kudos Savage is doing a live right now that guy no I love him man he's like he's awesome I completely respect that guy's hustle he inspires me as well he's making his own keto bricks and he's out there hustling working so hard and Daddy and that's you know really what I want to do is well just just work hard and you know get to where he's that where he's just living the life man he's living his dream right now all right so that's what happens when they're not completely set and you pop them out they care open oh no go ahead and take me balance no problem but oh they're very sticky in the freezer what's a good time to do lives guys do you know is there like a certain time of day certain times that work that are most beneficial to do a live album know how that works but okay great I will wash these discs while she keeps on pushing these out all right guys I'm gonna go ahead get this place cleaned up get these dishes done and everything but thank you again so much for watching us on this live my hands all cut

You get Rummy Bears! That's right, do you\nsee that, she's happy, okay, 'cause she just ate the rum. So we put some Gummi Bears in there, okay, fine, good to go.

because of covid and i bought a little bit of the halloween candy that we would normally you know get from trick-or-treating is eaties here except for the blood and brain i know this is very interesting i've never seen this before this here is syrup i think it's syrup i hope it's syrup i mean they wouldn't sell it it was not edible right so this is supposed to be a bag of kind of like oh it's leaking yeah because i did it yeah you did do you want to try this one for summer it's kind of cool look how cool it is i've never had this before never know and then we got some brain over here gummy brains we have sticky sticky syrup and we have some marshmallows of course then we have eyeballs some eyeballs and we have these little whirly things these are just add-ons really because they're so good yeah i love the rainbow um sour patch we have some cute little burger gummies here they actually feel really good when you like do this yeah they're quite soft and it actually says fries i'm excited for these because these smell and look really good and we have oh henry i always ask the kids to get me an old henry bar every time they go trick-or-treating yeah and that's what they ask for actually right yes and kitkat i love kitkat yeah that's the one thing that i left out so yes well we don't have kitkat we don't have kitkat it's okay we got these so okay which one are you gonna start with emma i feel like i'm gonna start with the oh henry where's my oh henry oh it's right here because it's gonna melt oh yeah you're right the chocolate is melting cheers if we went trick-or-treating this year emma what would you be a school person what do you mean a school person i got a teacher no a school person like a student i would guess that you would want to be mulan because you were obsessed with mulan for a couple months when the movie came out and you liked that character since last year then i moved on to stitch there isn't a costume for stitch though i can make it a mangas character or monkeys i'm not familiar with the language it's a game i know it's a game i've seen you play it a couple of times is it just like hide and seek no how do you play that game so it's like um there's like either like two or one imposters and uh you can dress up when you're waiting for like more people to join because you have like these like a maximum like it's either 10 or like maybe four people so and then i always joined like almost like nine players to 10 so and then i joined and then um so we have to figure out who's the imposter so if if the impostor kills someone and you turn into a ghost and you try to have to do all the tasks to win tasks i mean and find the imposter yeah and the other p people have to report the body and the imposters can vent like go through um like vents and then um um the crewmates can like uh pool mates yeah crewmates they can press an emergency button and they can report the body and find out who is the imposter and then they just go floating around when they they so does the imposter like try to take you out like try to kill you in the game uh um or do you just have to figure out who it is yeah you have to figure out like the crewmates like one imposter if and impossible because you're really good if the imposter kills you you turn into a ghost and you have to finish all tasks to win if you're a see you ghost and you can't um like help anyone and you can text in the game but if you're a ghost you cannot text no one can see you yeah it's like serious like in two if there's two girls a ghost and there's one more ghost so three ghosts you can talk to the two other goats ghosts because they're ghosts you lost me at ghost your mind you should try these gummies these are supposed to be zombie gummies you know actually quite tasty and they're not too sweet so which is good oh man oh good i think i'm gonna try the brain here the brain it was a little sour when i had a little taste oh let's see you can handle it right here okay let's try do you think i'll like it ready no because you said it so trying to handle it looks good it's really good emma i'm i'm not lying it's like sweet and sour but but leaning towards sweet and it's gummy which is good i'm having this i haven't tried it yet i was drinking water it's kind of gooey this is like making a good asmr sound i love gummy sounds it's sticky and chewy like a weird you do that to me all the time she would be like mom come here mom and she'll be like you do that to me all the time not like that here how about i'm still chewing hurry up how can i help you handle my small mouth this is really good i'm surprised i really want to try sticky though i really want to try these so these are kind of like rope candies no rainbow they're a little salty and sour i can make sushi i do miss the sushi candy video though oh yeah i got the zombie candy in here so you can turn them into like a little swirl do you miss trick-or-treating emma yeah yeah but it's weird how you have to go to people's houses and you have to walk it's fun i remember can't you just go to a drive-through like drive through trick-or-treating yeah that would be a really good idea but go to the carnival like and they have like these machines yeah where they just um like put get a bucket scoop some and then put it in this like machine thingy and then it serves it to you and you just go like this to your bag then you get candy that's smart my tongue these burger gummies are sour actually they're not sweet or sour that's good leave a pen mark on your nose it's cool because

right up here I think it's the glucose syrup the glucose so these are sugarless these are supposed to be for people that are trying to wash their way in a little bit I guess but yeah if you have a certain amount of these they will literally make you crap your pants so this is the first time in which it will be that will be my first if you try these candies we recommend beginning with 1/4 of a serving size or less that what they say with like like weed products - like when used to be like a little bit out of time before an Nvidia but if you do too much too quick you just like the freak out

these false finishes okay hopefully stop soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "c7Z6ZSQZhz0": "Here's a fun recipe for grapefruit gummy\nbears from chef Jon min-ji's at Le Cuvier winery in California. This is\nserved as a pairing for one of the Le Cuvier wines but it has no alcohol in it;\nit's great for kids, it's great for anyone who likes gummy bears or\ngrapefruit juice. The recipe is very easy; start by putting about 120 milliliters,\nabout half a cup, of grapefruit juice into a bowl. Take about 22 grams, or about\n3/4 ounce, unflavored gelatin and sprinkle it on top of the juice. While\nthe gelatin is softening you're going to take about 177 milliliters, or another\n3/4 cup, of juice and put it into a small saucepan, and 59 milliliters, or\nthat's 1/4 cup of sugar, to the juice in the pan and you're going to heat that\nuntil the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot mixture from the pan over the\ngelatin in the bowl and mix it up until it's very smooth. If you like, you can\nwhisk it to get rid of any small lumps of gelatin but then you're going to want\nto let it sit so that the bubbles subside before you pour out the mixture\ninto the mold. Gummy molds are not hard to find; I bought this one online, you can\nget them in department stores, housewares stores, and they come in different sizes.\nThis is actually considered a jumbo size, gummy bear although they really are pretty small, only about an inch in length. Since the mold is very flexible, it's a\ngood idea to put it on something solid so when you put it in the refrigerator\nit doesn't bend and make a mess. Take the grapefruit mixture and pour it\ninto a pitcher, and then use the pitcher to fill the mold. When you're pouring the\nliquid in you don't have to fill each little cavity individually, you can just\npour it in and then spread it with a spatula, an offset spatula is helpful.\nNow these will firm even if left at room temperature, but if you refrigerate them\nit will happen a lot faster. These are chilled, but they're not going\nto melt at room temperature. They're really fun and they taste good!\nThanks for joining me for One Minute Maven; for more tips look for us on\nYouTube!", "Xl5MkfW9VYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "zuDltFW5VcE": "yeah we have a couple of hundred percent half the goose all right today I'm going to show you how to make vegan vegan CMOS gummies okay this is a recipe that will most definitely stick this is a recipe that will you know have the gummies keep they will hold not melt you know once you put on that room temperature or in refrigerator this is a recipe because people have been complaining about not having the gummy recipe or if they were attempting to do it but you know it didn't come out right so yeah I'm making a video for it okay so here you go all right so you have a couple of CMOS you wanna make sure you got your blender on here so we want to go ahead and pour that in there all right so in the batch I usually do about for about four or five tablespoons of sea moss I put five tablespoons in as I added two tables spoons of a bar Sara four tablespoons CMOS jail okay so you want to have your a bar a bar powder [Music] two tablespoons I like one healthy tables on and deadlight I'm not so healthy table small so like a little over one and a half all right so the trick to this is I so yeah you wanna you know don't put it on medium heat just keep it on I mean almost today almost hi all right but then you know a little lower you wanted to you know boil real good especially you're gonna get that egg water boil a little good so anyways gonna work all right now you can get a wispy said that for like three minutes but you know you want to keep this day long for about at least 10 minutes but whisking it alright stirring it cost you know you can keep an eye on it you know make sure that is still liquid all right but I say give it about let's say seven to ten minutes okay while you're constantly whisking it came out um two tablespoons of agar agar powder two tablespoons of Gavi sweetener all right juice mr.

was that so here's the flavors I got something up real quick singing toast cadet ship is delicious candy can't see it pineapple I'm gonna make a pineapple down the so do everything I need here beaker my electric stir mr. gummy candy flavor here flavor here you go 25% I got my nicotine hear and understand off with that so this is 100 milligrams per milliliter so whatever I put in here cuz I'm gonna make a 100 milli or badge he's going to be equal familiar no double down 2.5 ya gonna wash that off it work alright don't eat candy you put in some gummy candy 20 milliliters we go I had a 20 milliliters of gummy candy in there better record that I guess not what fun I just chose 20% for that because I wanted that TV the most prominent flavor I wanted 5 milligrams of pineapple in there pineapple there we go nice five years.when would do next is add 15 milliliters of propylene glycol so meet 30 milliliters of propylene glycol total because the flavor is propylene glycol 40 nice pour the rest of the mix into I [Music] tried making 200 milliliters at a time I need a bigger stirring stick you think okay the music is mmm let's focus friend is sweet then I drop the Skype ticking and we're gonna steer this no pineapple gummy bears mhm yeah watch that for a few minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know now it is smelling really good right now the strong odor of gummy bears and pretty faint odor of pineapple so I miss it with that a magnetic mixer and I like how white and fluffy it's because that means a lot of air went into it and that'll oxidize the nicotine it smells really good right now really strong so for my final step I got this dope Tupperware here it is a 119 not 1880 milliliter Tupperware I just pour that in here I don't always put 25% flavor in there it's gonna be pretty strong order than this [Applause] [Music] senex flavors and since the fda is coming up with a ban on flavors I would highly recommend doing it yourself if you want to continue to be flavored electronic cigarettes but it's not just about the ban on flavors it's also about being able to select your nicotine level I put that away where do we sit dangerous 15 is highly addictive man

was going to koala show it was on Nickelodeon it was part of the pin wheel pin wheel spinning around look at my pan well and see what I found anyways I was saying me baby stay in the noggin hi I'm onna I'm a bun and we are those annoying beginning guys today we're making gummy bears but since gummy bears are usually made with gelatin and often contain honey bees wax palm oil we're going to veganize it yeah these are really simple and you can make them in any flavor you want you just take your favorite fruit and you throw it into a blender or food processor and you just obliterate it and then you take that and you run it through a strainer until you're left with a smooth root puree for the honey we are going to be returning to agave something we've used many times before and for the gelatin we will be using agar powder now a car is derived from a variety of red algae as opposed to gelatin which we know comes from the bone muscle tendons and skin of multi cows pigs and often fish we are also going to be using a vitamin C pocket with one of our flavors now we've found that it adds a penny sort of taste to it but you might like so feel free to use that with one or more flavors and get a healthy vitamin C boost while you're at it then as always this recipe is delicious affordable and easy to make so let's make it [Music] look at these these turned out really good they're so cute you may have noticed in the thumbnail that there's other shapes we took the leftover and we just filled our ice cube trays we only had one gummy bear mold so we had these ice cube trays and made gummy drops and granted they're not gelatinous because there's no gelatin in them more like Swedish Fish looks true yeah Finnish fish or sour patch kids and sort of the texture of a summer picture yeah they're tasty if you guys have a Trader Joe's where you live they taste like those fruit bars at the front of the trader goes the whole advertising campaign on the packaging is like 100% Apple and it tastes like enough they do contain real fruit which is something that you probably should be eating and ingredients you can read right we should come up with a new word it's a vegan word Pig Latin egg arias which sounds like a villain in a comic book egg arias you will be stopped this time he's also aren't going to be nearly as like sweet and sugary mm-hmm there's a gummy bear you can use real sugar but a gobby is a perfectly fine sweet replacement you know what else has sugar in it Brut mm-hmm we made a Totoro jelly oh this is before we started filling her ice cube trays with the leftover yeah so this was just sitting in the bottom of the bowl and it got rough on big RFID we'll be sure to start filling those molds as soon as you see the mixture gets thick yeah because if you wait too long it's going to set yeah take it off the stove go for it deliver right away yeah don't leave coat at all so there's a little history about gelatin why gelatin what pork a gelatin candies were originally inspired by turkish delights and even Japanese rice candy which were originally made with rice or corn starch in the 1900s we saw the beginning of gelatin in Great Britain with certain gummy candy and as for gummy bears Hans Riegel who is from Germany created the original Haribo gummy bear it was inspired by the dancing bears he'd see parading on his street and they were originally longer and then later on they smooshed them down to make them look cuter he started out by using corn starch as well but then found that they weren't as chewy as he wanted them to be and that's when gelatin came into play no more animal exploitation mean chewy candy people will argue with us and probably many of you that we need animal product it's not about taste it's about the nutrients and the vitamins and the buh-buh-buh that we get from these animal products we're hunters we borrow this is actually a case where it's completely 100 percent is a very extra yeah look I wanted them cure and there's all of people who think that we must have gelatin in our diets because hair skin and nails eating a lot of veggies no drinking a lot of water getting proper sleep there are a lot of things you can do so guys we've been really working on educating ourselves about nutrition and vitamin C which we added to one of the flavors it's actually really easy to get from just your fruits and veggies oranges red peppers kale Brussels sprouts broccoli strawberry grapefruit wobba a lot of fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C one cup of kale for example contains 134 percent of your daily value brussel sprouts 80 percent the half a cup of moong juice that we used in our gummies is your whole day's worth of vitamin C fresh squeezed orange juice like you take a literal orange and you'd squeeze it until the juice comes out you understand these foods they derived from real thing you can get your vitamin C with fruits and vegetables here's the key you have to eat fruits and vegetables I like to think that the Earth Mother Nature they haven't kind of worked out yeah like if you eat the beans that you're supposed to eat then you should get what you need to get right right we've evolved so gradually as human-beings where technology has evolved way faster than we have exactly not our core we are still herbivores from Africa that need to eat our fresh fruits and fresh veggies it's all what people want to see and want to hear and want to believe people like to hear that meat dairy eggs and seafood are good for you because it means they can keep eating it without feeling bad or feeling guilty or feeling like they're doing harm to their own body or harm the planet or harm to the animal but it doesn't make it true people love to hear good things about their bad habits I got my blood work done Matthew did and everything were you protein efficient you must produce protein deficient that is the one thing out of all of it that was horrible it wasn't just one check it the great thing about eating vegan living vegan eating healthy living a compassionate lifestyle proof is in the literal play yes dr. John McDougall got kicked out of an obesity conference because in his presentation in his slides he was alluding to the fact that this is one of the only areas of medical science where you can be obese and still give advice on how to defeat obesity I'm not fat shaming the general population I'm fat shaming people who are teaching you and your family how to live and eat and this means life or death for you and your children I think that's okay the analogy is if this is was the tobacco medicine conference and you had speakers up on stage smoking cigarettes or this was the alcohol alcoholism medicine conference and speakers got up on stage visibly drunk telling you about the road to sobriety I mean think about these three together you have fat sickly people standing on stage talking to your doctor's your dietitians and the press about how to get trim and healthy I think it's fair to point this out what you preach is that's a comedy yeah life recommendations you can or you that animal products are good for you and just looking at the results at this obesity conference as well in the program there was also a lecture titled how to retain obesity patients in your practice the art of attracting and retaining patients to your obesity medicine practice keep you coming back in the door a revolving door you call those boomerangs in retail oh I like it you want me to do it I'm not gonna do that alright ok ok oh you're not good as that no oh good mmm record enjoy blueberries or blackberries or jingle hmm why I think I'm gonna mingle try all the fruits that we didn't do oh so guys if you liked this video make sure to give us a thumbs up comment please feel free to comment and you love to hearing from you if you want to present facts and science and sources we love sources really like horses rather than blanket statements we will be happy to engage and respond in a respectful way we want our channel to be PG we are very very flexible but there are certain kinds of language that are just not productive the personal insult territory and the vulgarity we want people of all ages to be able to come here and learn and try our recipes and hopefully you know engage engage in the conversation yeah and if you make any of these recipes please keep tagging us on Instagram you like that we so awesome cooking with seitan 13 made our English mix me muffins Lizzie violet made our fish sticks thank you guys for tagging us thank you we're so excited that you're enjoying our recipes and we surpassed the 900 subscriber mark yay awesome that's amazing thank you guys please continue to tell a friend continue to spread the word we'll have to put something special together for one thousand subscribers we love hearing those comments that say oh I thought you guys had a bigger following it really means a lot to us it's encouraging and conspiring is what we like to do we want to do this full-time we're preparing for our first event as well yeah that's exciting we'll have like a booth in the table yeah we're designing our banner what and so from the bottom of our hearts thank you guys thank you I'm gonna cry", "T8RDPj1mCFQ": "JIM: SOME ROCK ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL PARENTS ARE UPSET TONIGHT AFTER LEARNING THAT DRUG-LACED GUMMY BEARS WOUND UP IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS.

let's pick my tape measure and measure this thing it is about 26 inches to give you an idea of how thick this thing is we're gonna compare it to our little gaming phone right here that's the other oh give me one looks a few inches long this is 120 times bigger now it's about 260 times bigger each one has two flavors then this one is blue raspberry and charity I would probably picture you can get this at vat19.com they also have the world's largest gummy there you go comment if you want us to make a video about this thanks for watching and see you guys next time", "wzzn1t-__Xs": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some boom candy um i have the these are gummy bears this is prosecco and rose and i have the strawberry daiquiri gummy bears and the sangria bears so we found three of these these three we found at home goods they were 4.99 at homegoods this one we went in marshalls after home goods and we found this one that we hadn't bought at home goods in marshalls and it was 4.99 so uh hungas and marshalls and what tj maxx are all the same they're owned by the same people so yeah they were stuffed but they're wrong about it they got a lot of things so you might see like when we were in marshalls we didn't see these that we had just bought in home goods so it was this lone random bag they got so you just have to be aware and kind of remember what you bought from place to place if you're like us so these are gummy candy gummy bears nine pieces 32 grams is 100 calories distributed by boom candy toronto this is ontario canada so it's a canadian company and these are refillable bugs so ooh how pretty that is a strong smell yeah all right it looks like there's you didn't get a white one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten looks like there's ten different flowers they're they're a lot you want to sort them out so you have a picture for you did you get orange yeah you got orange yeah i think you got them all yeah 10 flavors that's a lot and it does not tell um what the flavors are so we just get to guess yeah and one of these is heat i'm sorting them out so we can have one for a picture oh okay let's see you you need a clear one of course we could sort them out after we're finished with this too that way we're not taking i think we're almost there we're on this one what flavor we're missing a light green there we go all right okay those are gonna go back in the bag okay these will go back in the bag and um which one do you want to try first i don't know you can grab it on my hand here okay let's see let's try a clear who knows with clear one i'm gonna guess pineapple yep pineapple absolutely pineapple it took me a second to get it but then once i got it i got it yeah that's a good flavor it's a very nice pineapple yeah and good and soft the gummies are good and soft too so the textures are even really good now what do you think the lemon honey i'm assuming yeah lemon i'm gonna stick those on there these are all the same flavors so these are really cute little bears too i love the texture the texture is very um they're not sticky no and they're soft but they're not really really super mushy soft um so they have some chew to them but they're not rubbery um and sticky that lemon is very uh refreshing it's not like a cleaner that's not chemically at all no this is a pink so are we gonna go strawberry oh okay no grapefruit or something like that i was gonna say cantaloupe that's some citrusy like a grapefruit or a mango mangoes usually orange though um that's some kind of citrus i'm going to say grapefruit or maybe even a tangerine might be a tangerine i don't know i think it's more grape yeah it's more tart than them okay now we have a light blue um i have no idea let's say raspberry i don't know it's very refresh reminds of the ocean that reminds you of like something just refreshing yes i don't know what it is i don't either it's some kind of berry but i don't know what i know it does taste like berry but i i i can't be sure what that is it's not as strong as like a raspberry or light green which i would think would be lime lime or watermelon hmm this is going to be apple apple definitely apple green yeah that one is stronger i think that one was lime it just wasn't strong this is purple we are eating only half so we're meat and i eat a whole bag of rice beans right i mean gummy gummy bears soy beans because we have so many to try that's why we're having them um that grape was it's great but it's a lighter gray it is it uh honestly i wish the grape had been stronger just because i really like grape it's good that's a lot maybe if you've eaten a whole one it would have been better but oh i like the orange you've got a good flavor orange is nice orange is one of those that although companies have messed it up before it's hard to mess up the orange yeah do the blue or the red red oh i like that cherry yes that is an excellent cherry it is strong too almost cough droppy yes which is a good thing it's very nice that is blue raspberry yeah it's definitely blue raspberry or or is it more tropical bunch no i think it's blue raspberry um make that mix with the cherry probably through y'all right but yeah that if you ate both of those at the same time you probably have a really good tropical patch if you mix the blue and you get that light um orange one with that kind of citrusy that sharp citrus flavor yeah that would be a good mixture yeah you could mix these and do your own stuff these are a really good job i mean i keep saying jelly bean gummy bears i think these are very we really like the albanese the quality i think these are very in line with the office oh yeah yeah i think albany's are actually a little tougher than these are yeah these these are very very good quality flavors are really good worth five dollars for that bag i think this is gonna be interesting prosecco and rose nine pieces are 90 calories yeah these are all the same i know there's different well there's three different colors it looks like these are like sugar coated oh they're the yellowy kind of color yeah what um let's see what you're just gonna have i would think they're all the same but we'll try to just to make sure because i did just eat it oh wow i don't like that no at all no but you have to try another one oh gosh it does have that prosecco flavor you know what though i don't mind prosecco i don't like a little bit those so mostly different flavors because that one was worse than the first one yeah which one did we not draw the yellow this one you've been cutting them i don't know which one you these are a little tougher too yeah but they're sugar coated on the outside [Applause] yeah i just they're a little too earthy for me yeah they have a um they have a um oh okay a bitterness to them yeah it's that's probably the rose um yeah it's a it's it's bitter and biting and you're you're stuck with that bitter flavor all up in your nasal passages it's not good and so up in your crew yeah so as much as we raved about the gummy bears i would pass on this you know what though that would be a flavor i personally buy anyway right so if that sounds interesting to you you would just have to try them honestly this one is strawberry daiquiri these are all of the signs this one sounds interesting these are all the same so just grab one yeah these are definitely tougher and this is sugar coated as well 11 pieces is 110 calories really good strawberry flavor though yes i really like that just know that they are a tougher chew than the original bears right i would prefer the original but now i really do like that sugar it's a very small flavor yeah it's that sugar cutting is nice i wouldn't have said strawberry daiquiri i would have just said strawberry i don't know it kind of reminds me of that um you have a little whipped up kind of strawberry i can i can picture that in my mind when i mean that but it's not as i like that prosecco no it's not you don't get the alcohol kind of flavor this is sangria spoiler alert we usually don't want 11 pieces or 110 calories it's a better flavor than i thought because we've had other things that saying we absolutely hated it yes because it tastes like rotten fruit right um that's actually really good it's very sweet yeah this is actually very very nice it um it it has to me just a berry flavor it does i can see berries like like even leaning towards like a raspberry or something it's just and i do like that sugar on the outside these are tougher really i think they're bigger too though yeah they seem bigger when but the gummy bears are long and they're thin these are shorter and they're thicker looking but you were also cutting them in half i was but you can tell a difference i mean when i when i'm eating it though it feels bigger only because i was eating half a gummy bear oh well that's yeah that's true that's why i didn't think about that yeah well the strawberry daiquiri and the sangria i would buy those yes i would pick the regular berries over any of them yes because those all those flavors are so so good and this would be just a niche thing if you really if that sounded interesting to you trying we wouldn't buy them again but right so if you're looking at the front of these they say like gummy candy this one says gummy candy you need to look on the back and then it tells you on the back exactly what it is but if you see this brand i think you are very safe to get it because i think at least the gummy bears yeah i think they're delicious yeah so definitely worth a try so i'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] you", "8cWP1sf1taA": "what's going on you guys welcome back to a new video today

like even the sprinkles so i have the ice cream we're gonna try it out to see what it tastes like vanilla look i was expecting i was like this would be vanilla for sure it is vanilla i'm also going to try the little cone strawberry this one is the one that i'm really excited for oh not me ruining the chocolate i really want to try the chocolate so i'm going to give it a try it tastes just like chocolate really well that's good so the donut one has two layers i'm gonna try the strawberry one first this one it tastes just like the chocolate drizzle on top of the donut overall i really think that the donut one was my favorite one just because like i had a lot of different flavors going on versus like the ice cream cone so i have to say this one is my favorite one so i'm going to sit here and enjoy my dessert and then we'll see what we have for dinner it is time for our last meal of the day yay i'm lucky so happy because i'm like i'm ready for some real food i'm tired of candy honestly after this video i don't think i'm gonna have candy for a very very long time so for a dinner we're having a whole buffet we do have a sushi here we also have some noodles as well as a taco now fun fact i don't know if any of you guys know this but i have never ever ever in my life tried sushi like raw sushi my mom never let me eat sushi so this is the closest i'm ever gonna get to sushi so let's see let's try i'm guessing this is kind of like the soy sauce the details i know it's so cute i really like how they put like the detail in like the rose look at this i don't know what this is supposed to be because i'm not really into sushi let's try this one it's like a double roll me trying to use chopsticks and i don't even know how to use them these are some of my favorite candies but usually i get like the peach ones i have never tried the green ones what flavor is this oh this is apple i have never tried apple ones i usually always get like the peach ones but this is really good i also want to try this one because i think this one has like a marshmallow oh the marshmallow you have to try this that is good it's like so soft and chewy that one is pretty good that one is really good i also want to try the noodles you should try one of these let's try is it lemon i don't know what is it i don't think this has a flavor it sounds crunchy oh it tastes like perfume why does it taste like perfume i don't know oh yeah no i'm not a big fan of that one no let's try some noodles this is what i'm talking about also look at the detail of this it even comes with a little egg so let's try the noodles let's try to slap the noodles impossible i really want to try the little egg oh these what are these thinking it's like marshmallow it's really it has it's like coated in sugar it looks like a marshmallow reminds me of peeps it reminds me of the peeps that's banana flavor that's really good look at this taco i'm really sad this is cardboard i really wish that like they can make the shell like gummy i feel like that would have been awesome but look at everything that's inside you should try to bite everything at the same time these are really really tough to chew guys but i have to say my favorite ones that i tried from everything were these especially because of the marshmallow it was so good also the little green rings i have never tried apple flavor so that was my first time trying it as well of this so i guess kind of like the marshmallows were like my favorite ones just because they weren't like so tough on my teeth and i wasn't like yanking on them but overall i have to say today's video was pretty successful after this video i am not going to have any more gummy bears or anything that is gummy related i'm not going to be eating it for a while i am so glad that this challenge has come to an end because right now all i can think about is just in and out a real burger with some real fries and a real drink yes that is exactly what i deserve because i feel like i put meat in my stomach through a lot after this video so don't mind me guys i'm going to go get some real food because i am literally done with this gummy food all right guys that is the

New Gummy Bear t-shirts at teespring.com/storres/emezie", "fzVGMgaDHpI": "Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today I really wanted to make a Nerdy Nummies themed treat And lately I have been eating a lot of like fruit snacks and gummy candy, so I thought, let's put these two things together. So today, we're gonna be making Nerdy Nummies Gummies to do so I'll be using the Nerdy Nummies mold It's got a cute little smart cookie logo, 8-bit heart and a little dino. Oh! Also, I'm using the cherry gummy mix from my baking line I'll put links down below to both of these if you're interested or you can use whatever Gummy recipe you'd like alright... LET'S GET STARTED! Making these gummy treats is super easy mode, The things you'll need will be: Half a cup of water, one box of gummy mix and two molds I'm using two molds because the box of gummy mix fills two of them and then half the box would fill one Let's put it all together! To make these Nerdy Nummy Gummies, the first step: combine your water and mix into a Heat Safe Bowl Whisk together until well combined. Now It's time to heat it up! Take it over to the microwave and heat for 90 seconds, then remove from the microwave, give it a quick stir, Then place it back in the microwave for another 60 seconds You'll know, it's done when the top is bubbling. Once your gummy mix is ready, pour it into something with a good pour spout I'm gonna be using this small bowl in my baking line cuz it has a really good pour spout and before you pour your mixture into the cavities, lightly grease them, then slowly pour ur gummy mix into each cavity of the mould. And don't worry if you spill a little like I did you can take a little damp paper towel, wipe it up, OR, or just leave it after it sets You can just peel it off and have another little snack. He Hee! And just a helpful tip if your gummy mix starts to cool while you're working with it You can just pour it back into a heat safe container and pop it in the microwave for a few Seconds once you pour in all the gummy mix it's time to chill! Pop these in refrigerator for one hour and then I'm Gonna watch whatever my favorite Netflix show is! Once they've completely set and chilled in the fridge it's time to pop them out! What I like to do is give your mold a tug at the top and bottom and on the Sides then push from the bottom and pop your gummies out Look at that! I picked up all of the detail, Looks adorable! the first ones for me Mm-Hmm these days, just like my grandma's cherry candies. I love them now. Just keep popping out the rest of your gummies and TADAAA!!!! Here are the nerdy nummies gummies that we made today not only is this treat super easy mode? But I just love that you can see all of the detail look at how detailed these little cookies are and the dinosaur Adorable I'll be posting a bunch of pictures and the instructions on Rosanna Pansino Com Facebook Instagram and Twitter so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these gummies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations Especially with their nerdy nummies themed it really really makes my day if you like this video make sure to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my YouTube channel and if you have any other ideas for any other nerdy nummies Please let me know leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen also if you're interested in the mold or the gummy mix we use today I'll Put links down below alright. Thanks a lot. You guys bye.

million other people made their own story games like so many story games were so trash and then people stopped being interested in story games because of the trash games so I'm hoping it doesn't become like that with a piggy inspired game so make good ones", "8deEGBKOykQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be making some keto sugar-free gummies I totally love these gummies I love that there's no food coloring and they're so simple to make they're easy they're kid-approved you can take them on the go and they're really low-calorie so if you want to see how to make these and how to customize them yourself then go ahead and keep watching the video you don't need that many things you're gonna need some hot water some teabags some gelatin liquid sweetener and some mix-ins if you'd like to switch up the flavors today I'm going for Tazo passion tea I love this blend it's so delicious it's very fruity so I love that I can make some fruit gummies and I also love that I can make sour gummies which I'll show you how I do that in just a second I like to use something with a spout so this little measuring cup works perfect for this if you don't have a water kettle then you're gonna want a microwave or boil your water ahead of time and then let it steep in this little pitcher so that there's a spout on it so after it cools down I put it in the refrigerator to chill completely look how dark that is it's just so good it extracted all of that delicious flavor from the teabags and you don't have to squeeze out your teabags like I do but I like to get all the liquid out some T's it can make the liquid cloudy and if you want to avoid that to make nice clear gummies just don't squeeze it I don't have a problem with this specific tea so at this point you with your cold liquid you're gonna add your gelatin you can get this kind of gelatin which you would just have to measure out with a table spoon or a scale like I'm doing here and I'm gonna measure out 28 grams but you can also use the packets and it's four tablespoons or four packets so I'm gonna measure out 28 grams which is also equal to one ounce on my scale and then I'm gonna stir that in completely you want to mix it in really really really well and if your liquid is cold it'll mix in really well so when you do chill it make sure you chill your tea down all the way and then you're gonna microwave it for 30 seconds three times depending on your microwave until it's completely liquid and hot and then I just like to give it one more stir just to make sure that it's totally incorporated I like liquid sucralose you guys can use whatever sweetener you want you can use granular sweetener and just make sure that it's hot enough to mix in and totally dissolve the sweetener so I like to use a roughly half of a teaspoon of sweetener you can use liquid stevia if you'd like and then at this point you'll add in all of your mix ins you can do apple cider vinegar for Tang but I want mine really sour so I went ahead and I'm going to use some citric acid I have a bunch of this stuff it's food grade and it's totally fine to add if you don't want to use some sort of man-made substance then you can use lemon or whatever else you'd like so just mix it in really really well you want that completely dissolved because that stuff is super sour and if you'd like you can add your extracts I have lemon and raspberry but I'm not gonna add anything else to mine but that's just an option I want to let you guys know about so give a one final little stir always taste your mixture because that's what your gummies are gonna taste like I wanted mine just a little bit more sweet so I added a little bit more liquid sucralose you know do what you guys want to do if you want I'm super sweet Yolo just do whatever you want to do and then I am going to scrape off all the bubbles because once this sets the bubbles are going to basically dry on top and to avoid it looking not so appealing you just go ahead and scrape those off it's not a big deal I really love this mold I got it at a thrift store but I'm pretty sure that you could find something similar on eBay or Amazon and it works really well for these little individual gummies if you're extra just scrape off the top again just to make sure that they're nice and clear and chill them all the way so those are easy to remove from the mold and this is what you're left with eat some and then package the rest up I keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're nice and chewy every single time I want one and I hope you guys try this out if you do leave me a comment down below let me know what you think thank you so much for watching you guys I'll see you in my next video [Music]", "Y6orR8ckPWs": "- That's good, I

founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you

I'm Sofia and today I'm going to\nshow you how to make some edible slime. So I know slime is not normally edible, it's\nusually made out of, like, glue and stuff that you can't eat, but today, since\nwe're in a bakery, it's gonna be done edible! So first I'm gonna take like a\nhandful or two handfuls of gummy bears. I'm gonna put these in the microwave for\nabout 30-45 seconds and then we'll be back. So now that they are done in the\nmicrowave, I'm gonna mix it and you want to work a little bit quick just so it\ndoesn't harden and it you have to reheat it. It's turning into more of a liquified gummy bear. Be careful, it may be hot. I'm gonna add some cornstarch just so\ncould help the slime form. So you could mix it with a spoon or your hand. I\nprefer my hand because it could help mix. You're gonna want to add about three\nspoons total of cornstarch and you want to just mix it in so it would form. Be\ncareful, it still maybe hot. Okay, almost there. Again it's gonna get all over your\nhands. I'm gonna add my final scoop of cornstarch so now I have three scoops of\ncornstarch. Since this came out, like, a really ugly color I'm gonna add some\nblue. And you could always add edible glitter -\noh this is gonna get all over my hand! My gosh okay so once you get it you could\nlike kind of play with it and since it is edible you could even eat it! Tastes\njust like gummy bears! This may give you an arm workout, too, but\nit's okay because it's fun! It's like I'm pulling taffy! It feels like slime on my hands, it's\njust instead of slime that comes off your hands, it's the slime that stays on\nyour hands like for a really long time! Thank you guys so much for watching!

I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "XV5PE1M8Hkk":

with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "BEe0Urc7S00": "hi guys alright so this video should appeal to anyone with a sweet tooth because we're going to be talking about

up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "nFHpiBPmCns": "[Music] today I'm showing you how to make Prosecco gummy bears I'm gonna use regular Prosecco and then this pink Prosecco so that I'll have two different color gummy bears but regardless of color whether it's champagne Prosecco or cava the recipe is the same in a pot combine 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar and 25 grams of sugar get the pot on medium heat and bring the mixture up to a boil for one to two minutes agar needs to boil in order to gel properly so make sure it hits a rolling boil for at least a minute pull the mixture off the heat and at this point I like to transfer it to a smaller bowl to prevent it from cooling down too quickly next you'll need some gummy bear molds I just got these on Amazon they were really affordable and easy to find and place these molds onto a sheet pan this just makes them easier to move later then use a dropper this one actually came with the molds to stream the Prosecco mixture into the little gummy bear cavities [Music] place the gummy bears in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until firm oh now I'm just gonna repeat this whole process with the regular Prosecco so again 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar agar and 25 grams of sugar bring it all up to a boil for one to two minutes transfer to a small container and use a dropper to fill the gummy bear molds while I'm doing that I'd just like to take a minute to thank living gin for sponsoring today's video by using their egg our agar in this recipe we're able to keep these gummy bears which are traditionally full of gelatin completely plant-based if you're looking to replace gelatin and any of your recipes or are wanting to try out these Prosecco gummy bears check out the link in the description box below for where you can purchase the living gin agar agar that I'm using here there are also a bunch of recipes on their website as well as on their Instagram both of which I'll also link to and if you're feeling competitive and are interested in getting your recipes featured by them they recently started holding monthly vegan recipe contests where people vote for their favorite recipe so if you want to submit a recipe or you just want to go have a look at the submissions and vote then definitely head over to their website once the gummy bears are set up you can pop them out of the molds and serve one thing to keep in mind is that the texture of these gummy bears is a little bit less chewy than gelatin based gummies what I found helps to get that texture is just to leave these out to dry a little bit overnight on a wire rack something about dehydrating them a bit gives them that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] [Music] thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video and if you

When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies?

back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to

"ZzazMbxC8kc": "yes", "1dld8NFfnB4": "hi guys so cuties today we're gonna draw a gummy bear so let's get started to draw this gummy bear working the first time I drawing the nose and mouth area so I'm just gonna come right here and draw a curve so this is gonna be a center of the bear so it's just a nice little curve and we're gonna round it off on both sides it's nice and even and we're just gonna draw a little curve that comes in to the center and back so it's kind of like a jelly bean so towards the center and come back down and then at the bottom we're gonna add a curve so they're just going to do the mouth area okay and then right here in the center we're gonna draw a little oval for his nose there okay so then we're gonna come to this side right here and give it a draw circle for the eyes it's around the top right on this corner let's sit here about right here I'm gonna start a hand same thing on this size about right here just try to point across [Music] [Music] there now let's make them draw sec UI someone come in here with two small circles for highlights and the curve line at the bottom then shade in the top [Music] and the lines at the bottom so same thing on this side [Music] okay so we have the nose and the eyes in let's come over to the side right where the eye is we're just going to give it a little bit space and we're just gonna draw a curve right here so but right here I'm just gonna draw a slight curve just going to right drag this point right across that bub right here so same thing and then from there we're gonna come up here you can draw the ear so from right here come in a little bit or you can start right here just imagine this line going through so whichever way is easier for you I'm just gonna imagine that going through and about right here I'm just gonna give myself a little gap and I'm gonna draw a curve all the way over so if you're using a pencil you can just go all the way across and then you race that part later that's easier so we're just going to draw a curve right across so now we have a space for the ears and it's down a little bit more so in here we're just gonna draw a curve for the ears and same thing on this side all right there make sure about the same level and we got a little ears in now we're gonna come over here and tuck this curve in a tiny bit just to define the head area in the neck where it starts ok so then now we can come down a little bit more so we're gonna start to draw the arms so just pop it out a little bit more not too much because gummy bears are pretty compact so from there now we can come and straw the hands so I'll just do this side first so then we can now draw the other side a little bit later so I'm just going to bring this in and curve and come in so let's just same thing on this side so let's see here come down so let's give ourselves appointment drag this right across and above right here in the center area so I'm gonna aim for that point and then once again round it off man I'm going to end at this point about right here then connect okay so now for the body area right here we're gonna come in a little bit just trust slight curve on both sides so we're still keeping it pretty compact and then from there now we can draw the feet so come out a little bit and right here we're just gonna ground it off all right there start to bring it in and go all the way around oops okay and then same thing on this side there's just some days my hands don't work everything goes wrong so high right here okay and then I'm gonna bring this up just like the other side [Music] they're now in the center right here we're just going to add a little curve all the way across and then because this is my Dras acute gummy bear and we're going to come right here and add a little heart and

you're gonna get G fuel energy gummy bears coming soon now it's April Fool's Day it's April 4 it's April 1st but wait don't click off yet because I'm telling you if this is this is they're totally punking us here they're totally tricky guys I'm calling it I'm calling you out G fuel I'm freakin calling you out because I want these in my life I need these there's two things I want to address before I even tell you the one piece of information I'm gonna tell you in a minute that I know that these are coming because they made a little mistake and it's possible that they could have done this on purpose but I'm not conspiracy that I'm conspiracy that it's gonna come out we're gonna have it and that's what we're gonna talk about so these pictures that they keep showing look to 3d rendered the actual gummies themselves just look so fake okay that I can't it's hard for me to believe that this is legit the even the packaging of this looks somewhat fake it looks real but it looks like it's just a little weird the fact that there's a little F up here for the face comes phase bear phase bear phase berries just seem so weird but at the same time this is such a great limited item that they are gonna that they could bring out I know it says limited edition there's so many reasons why I feel like this is fake but but now I have to show you why I feel this is real I have to tell you here it is so I was looking online for pictures right well here's the thing four hours ago before they tweeted they tweeted an hour ago four hours ago they uploaded this this right here you're like then what is this this is just the picture that you can see on here this is that's what this is yes guess what they dropped the price through the price of it that's hidden you can't tell what the price of it is because when you're here obviously they're hiding it so if this actually does become a thing it's gonna be 15 $14.99 so you're vid why why does that matter because I freaking wanna bro I want these things so bad I love gummies that's like my favorite can like anything gummy is my favorite and the fact of the matter is that for over two years now I've been saying if G fuel came out with a gummy product it would succeed there's nothing more annoying to me then drinking's like 4g fuels and just holy going to the bathroom every five minutes to go pee because i'm full of liquid and these would give you the energy you need to Gamewell have energy and not have to get up to take a bathroom break every 10 minutes so it's honestly the perfect product that they could come out with and I really hope that this is legit their of Twitter is all totally just blowing up with all sorts of stuff like this I know it's April 1st I know I'm gonna feel so stupid tomorrow when they and now and said it's fake it's not real and maybe tomorrow comes and they announce that it is actually going to be coming out or they don't say anything about it and a month from now it comes out limited-edition just like their candy did they already have their hands down bling and candy a little because it is considered candy so I don't man i oh yeah guys I really hope this is legit if it's not April Fool's I guess but G fuel gummy coming soon maybe anyway everywhere sure day I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "b8C3Phk1f9g": "what's up guys this is Mike and I have some great news for you so recently online there's been some great reviews about some sugarfree gummy bears do you have a right um you should take them out in the link in the description people are pretty upset apparently there's something in the sugar substitute which is whether sugar free that acts as a super laxative they depict themselves on the toilet for over seven hours with terrible diarrhea and I thought hey why not buy some so I did here they're the sugarfree gummy bears as you can see half the bags already gone now I've already eaten over almost 80 of these yummy bears that's like half the bag the people in the review say that they only ate 20 and they had severe effects now I'm not really feeling anything yet which is why I ate almost 80 of them I wouldn't have eaten all those if I figured yeah I'd be pooping all night but I wasn't really feeling the effects so I figured hey I must be some kind of strong stomach to person so I ate a lot um I think I'm starting to feel it this is probably the worst ever cramps and gas and everything Oh scene is inside me Oh God oh my god", "6tjwNDYi9Lg": "hey guys it's Mariah and today I'll be showing you how to make your own gummy candy or fruit snacks at home this is a super simple two ingredient recipe which you can make for your kids for their lunchboxes for parties anything really it's super healthy or natural and can be vegan so I'm gonna show you how to make it you will need 1 cup of fresh fruit juice and a squeezed store-bought it's really your choice also three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or if you're vegan agar agar or Vegeta which is a plant-based gelatin these are optional you can use honey as a natural sweetener your juices sour or vitamin C or citric acid for a sour kick and ulead silicone molds or ice cube trays or anything to form shapes for your gummies let's get started so before I start I want to show you the molds I'll be using these emoji molds look super cute but the thing is they have small indents which won't go very well with our gummies so if you're using a mold like mine try skipping it and using a mold with deeper indents like this animal one because deeper and then said to show more also these hearts are super elegant for maybe parties or something but yeah this is the juice I'll be using it's strawberry juice which also happens to be vegan although you can make your own so you know that it's super healthy and here's my gelatin powder again you can use agar agar powder or flakes or Videl I'm going to start by measuring out a cup of my fruit juice I'm pouring that into my saucepan but before I put that on stove I'm going to sprinkle in three tablespoons of gelatin if you prefer your gummies to be harder like the store-bought ones go ahead and add another tablespoon mine turned out quite a jelly-like almost so go ahead and add another tablespoon so you just want to let that sit for around three to five minutes until most of it has sunken in and after it has done that we are going to transfer it to our stove on low to medium heat and mix it up until all the gels and crystals have been dissolved into our liquid and you end up with sort of a syrupy looking consistency also make sure that it is warm and not boiling as you can see we have some bubbles going on so you can either skim off the top with a spoon or you can pour them in your moans and skim them off which is actually easier if you pour them in share molds and give them off but more time consuming so you choose then I'm going to transfer my silicone molds onto this tray for easier transportation now all you have to do is pour in your warm syrup you don't need to let it cool otherwise it might sit so just pour it in it's not going to damage your molds you and once you pour that in put those bad boys straight into the fridge for around 45 minutes to an hour then they're ready to be popped out we have smaller molds like the emoji ones I'm using be careful with those because they will break and you can make like cute little intricate plating design like I did with the hearts we can package them or do whatever you want and give them to your friends or family make sure you store them in the fridge because it is gelatin and it can melt in the hot room and as you can see the emoji ones do have some small designs and they show when I reflect them in light but the deeper indents like these animal ones are so much better Wendy I hope you guys enjoy this video I hope you found it helpful if you did have that like button subscribe and tell me what is your favorite gummy flavor thank you so much bye guys", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a like comment or subscribe it really helps me out and if you like the hoodie you can find it on my website cured.tv

"76ZCi1QGZ6s": "how are gummy bears made so I'm rich are tell I'm a professor here in the Department of Food Science also instructor of candy course in the summertime gummy bears start with gelatin and that's that's the basis for it this has sugar corn syrup and water we're boiling it off to 240 degrees down to around 12% 10% water something like that and then we're gonna add gelatin to that and that's gonna be the that's what makes a gummy bear a gummy bear so this is gelatin it comes from pigs or cows hoofs and and skin and things like that basically it's just collagen that's broken down into smaller molecules all that remains for us is to add color and flavor and a little bit of acid this is acid it's a mixture of malok and citric acid just for the flavor so we're gonna add green apple flavors so we chose the appropriate acids to to match that flavor to make the gummy bear shape we start with cornstarch so what we're gonna do is make the gummy bear shape with this press board into the starch and then we're gonna fill those holes with the candy these will dry overnight and actually the starch will pull some of the moisture out of the candy to get to the final moisture content plus the gelatin once it cools will turn into a gel and the end result is a gummy bear so if you put a gummy bear in in a microwave and warm it for 10 seconds it shows one of the interesting properties of gelatin which is its thermo reversible if you warm it back up above this melting point it goes back to being a liquid the gummy bear flows and then when it cools back down again it's it resets but not as a bear just as a puddle so based on a chemical nature of the the gelatin molecule so the end of those protein strands when they when they gel they form this triple triple helix thing as opposed to another tighter type of bond like you I find in starch and pectin and so that when you heat it up those just uncoil and go back into solution and so you go back to being a liquid phase and then when you cool it down again forms that triple Junction zone again and becomes the squishy gummy bear that that we just made", "gFSm3tGZQgA": "hello iris Oh SOS here and today we've got some cannabis infused chuckles and some stoner patch dummies that have already opened people because more missus does my brain in and once not texturing but that's not over here nor there so let's have a look and so it's time to patch dummies I've opened up the red one and we've had a nice little looking side of it the textures absolutely bang bang swangs Wang you can taste the weed edits injuria but there's a real real strong taste of sweet sugary and then a kick of where these are very very nice one for you one for me I must admit these are very very nice next ones chuckled infuse gummy worms my mouth is watering to know that the oil want it though would you reckon they're just injected it or what or make them sour patch Tommy's oh wow I just finished to them mouth watering whoa let's have a look at these worms are saying then very tough taste better than the stone the patch dummies oh they're the winners involved at the choice at least two or go for chuckles the taste is more souvent and less explosive but if you do like your tangy bangbang and go for the sour patch Tommy's pleased our people I hope you enjoyed", "P6Tzf7Xy61M": "everyone in it so today I thought I'd shoot a quick video on how to make gummies and we made homemade gummies probably every week or two because my girls love them we in the morning have a couple of gummies with their coconut water not quite sure where that routine came from it just sort of developed so what I've done previously is made elderberry gummies which are an amazing immune booster and that's what we do in the winter to kind of keep their immune system up especially as you're going to preschool and daycare today we are making some cherry elderberry gabbi's and I thought I'd share with you kind of my muffin and a few different tips that I've learned through failing miserably a lot of times I do have a little helper today so first and foremost what I kind of do I'm running about adventuring I suck at it I do have a gummy blog coming in soon but the majority of the time I kind of just eyeball so over here I have my blend of elderberry dried elderberries cherries sun-dried Ella raised cherries raw honey and coconut water my tip with your blood you want about roughly one cup of liquid you want to make sure it is completely smooth nobody likes chunky gummies it's disgusting you also want to make sure it is super super sweet a little bit sweeter than you would normally make it and that's because you do dilute it with the gelatin mixture so you want to make sure that it's really sweet beforehand so it still tastes good once it's diluted back I have a puffy eating a strain give me one second here so you do want make sure super suit you - diluted then I have my gelatin and a really really big the last bowl I use perfect supplements gelatin I love it and I'll show you it looks like here so it is pasture-raised these gelatin I honestly I just I love it it works really well it's a good quality product it's just kind of what I go and do I use roughly a quarter cup of gelatin or like three and a half scoops I'm going to pour some really hot almost boiling water into the gelatin whisk as fast I kind of make sure there are no clumps so the reason I have everything set out ahead of time is because you need to move fast otherwise everything kind of congeals in it your mixing bowl and doesn't pour so the faster you go the better it is to make sure that you have everything ahead of time so I have fun I have my gelatin at my hot water you know pour it in whisk until no lumps remain for my mixer whisk is hard as fast I can and pour immediately all right in terms of liquid I pour just as hey mom used to mix first right I pour as much just to make sure that it is fully dissolved so I'd say maybe half a cup so I'm gonna pour that in and I'm gonna whisk and as you see it already kind of starts to gel and get super super sticky on your pot so that's why you have to go far faster than you would have ever thought or I would've ever ever thought and you're trying to get it foamy and making sure that everything is dissolved so as you're misting mixing you're pouring your cherry mixture yeah I'm just a bit before so whisk as hard as you can you can already see it kind of getting a bit sticky sometimes if I find it a little bit sticky okay another tablespoon of water since then it out and then you form well let's do the gummy bears first so then you are just pouring it into your molds now typically I am terrible at this I'm really good with the bigger molds but these little bears are tricky so I prefer personally prefer the silicone molds but I do have a couple of girls who like actual gummy bears don't you these are my last resort runs I also really like parts now the other tip I have is even though these molds are fairly deep so if you actually look they're above inch deep my measurements are awesome don't fill them all the way and that's because really thick well my girls anyway you don't like super super thick I mean they like a little bit thinner so I try to keep it fairly thin and not fill them all the way what do you want circles okay we also really like circles so I'm gonna pour all of these in and I'm just gonna let them sit in the fridge for about 60 minutes and then you can pop them out now this makes quite a big batch we go through a couple of day then that one okay we go through a couple of day but um the only lasts a week and a half to two weeks in the fridge so I actually freeze half my batch and then just take them out and throw them in line okay plate down and then just take it out and throw them in a jar no look you can dip after so I would recommend freezing them if you're not gonna use them all but just remember my tip to make them a little bit sweeter cuz we've done that in the past where they're not as me and nobody likes not sweet gummies my other tip is to not add too many crazy things I won strengthening when I put flax or something in not delicious same with there we go see it was coconut oil or coconut yeah no we're out coconut milk makes a creamy gummy and for my scenes nobody likes creamy gummies just stick with a water base I like coconut water to get a bunch of electrolyte stick with a water base keep it really really simple few ingredients and use a quality sweetener I use raw honey because in the winter it gives a great immune boost to the girls and this bringing up some use to the local pollen so they're all corn all I'm gonna do is stock them toss them in the fridge and they're good to go with or some may have little fingers in them but otherwise they should be delicious so if you're making your own gummies good luck let me know how they turn out hang on and if you have any questions just drop them and let me know enjoy", "1Ny4Ug1SuzE": "years [Music] okay guys who are we and what are we making today gummy yummies cool I'm mama Queen what's your name Dan the man it was gel and data King daddy paint

about five dollars in the gelatin and of course then water is free and I was one right who wanted to get it okay thanks for watching subscribe to pit crew give us the thumbs up", "uIPRrcxet6g": "g'day guys and welcome today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "ynHOHttNH0o": "[Music] [Applause] so Jalen is going to tell it you what we're making today we are making album baby

quickly not like you don't want to make a mess with it but you want to stir it kind of closely together it's all mixed we are going to mix the half cup of hot water and which is right here and you want to make sure that it's not boiling water just hot water and then we started with a whole cup of elderberry syrup we are going to take the rest of the other berry syrup and pour it on in with our other a mixture your line makes sure it's blue is it yeah oh it is oh oh they're very sharp it's very expensive yes you wanna make sure you get every drop okay all together [Music] good job and you don't want to spill it cuz it's really expensive after they are all started and your mixture is smooth you're going to want to take your silicon trans which I bought little bears but they have different designs and the new dropper and drop them in up to the top and then you're gonna want to chill in the fridge for about two hours until they Harden then you can enjoy a lot of people just use you know like a bread pan or something there just pour their mixture in there and chill it and then cut it into squares and that works too and when you store these elderberry gummies you can store for up to a week and you're gonna want to put like parchment paper between the layers so they don't stick to each other and things like that but yeah if your child doesn't like just taking it by spoonful with the syrup or I just want a new fun way to make elderberry gummies I already want the benefits off the gelatin this works great so it looks like after 2 hours our little bears are done let's pop

so much for stopping by our farmhouse [Music]", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future

five have any fuel and the most unlikely of all the mythical gummy bear so we've got three different versions of our gummybear rockets those are gonna go into these four inch rocket casings inside this is a tank of liquid oxygen a valve and the rocket engine with the gummy bears and then the rocket nozzle those are all the major components that go into a hybrid rocket now if you remember it's a hybrid rocket because we're feeding liquid oxygen through our fuel grain and that's what this giant tank is full of liquid oxygen literally some of the scariest stuff on earth to say this is flammable is really it's not accurate cuz this is what makes things flammable it is the enabler for burning which is exactly what it's doing in our Rockets with the LOX and rocket casing ready to roll cue the first fuel have act gummies and that pretty that is gorgeous so the gummy bear fuel grain is going into its housing there are a lot of fiddly bits that all have to work perfectly in the concert snap rings o rings rocket grands housing and everything and it all has to be properly assembled with the engine loaded and locked it's go time for launch this is the pre-launch setup we mount the rocket insert the altimeter on the descent parachute into the nose cone and then erect guide rail reminds me of something after that we D asked the area here we go because just as our bomb squad so the only ones qualified to do the final capping in of explosives our rocket techs here are the only ones qualified to work with the super unstable liquid oxygen once they have the LOX in place they put in the ignition system and the countdown sequence begins it ends of course with me counting from five to zero and I hit the launch button the moment I do an igniter starts a little fire in the base of the rocket at the same time a valve opens up and liquid oxygen begins to spray down the middle of the core of our fuel grain it is ignited by that flame and hopefully also in turn ignites to fill grain causing a chain reaction of explosive force that since the rocket skyward system is armed theoretically this is it will hand-packed gummies bears be a viable rocket fuel to one there we go see any smoke Hey come on baby that's the lights out that's the sound of not working miss the sound of failure well we just fired our first gummybear rocket roar these were the gummy bears were just jammed into a rocket grain shape with no other modification and we got a successful firing which is we heard it burn and shoot out some fire and then we started to hear the telltale sound of gummy bears individually peeling a hoof from the rocket grain and getting pooped out of the bottom of our rocket but not with enough force to actually lift this rocket we didn't get any else we didn't get one inch yeah the ignition flame appeared to light the locks oh nice you're eating it me I'd still sweet Wow let the loos pack flavor some fuel simply fell apart", "BFThmrARMFk": "must be super simple three tablespoons grass-fed gelatin two tablespoons powdered erythritol like I said you can use the sweetener of your choice one quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and a quarter cup of water I've got it all laid out here this is the grass-fed gelatin now it's important to note that this is gelatin not collagen peptides so a lot of people will buy collagen peptides and be shocked when the gummies don't set up collagen peptides are not going to gel so you need gelatin and then so 3 tablespoons 2 tablespoons powdered erythritol a quarter cup of water I'm getting ready to juice these lemons quarter cup plus 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice then I'm just gonna heat them all in this pan until the sweetener is dissolved all of the ingredients are combined and you want it to kind of form a thick paste but you want it to still be portable and I'm actually not gonna pour it I used this little dropper and just like squeeze it into these gummy molds it's way cleaner whisk that together and heat it to where the gelatin is dissolved the sweeteners dissolved and then it starts to form kind of a thick paste but you like I said you want it to be warm and horrible you don't want it to start setting so we'll just heat got this heating over low heat I'm just gonna add the lemon juice water powdered or throat oh and the gelatin and then like I said I'm just gonna add just a bit so I've actually got it where I want it and I off-camera I doubled the batch up I decided that I wanted to make more while I was going to make it so you can just pour this right over the molds and then you can use a bench scraper tool to smooth it all out but I like to use the dropper so just feel like it's more precise and it's cleaner and then just fill each mold individually it takes a little bit longer obviously than pouring it but then you don't get all of the dried pieces that solidify on with a mold in between them gummy bears and we get more bears like I said I will link to these molds here you can swipe up to grab some they're super inexpensive they're silicone so nothing sticks to them they clean up really easily oops making a mess because I'm doing this well on camera alright so I filled all the molds I'm just gonna pop these in the fridge for about an hour and then I'll pop all the gummies out of the mold and they'll be good I'm gonna make a second batch also I have about some tart cherry juice for those shops that I wanted to make like the copycat vital proteins tart cherry turmeric shots so I'm gonna make another batch of these with tart cherry juice as well these are done I'm gonna put it in a jar give them in the fridge and now I'm gonna make now that the molds are all ready for me to use again I'm gonna make the tart cherry ones those will be a little higher in carbs but still completely reasonable per serving size cuz it's really not that much tart cherry juice I'm gonna mix them in with all of these super easy homemade gummies", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description below and also over on the blog I have some free

[Music]", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

you probably had it before also or some of you probably has never paid to stew it never seen anything ever but uh they're thieves right here BAM yeah they called Haribo gold bears and they've been out in the 1920 twos well since 1922 and these particular gummy bears even though they're in America they've been they're manufactured in Turkey so the name if you throw your off that's the reason obviously is not an American name and yeah so let me look at the other trician facts calories or 140 total fat is zero sodium is 10 milligrams total carbohydrate or 33 milligrams well 33 grams sorry about that sugar it's 18 grams and protein is 2 grams percent daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet let's get down to the ingredients the ingredients glucose syrup from wheat or corn sugar blue team text droids from wheat or corn citric acid corn starch artificial and natural flavors not surprised where else palm kernel oil caribou carnauba wax whites beeswax yellow beeswax yellow 5 red 40 blue one okay so apparently this is not all natural type of gummy bear there's not a natural recipe or anything like that whatsoever but uh anyway I'm just here to test it out so see what's about go ahead and get this bag open it says oh there we go it's just ripped in the corner whatever alright alright the pain guys you know the routine take a handful of these guys catch it yeah yeah got their mirror now right I had Anna frigerator yeah I didn't wanted to get all sticky thing like that so yeah ideally keep it in a cool dry place of course mmm I'm getting flavor I taste up on the bear he has orange raspberry strawberry pineapple living with all the flavors heads on the bag so I'm tasting I'm tasting a bit of pineapple a little bit of orange so you know a red one there by itself mmm okay so the flavor is there it's not strong which is more like a good thing you know you don't want to don't have a ton of sugar in there which is pretty good 18 grams okay all right so of course like Matt had a frigerator for a while so if you leave it on top of your fridge or in the cabin somewhere like somewhere dry and cool you'll get the flavors right away but other than that you can actually taste this a light taste which is not bad because ideally these are gonna be you know you don't really see the kids or whatever so you know with them bouncing all over the wall but overall what I recommend this to you guys to the people who's watching this video right now yeah I would even though there's a hell and there was now Organic of course but you know it is what it is guys nothing crazy in there it's nothing crazy in there I tell you that that's a good thing so yeah I recommend it gives you kids you know if you want to yourself your dope get yourself good your grandparents it's good enough oh I already I have had gummy bears in here so pretty important that these didn't suck huh that would motivate me to the team eating gummy bears but on a scale of one to ten I give it our way are you a nine yeah given I get a green one yeah give it a nine all right hurry Bo go bears which is 1922 guys check it out so if you're a candy person and now you like gummy bears and those another American brand was not American comfort are you so but if you had a type of brand that you continued she always had try these out not gonna hurt anything got this for it was 98 cents so a little bit over a dollar with text so can't beat it let's say you know four hours back so nice little slice of them snack on well yeah I totally recommend I'm um yeah keep it simple I guess mother fields coming up guys for those watching it liking coming up or thumbs up thumbs down all I want is your feedback at the end of the day you know it's not always gonna be perfect without me these bills to be perfect just a normal guy out here just making videos for you guys you know you want something be test it out or whatever it's never no no big deal I'll get to it when I can but anyway i'm on instagram at stroker underscore d follow me to follow back no problem and um let's watch the video I'll be like it stop", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much

gourmet gummies i bought these for my roommate so she ate some of them but she had some left over and i was like oh that'd be fun if i reviewed them so i taped the package back together and i'm gonna pretend like i'm just opening them they are non-alcoholic though i am a self-professed teenage alcoholic i'm just kidding i'm not let's open them so the tape might have made it a little harder to open than it usually would be oh they smell a little champagney there are two colors there's like a rose color and then there's like a yellow i think this one's supposed to be rose so nope so it doesn't taste alcoholic it doesn't even taste like rose it's just kind of sugar here's the yellow one i don't know can't taste the difference they both taste exactly the same taste like gummy bears they're just gummy bears don't buy these they just taste like gummy bears 50 cents at ebenezer is the most i'd ever pay for these which is what i did they're not low carb they're not keto they're not anything

Gail from a nightingales life so good to see you tonight I am making wine gummy worms and some crispy macaroni snacks Cheers so here I am making the recipe that my friend sent me wine gummy bears kind of excited so it's the instructions I have to put wine sugar and gelatin into the pot I'm using naked grape today first time I'm making this so you know it's me very gelatin so it's using nox gelatin I'm not sure what the quantity in these packets are like so I'll have to measure it out yeah it's about what I thought it was kind of fun I'm kind of like cooking when I'm not rushed you know kiss on your breasts it's kind of like wow okay so hopefully my stove will work properly today so instead of gummy bears I'm using I'm using the gummy worms thank gummy worms oh I'm gonna put the pink pink food coloring hopefully hopefully it will work cuz this is pretty old these welts and ones that I have I should get new ones but they're expensive I can't really afford the expense right now should probably whisk this actually andy dandy whisk trying to follow the instruction I think that works a lot better I mean that's all there is to wait for this to heat up like I said I really like cooking but when I'm not rushed it's like after work not with baking cooking that much just because you're rushed you only have the evening you know now I'm tired I think what I like about these dumb molds is they come with the dropper so that I am actually not pouring it over and you know I don't think there's but waste when you use a better tool at least I think it's a better tool so now I have to wait until so I'm gonna turn the stove down because we want to keep the alcohol in at least I think we do I was wondering if these would make a good wedding thing so we'll see should want to keep that whisk with me maybe so I'm not too sure how long I'm supposed to just check the to see if the burner is working because sometimes these are a little lucky I mean not Waukee enough to call the landlord or anything but just I don't know so yeah anyway probably cut all this out Oh I don't have a lot of room here so I cleaned off everything so one thing about this place is it does not have good counter space but you work with what you have so I'm ready so let's see mixture is very warm and it spits all over the place I probably shouldn't get got any of that foam but you know first try right I think this is gonna be awesome might be a nice idea for the wedding we shall see we shall see I really like these molds and I really like these eyedropper eyedropper to fill go there's like they came with like three one for every teller I will finish this and get back so here they are all filled see if I can get a better shot you can hardly tell but I'm gonna stick these in the fridge find a place for them in the fridge and I'll show you what the gummy worms look like after they are hardened so here is the finished product and I'll just take these out and you know gummy worms whoo I was watching YouTube one day and I saw a recipe for crispy I think it was crispy macaroni but that's probably not what it was called but I will find the link and post it in the description so basically take your rice macaroni and you put it in oil and it puffs up and so I thought I'd try it so basically the this this has to be rice macaroni it won't work with the pasta because apparently the pasta just hardness which kind of makes sense I have seasoning which is all seasoned and I'm using Crisco so let's take a look at whatever sorts are not so I'm going to put these in the in the oil and do it slowly [Applause] and see how it's puffed up it doesn't take very long at all be very careful around oil kind of weirds me out working with it but should be a little faster doing yeah it doesn't take very very long at all to I will take that off yeah and I'll just show you how it looks and a little extra there and I'll just let this cool down I'll let it cool down and then I'll put this evening on so I've put these in a bowl and I'm gonna pour this all season seasoning and try it definitely a crunch mmm that's a little ago I hope you liked the video I will put the recipes in the description and

if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you would like more vegan recipes definitely comment what specific recipe you would like down below and I will get on that ASAP and make sure to stay tuned until next Tuesday because we are making a fidget spinner recipe and it's so cool I'm actually making it today so haven't made it yet but it's gonna be really cool so make sure to stay tuned and I love you guys so much and I hope you have a fantastic weekend thanks", "fA-ARAwXYiY": "[Music] yo what is up guys you're watching tony's fitness here with another youtube video before i get this video as usual please like and subscribe so this youtube video is going to be about how to make super low calorie i'm very filling gummy bears like literally less than 10 calories so what you're gonna want to do is get this sugar-free i've already used half the sachet sugar free harley jelly or whatever whatever jelly all right see eight calories all right per sachet so what you want to do want to put that in like a cup with warm water so put the kettle on and just put it don't overfill it i'd say about 70 to 100 ml over hot water and just put this in all right and then give it a little mix and these are super super low calorie eight calories per sachet and this is 11 grams so eight literally eight calories less than that so this is super super low calorie so yeah obviously get your hot water and put it in like a whisk and not a whisk like just some container and then what you want to do is you want to go to your freezer and get some ice cube things out and pour the liquid into the ice cubes all right into like the ice cube holders and then what you want to do is you want to put it in the freezer for about 20 this for a minutes to just add anabolic french toast and then once the 20 minutes is gone take it out and it should look like this all right so if you look like this they're not done as you can see oh god they're still a little bit wet so yeah just leave it for a little bit longer and this is super super low calorie like great for any cravings so yeah let's cut to the plate all right so once you look like this like kind of frozen kind of not so yeah just empty them out on a plate there you go guys dude these are thick as well anyway taste test and you can just like grab these like basic gummy bears look at that man it's good these are anabolic see we go and gummy bears they hit the spot try out this recipe and yeah peace out they are a bit chewy though", "pWYu7jNaeAk": "hey guys welcome back to another CBD video here on East Coast cream today I'm going to be introducing some exciting products to you by reviewing CBD FX I have CBD gummies to tinctures and what is called a chill shot there's so much I could say about this company right off the bat the amount of information they have on the products is seriously great I've been using an oil for a while that has almost no information about the extract contents on their website and I noticed a complete difference when taking an oil that has information on it versus an oil that doesn't the consistency is just there in comparison I do have a coupon code for you guys so make sure to stick around to the end I will be mentioning it and you can get 15% off if you end up liking what you hear definitely worth it my opinion so let's get into it so the first thing I want to talk about are the gummies these are like the best thing ever there are 60 of them in a bottle they are vegan and gluten free and have very simple ingredients which I love highly processed foods are so horrible for anxiety to begin with so I was really excited when I saw that this product barely had anything in it they have 5 milligrams of CBD per gummy and the serving size is 2 the label is super informative it tells you pretty much everything you need to know about this product before you ingest it there's even nutritional contents about the fat carbs and sugar which is the first time I've ever seen that on a CBD product they have it on the textures as well which is great I love the packaging I love how simple everything is pretty much just have everything you need to know on the packaging and that is it these are delicious absolutely love them the texture is great they have like sugar coating on the outside they've just like really good treat the two tinctures I have are the plus 1000 series in a hemp plus 1500 series these 2 teachers are completely unflavored so the only two ingredients you have in these are MCT oils and CBD rich hemp oils like I said before this has the calories and the fat content it even has directions a lot of people get confused about how much these bottles recommend this bottle says serving size one dropper which is the equivalent to one milliliter which is what most other bottles say so it's a little bit more user friendly in the instructions the flavor since it is unflavored is compared to other like waxes or concentrates that I've tried before so I do need a chaser for these though I don't prefer the flavor there is something sort of natural and refreshing about taking just a raw hemp extract yeah she's very earthy tasting and kind of bitter but I do enjoy it on some level after reading about the chill shot I realized how supplement and nutrient oriented this company is the chill shot has l-theanine in it which is an extremely important amino acid along with all the naturally occurring terpenes and fatty acids that come with the 220 milligrams of hemp extract 20 milligrams of CBD and a few other ingredients to make the lemonade I like how all the products state how much have oil is in it versus how much CBD oil is in it because those two things are not synonymous just because you have 200 milligrams or so whatever of hep extract does not mean you have 200 milligrams of CBD the flavor was a little strong for my liking so I mixed it with some water and it was perfect there's even a lab report for this as well which states that there's no THC in it so from that I known to take it during the day when I take CBD oils with no THC I get a very energized 2-foot was feeling and that's how I felt when I took this I felt very focused and very um not a DD ish sorry so if you guys were interested and wanted to get 15% off the coupon code I have for you is just East Coast create 15 I just want to thank CBD FX for sending me their products I think they're amazing and I mean the fact that they're obviously a customer oriented company I really like from the simple ingredients and the user-friendly packaging all the variety of things that they sell to I can tell they're a very moral and ethical company and that is something I look for when shopping for any product so it's really nice to see that in a CBD product so that's all I've got for today and I will catch you guys for the next one [Music]", "-GxeRNyloAs": "[Music] Kubby don't go too far honey all right zombie now we're currently it's set down in the gorge and the map shows some stairs straight past that sign oh my

They were all set with agar agar and it's pretty\nmuch the same recipe for them but I'm showing you different variations and how\nto make it. I have in some of them use a speciality mold but in others just use\nthe normal square dish and slice them up to make shapes so you don't really need any\nspeciality equipment to make this. I'm using agar agar powder here rather than\nthe bars and flakes it's the most potent form and I always recommend to use\nagar agar powder. The basic recipe is one heaped tablespoon of agar agar\npowder with one cup or 240 milliliters of liquid and then simmer for a\ncouple of minutes. They are easy to make but one place people can go wrong is by\nnot stirring the pan enough. So you really want to make sure you stir\nconstantly for the whole time in a figure of 80 so 8 then 0 just to make\nsure no a you agar sticks to the bottom of the pan. If it does sticks is bottom\npan then you often don't get enough agar agar mixture combined so\nthey might not set properly. My favorite is the fruit juice jelly sweets just\nbecause they look great with all the different colors and it's a perfect way\nto use that fruit fruit that's a bit past its best.

and today I'm presenting you with something but I had bought like sometime back and just arrived today and that's a gummy bear Clint yes I said gummy bear cleanse it's a seven day gummy bear cleanse that you do for seven days here's a little vial and underneath this has the days and there's gummy bears in there of course haven't tried them yet because like I said I got them today but it's by just wonderful luxury candy boutique sugarfina and they also wrote a personal note said enjoy the sweets Seraphina but um I was going to read all of this but if you rather go ahead and know more about it I put all the information in the description because it's really a lot for me to say and this is like the fact that they have what really surprised me was that when the package arrived I was expecting a small little package like this but it was this big giant box it's so much wrapping around it and I only get why they wrapped it in such a big box it's so it wouldn't get destroyed on the way here which is very amazing because nobody or no company ever thinks about really doing their items or inventory or whatever they're going to send out to a customer really good you know those other companies that have broken glass or not in a bubble wrap or paper and everything gets moved around well not this is not the case it was wrapped several times and it was perfect I was a bit worried that they would not get here in one piece and it would be melted because here in Texas everything melts but to my surprise it it arrived perfectly so I'm I'm really highly recommending this company they have they have like gourmet gummies and other candies like the champagne gummy bears made with Dom Perignon vintage champagne and I just thought I'd give this a try because I thought it was interesting and it was really good and I was worried that okay well maybe this might not taste good because it says that the Bears are made with apple lemon ginger and greens no official colors or flavors fat-free and non-gmo the gummy bears which is amazing it says do you know and they have a little fact here did you know sugarfina first announced green juice gummy bears as an April Fool's prank in 2016 when customers started calling in to purchase they teamed up with press Juicery to create the real thing and I try to order it before they went really fast so I ended up being on the waiting list and as soon as they were available I jumped right to it and these are the small little gummy baby bears and they have once just purchase on its own you don't have to buy all seven days but I was looking for a way to get healthy but also have my veggies and I don't like the way a smoothie taste so I'm giving this a try you guys let's see how it tastes really good and yummy oh man and it smells so good so yes I highly recommend sugarfina company they did such a fantastic job I would love to do business with them again there's such a great company and everything that they have there I want to get but I can't afford some of it and some of it well I shouldn't really eat my tight pennies so thank you for tuning in I hope you enjoyed this video give them a look-see and I hope to see you in the next video stay I see bye", "eCgLs3IYk0E": "[Music] and fries today I got my big mouth oh okay this is what a Big Mac looks like check it out it's not big enough we don't want the Big Mac

meat lettuce pickles okay I'm not doing pickles but we got cheese more button more meat and fries so I got this mode for the top of the bun this mold for the bottom of the bun I got wolves for cheese I got wolves for tomato because you know you can't miss out on the tomato on a [ __ ] burger okay Big Mac I need to add tomatoes your burger you don't even like tomatoes I don't like tomato but everyone likes Tomatoes except for me I [ __ ] hate to me but I'd love to me exactly the Big Mac these Tomatoes we got molds for the patties we got moves for more patty we got molds for the middle one and we got normal for the lettuce and last but not least I got some primal picked up every [ __ ] morning all right this better be enough if not I'm really gonna be disappointed okay I don't want like

it looks better with an Emmy my mom drew this and that's definitely not this do the comparison this looks like Whoopi and this looks like a Ryan's reason not to mention it might not fit on the box guys the box is so blessed so let's go through the GI Bill I bet Raghu lon Eli beeline so as you guys can see the pot is steaming hot right now we're gonna put half the band in each pot like so and it's already starting to solidify oh we're supposed to whisk it this is the small way where's the biz Rick it's not apologetic you can never have too much gelatin I don't know if your science teacher told you otherwise they were wrong wolf he's always right [Music] now that the gelatin is a bit warm we're gonna put the sugar into so we're gonna use half of it in this one this is enough to give you instant diabetes so what is high laid everything out on the table guys we are gonna have to fill all of that up with do you like be alive heal I'm feeling the rest of the gelatin is going in this one and you have to whisk it right away otherwise it will get higher the amount of gelatin I got could feed six hundred families you know throw the bacon and we're gonna pour it into each of the mold so we're gonna start with the buttons tell me that doesn't smell yeah [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] okay we got the top button now the bottom button so now that the top and bottom funds are good we're gonna grab the middle one oh my god that's uncontrollable it's leaking every why is the price old brown so when you [ __ ] up guys don't worry we're recovering I did that on purpose guys I'm gonna teach you guys what happens when you [ __ ] up we're gonna pour this into this well just a nice yellow fry like so there we go so while that gelatin is cooking I'm just gonna add some food coloring in each thing fries need to be extra yellow so I'm putting a lot of yellow food coloring just to make sure they stay golden yellow crispy McDonald's fries you know how they are I also got a little bit of icing coloring but this stuff is super saturated super concentrated you don't want to use too much of this otherwise it'll turn oh I forgot to tell you about that your stained that's it no no no 100% staying for a week oh my god my fingers are now tinted yellow forever it's gonna put a little bit of that something okay guys we got the brown icing sugar I'm not saying my finger Brown I don't want you did you [ __ ] him wave your eyes it does not clean it we got to be very careful with the brown guys oh I said I'm talking about okay got my strawberry flavoring we're just gonna be flavoring the patty strawberries super strong yeah it's super strong okay so you use it all right tuberous Robbie said to crush me oh it's all gone okay so for the button we're gonna do a little bit of pure lemon extract apparently it's not sour I don't believe it that's heat units our boat holy [ __ ] that's bad next one we're preparing the lettuce the tomatoes and the cheese we're going to need our pan dusting can you take the top off for me please I like that nice and oily there can never be too much oil there as if you actually made that we're gonna be making the lettuce you want the legs to be nice and crinkly oh that's a good idea where he's pulling it through the door how is he still pulling it so like I was saying guys we're just gonna need about this bigger piece for this okay we need this lettuce shape number one BAM that's that romaine right there that's that good [ __ ] she's a little bit of orange oh that's nice that's what I'm talking well that's that expensive cheddar cheese that you get from the gums actually dogs are not about expensive stuff quality it's quality you know it's part to be pleased so for the tomatoes we have red food coloring and red icing color we're gonna use the food coloring because we don't want it to be too red three dots of that should be good enough those are nice tomatoes those are really nice no you would not so basically now all we have to do is leave all these to cool down for like the next eight to ten hours but I'm just gonna leave them overnight for a full day so I can make sure they solidified and I will be back when they freeze tomorrow all right guys day two we are back everything should be gummy let's go to the washroom and check it out as you can see you guys I told I'm gonna put a sign do not enter a gummy inside so that's how you know shit's important yeah so here's what we got it smells [ __ ] absolutely delicious actually let's see how one thing is that's [ __ ] gummy it doesn't even look fully gummy but that is way more successful than I thought so now what we're gonna do is bring everything out to the table and make the DIY biggest gummy burger McDonald's Big Mac burger in existence I don't want any of you guys telling me I'm not the goat I'm the DIY gummy goo right and I got check this out this is like some thin plastic looking material the buns are nice tomato and ketchup are nice we're gonna start with the fried okay so Dustin's working on taking out the fries we're gonna take them out and then put them on a cutting board and cut them after that's the way it's gonna go they just can't break on us if they break up this it's about to [ __ ] swing down and smoke you in the head yeah anyways like I say hopefully they don't break on us please gummy just come out in one piece I need everyone to smash that like button right now if one thing breaks then basically were [ __ ] so give me all the good luck guys I'm not good with gummies you know I fail all the time let's plop this over and see what this bad boy is saying three two one no nothing it's not coming out this is not good right now oh it's coming it's coming it's coming when you just suction it's gonna break let's go look at these McDonald's fries just finishing up on the fries guys we hold the knife so it is just gliding in like butter this fry is a little broken by the neck but we're gonna try and MacGyver a way to fix this but at least these fries are flawless so in order to get the fries to stand up we need to have a backing behind them otherwise they're just gonna snap off so we're gonna use wrist the board that I got but the thing about this is I wrap the tape around it thinking it was a good like life hack but it's now stuck I pull it and my mom gets pulled with it we're pulling the wrong way we got it off okay so now we are starting with the bird the first thing we need is the bottom of the bun three two one oh let's go okay so the next thing on a Big Mac if we look at this cheese we're gonna put on some cheese nice lay it on so that it hangs off the front oh my gosh delicious next is the Patty three two one oh yeah look at this concentration guys it needs a magic Wolfie top that is a patty if I've ever seen one that looks beautiful the cheese on the front of patty god damn what is next on this boiler oh yeah dehydrated drop cake okay we gotta be strategic with how we place these now we need to go a little bit to the left because it's tilting a bit to the right more cheese align it with the other cheese some lettuce because you know diet Wolfie is still alive and well so here we go let's go let us look at that so I'm over here too even though the weight will do Tomatoes next quick little yay whoa Oh tomato god this is just getting more unstable by the second yeah yeah I'm really scared we are limited on time all that's under the patty we have another yeah but the Patty's supposed to go under the tomato you have a Big Mac right there how did you yeah the party goes on top really patty goes on top confirm that it's the last thing the hell is Hattie bun Big Macs also don't have tomatoes do they don't but my Big Macs I've tomato this cannot breathe hi this is it too many I say we go over there right a bit there's a good balance drop panicky the ketchup does not want to move ketchup done three two one will expand kick the table world [Music] yes we're just taking the thumbnail but the burger is starting to crack my mom is behind me and trip me it's all good take the fries away this is way behind the scenes overthrown there looks like behind you the fries in front of the price where the burgers don't panic you're good you're good 100% you can you see my mom my right arm is numb I'm taking that time now bro it looks beautiful though it looks good it looks great Oh still looking great all covered so guys check it out basically we have the fries these are definitely hard to like just keep up we have to put some support sticks inside each fry just to make sure they stand up but compared to regular McDonald's fries and the burger I mean there's not much else to say compared to a regular Big Mac anyways we're just gonna get a nice cut through the door any other nice burger I feel like once we start cutting it's okay it's not sharp enough you got a machete guys be very careful okay yeah good I'll give you a fried first yeah here's your fries I need to have a McDonald's try to compare it pretty good cuz I wanted I don't want to eat too much down there yeah it looks good oh my god it's not bad yeah take a slice people are you doing that's been said you would take a slicer boom got some nice slices I've ever seen one that's all you need neat ketchup you need tomato can't stands on me if you got a compare so that's a Big Mac those for real good the badge real quick it's all good right Barry actually what it's just so good oh my god so the white bunnies like 2d fruity then we put that in that that was actually blessed this one this one

he's the king of the [ __ ] massive gummies youtube.com slash just just a link at the top of description and I'm just to you guys soon with another bailer video and as always stay sad [Music]", "osFBjWt5iG4": "hey guys so it is such a beautiful day\ntoday I think it's like 90 degrees out which is the hottest that it has been\nin a long time it is getting me all excited for summertime and all the get\ntogether 's and the parties and so in today's video I'm gonna show you how to\nmake some rummy gummy bears but as a special bonus to go hand in hand with\nrummy gummy bears I'm going to show you how to make some vodka infused gummies\nand they are delicious and they all go together they're perfect for any party\nso let's go spice things up okay so the first thing we're gonna do is get these\nlittle party cups and just put them on a pan or a tray just so it's easier to\nhall off somewhere next we're gonna get our gummies and we have three different\nkinds so of course these are the tropical gummy bears and these are lifesaver\ngummies and the flavor is basically just tangy so after we get these party cups on\nthe pan we are just going to open their little bag up and just start taking the little gummies putting them right in the party cups but\nyou don't want to fill them all the way to the brim and because your gummies\nwill expand and that fills up six I have a few more left but I promised my kids I\nwould save these for them next we are going to put the lifesaver wild berry\ncandy in the party cups and I have to tell you these all smells so good oh my\nword now you can't separate them with colors if you prefer but you really\ndon't need to and this filled up seven because\nremember you don't want to fill it up to the brim and I did have to save a few\nfor my kids so really this would probably fill up eight and this would\nprobably fill up seven for the gummies and these are the small packages but it\ndoesn't really matter and then of course we are doing the sweet tart flavor and\nnow the sweet tart flavor if you can see they kind of have a little bit of sugar\ncoating on them all they smell so good as well and then just put them in your\ncup okay so now we are gonna add our liquor to our gummies and we're gonna\nstart out with our gummy bears and our gummy bears our tropical flavors so we\nare going to do tropical flavor rum okay so you want to make sure the rum is\ncovering the gummy bears completely okay so now we're doing the wild berry\nlifesavers so I chose a blueberry vodka but you can also do the strawberry vodka or the raspberry vodka basically any berry but I chose\nblueberry and so you'll just want to pour the liquor right over the top of\nthe gummies okay so the sweet tart gummies are\nlittle tangy so I chose an orange vodka but really you can choose whatever kind\nyou want okay so now you want to put your gummies in the fridge for at least\n24 hours if you have them in longer it's good because then their bellies get\nfilled with liquor more if you don't want to know what these are these are\nmudslide pudding shots I will link the video below if you want to know how to\nmake your own all right alright guys so it has been about a day\nand a half and if you can see the gummies if you\ncan see most of the liquid is not covering them anymore\ntherefore it has gone into the gummies that is a good indicator that it is done\nand you are ready to party oh man guys can you see these I'm super\nexcited I'm gonna try all three kinds for you so first we are going to try the\nrummy gummy bears and you can just use a toothpick or you can use your fingers it\ndoesn't really matter mmm good okay so the next one we're gonna try is the\nlifesaver wild berry time so good okay now we're going to try the sweet tart\nmMmmm that one's really good but a little tang you I like that one I\nlike a mom they're so good and if you can see\nthere's just a little bit of liquor at the bottom so of course when you are\ndone eating these you can chug the liquor down and they are so good and\nyour friends will love it you will be a hit at any party I hope you guys give\nthese a try and if you have any questions just comment below and if you\nwould like to see more videos please remember to subscribe to this channel\nthank you guys so much bye and see you in the next video"}
