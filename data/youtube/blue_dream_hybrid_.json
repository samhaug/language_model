grows on today's episode i'm super excited to show my first run and my 4x8 tent in my new house so everything that you guys might have seen in the past was at my old house and in this house i decided i'm going to do four by eight tents everywhere and i have some other size tents as well but this is all from clone all basically i'm going to show you from the cloning process all the way to the final yield so yeah hang out and let's take a look so i wanted to show you before we get started kind of what i'm doing here with the setup i have my fans i have uh the intake fans the outtake fans the carbon filter i have a spider farmer 4000 light on one side and an hlg v2r spec light on the other side so yeah it's pretty nice everything is nice and clean right now on my first run um you see there that little intake fan with a little cloth kind of over it i don't really feel like i need a carbon filter fan going in but i do want some kind of little covering so stuff doesn't really get in too much but yeah that's uh pretty much the setup for this tent for this run i was taking a bunch of clones off of this blue dream hybrid plant it's called blue hash or blue hatcheson it really is similar to a blue dream so i've been really happy with the results on this in the past if you guys have seen a handful of my videos you've probably seen this strain pop in and out but yeah i had this uh this mother that needed a bunch of defoliation anyway so i took a bunch of clones from this um the real way to just do clones if anybody wants to see how to do cloning i am not an expert at this honestly i failed this way too often but basically try to get like four nodes down and then do like a 45 degree angle cut and then put them into these rock wool cubes you can also also put them into a root hormone first which i uh do and then put those into those rock ball cubes and after about seven to fourteen days you'll see roots starting to pop out of these things they won't do anything for like a week to 10 days and then you'll start seeing the roots just start exploding out of them and from the rockwool cubes i just put them right into a solo cup once they start rooting i should say then i put them right into a solo cup and let them veg for a little bit before i transplant into a final five gallon [Music] pot [Music] from here really all i'm doing is just watering i'm using this little two gallon hand pump sprayer thing which is pretty pretty soft so it doesn't like disturb the plants too much well yeah they they really do like a lot of water with if you transplant with a heavy root structure already they really kind of transpire quite a bit so you can soak them pretty good and uh it's definitely important to keep the humidity pretty high i like to use a humidity dome to make sure the humidity stays like 80 90 percent and then yeah i mean keep them keep them wet keep them uh water them every day if you can every two days is probably fine if you if you have the humidity high enough yeah they'll start exploding [Music] so from here i just let them veg out for a little while in the solo cups i could have transplanted them into the final five gallon pots a little earlier but i just didn't i mean they got in there pretty quick anyway but um after that i just ended up topping them all when they kind of have about five or six nodes i would top them and that will let them bush out a little bit more if you want to learn more about topping there's other videos out there for i think i have one on that as well but uh yeah it's pretty simple stuff that's about all i really did for these things and then yeah letting them go from there [Music] as far as watering goes i would do water on monday with nutrients i'd water with nutrients on wednesday and i would only give it water on friday and then i wouldn't water again until the next monday so basically three days a week i would water i think i didn't ever really super soak the medium either i think that's a different way of going about it you could maybe water just monday and just friday give it like three days four days rest between but i didn't really really soak the medium i just kind of gave it about you know one pitcher of water about a half gallon of water on each of those days and sometimes on friday when it was just water i might give them like a pitcher and a half [Music] the nutrients that i used for this whole run were the general hydroponics three-part series i would uh just take these nutrients put it right into my five gallon bucket fill it with water and then hand water i ended up doing something a little different after that but i'll show you that later on in the video that being said this is actually the last time i'm going to be using general hydroponics i have not just not been happy with the bud density when it's all said and done and so i have been using nuke heads which uh they sent me some stuff for free a long time ago and i've actually really liked it so um the bud density that i used in the white widow uh was all nuke heads and that was like twice as dense as anything that i've gotten with the general hydroponics stuff so i'm going to be switching over entirely to nuke heads in my future grows however this one i wanted to use just general hydroponics and i have another 4x8 right behind this one which i'm using only new cut so i'm really excited for the side by side when it comes to that [Music] well we're cruising right along here and this tent is just getting filled out like crazy and i'm like i knew that i was probably going to be over planting a little bit in this tent but it's getting pretty pretty jungly in here so i did a big defoliation before flipping over into flour and i knew even after flipping them into flour this tent is going to be absolutely packed so you know i wasn't that sad about it i'm like i think it will be fine i'm just gonna have to really fight things like high humidity and mold and stay on top of my defoliation and maybe if i really pack out a tent like this i'm actually gonna have better results you know more plants more more yield that's not necessarily going to be the case though and uh you'll see why as this continues on it was really helpful though to defoliate every plant before flipping them into flower i give them pretty much a haircut at least a third of the way up the plant like pretty much choose the line everything below that gone so all that stuff doesn't really get enough light anyway and you're not gonna really gonna ever ever have anything that produces decently down there so that's the first thing i did before flip them into flower and as of this point they were looking pretty good [Music] from then i'm still just watering my normal schedule i put up this trellis net uh i knew these things now that they're in flowering are going to be growing right up into these nets into the lights so when you go into flowering from veg you can expect the plants to at least double in size sometimes triple in size as far as growing up growing height i also ran this uh exhale co2 bag try to increase the co2 levels in this tent not sure if it helped a lot or not but i know having higher co2 which it definitely did did have uh should increase your plant growth so yeah i'm going to continue doing that in the future too [Music] and from here they're just filling out like crazy you know you defoliate one week and the next week they just looks like he didn't do anything to him so i didn't defoliate here for a little while right now they're just growing up and up into these trellis nets they're not quite there yet but they're really close and uh yeah they're stretching out [Music] and in just three days they've stretched right up into it so pretty excited about this every time basically they start growing up and through the trellis net i just bend them over somewhere else put them through a different trellis net hole that's that's i'm going to do that as much as possible to try to maintain an even canopy well they're getting wild and at this point i'm like all right i think there's just so much foliage in here i gotta give it another good trim job so ended up taking all these plants out trimmed up a bunch of the undercarriage some more took a bunch of fan leaves off the top as well and uh yeah just trying to trying to fight the canopy to make sure that i give as much possible light coverage to all the bud sites that i can i'm always looking for ways to optimize things do things a little easier too so i ended up getting this like uh sump pump a little submersible pump and a 50 foot hose and a garden sprayer and i fill up this uh 20 gallon tub add my nutrients to it and then i just run the submersible pump right to my garden hose and then i can basically water all my tents with one hose and it's also an extended arm so i can like don't have to get way deep into the back of the plants and all that stuff you don't just reach back there and do it so that thing has been absolutely awesome like watering is one of the pain in the butts when it comes to this kind of stuff and something like this is just super easy i know i've talked before about like auto watering solutions which i'm not currently using i still think they're great and they have their uses but just with my setup i'm actually hand watering everything now but i made a lot easier on myself than filling five gallon buckets and hand watering everything just with a pot too so yeah i think that's a great solution if it's something that you guys struggle [Music] with for now just watching everything grow keeping uh things tucked in trying to keep the canopy as even as possible some of the plants are just growing a lot more than others there are a couple other plants in here outside of the blue blue dream so those are actually growing a little bit differently which i was i mean yeah it's something you gotta expect i guess but yeah tucking and tucking and super [Music] cropping [Music] you can really start seeing these flowers pack on quick though i was uh at this point in the grow i was like man i think this is going to be absolute fire it's like just blowing up and not much time at all so if they kept putting on weight like this i was like this is going to be a record harvest and um yeah we're super happy with what's what's going on [Music] also if you guys have watched a handful of these videos love it if you subscribe you can see a lot of these kind of videos coming up if this is the kind of stuff you like i'll be having a bunch more of these type of videos four by four auto runs two by four a three by three ten it's all coming up in the next month so yeah hit subscribe and uh you'll hit you'll see uh some more videos like this coming out soon and if you want to support me in any way any of the amazon affiliate links down below if you ever buy anything from amazon click one of those links first and uh it gives me a little kickback so it's always appreciated but a like and a comment is more than i could ever ask for definitely like you guys uh sticking with me and appreciate you a lot of people have asked how far away should you keep the light there's so many factors to that but the light itself is probably really dependent on it for these i try to not go closer than like 18 inches a lot of times some of the top buds that are growing up might be within a foot though so as long as they don't get light burned these things have been within six inches of these lights and get very minor light burn at most so yeah i don't know 18 inches a foot is about what i usually run [Music] well here's where start things start to get a little bit more interesting like not bad not great just something so i was leaving for a week in the middle of this grow didn't really know exactly what i was going to do i i had a buddy that was going to come over and water it but i was like hell maybe i can actually just really soak them and so i'm not too worried about that but then i was having high humidity issues this this tent was getting like 80 90 humidity at some points after watering and so i was like man this thing is just so full i'm not so sure that i can i trust i don't want to i don't want to leave these for seven days and come back to a big bold fest you know with high humidity in there and so i talked to a local hydroponic store owner who i'd get a bunch of my stuff through and uh he's super smart when it comes to growing and he's like dude just chop all the top butts right now like if the top buds are looking great and they're like only a week away from harvest anyway maybe two weeks harvest them a little early you won't be sad about it you're still gonna have some great big buds and then let the all the uh lower stuff finish up on its own after that and it's like that's genius i'll definitely do that so what i ended up doing was actually harvesting all of my top buds and i left everything else below that so this is what it looked like right before harvesting all the top buds they looked done to me i mean they were only about eight weeks maybe just over eight weeks some were right right then um but they looked finished they had like nice colors already coming through i didn't give them to two days of like darkness before i only gave them just a night before of darkness so that could have played a factor as well in how they finish up but they were still super frosty they looked really good and i'm just going to let the other lower stuff finish out from here and in about two more weeks i'll harvest all this well here's a lot of the top buds that i ended up taking and then um here is the rest of the plants after they got topped so let those things roll and hopefully all that lower stuff ends up getting a lot more light ends up dense enough a good bit more because that light lower stuff was not even worth touching at this point so definitely needed to give it some more time [Music] [Music] so i ended up having all this stuff dry uh while i was away i put it in this dry drying rack and i was going the next week and had this this drying for the week that i was gone so i felt pretty good about that and came back and yeah started trimming i did hand trim all of the top buds uh i was live streaming for man probably three or four days i was when i was pretty much hand trimming i would just go live and uh a lot of you guys would hop in and talk to me so that's really fun and um yeah i plan on doing that more i don't want to do more than just trimming but it's definitely easy to talk to you guys well there's only 15 15 people in there maybe um yeah it's a lot of fun so if you aren't subscribed subscribe so you can see when i go live if you ever want to chat i love doing that [Music] well back onto this lower stuff i'm really hoping these small buds start to take shape a little bit better and and really uh firm up so i think they're okay they're definitely very light and larfy so i'm not sure how much better they're gonna get because they have been shaded out a lot of this stuff has been shaded out not all of it there's still some pretty good sized buds on here but a lot of lower stuff i'm just hoping will turn into something usable but we'll see [Music] you can really see these fall colors starting to come through like crazy i have been giving them only water since probably week seven so yeah their nutrients are all used up and they're starting to just cannibalize themselves and uh yeah all these fall colors are looking really pretty [Music] well i actually really debated even telling you guys this i always try to be honest with everybody so i'm going to and there's going to be so many that hate me for it but i plan on doing a lot of production so this is a one-man operation this is just me and i needed to figure out some solution for trimming so i ended up getting this i i can remember what it's called some trimmer bowl um i will find it and i'll put it in the description below but i could do about five or six ounces an hour with this auto trimmer compared to maybe an ounce an hour to doing hand trimming and with all this little the larfey little buds and the um just small denser buds doing a wet trim with this thing it saves so much time did i get as good of a product as hand trimming no i don't think i did at all but if i'm doing i mean i can't be spending 40 hours every every week i'm just trimming either so anyway this is what i did for good or bad i actually don't think i'm going to use this again because it seemed to destroy a lot of the very small micro buds that being said i have some really high quality trim which i'm gonna use and maybe turn into bubble hash or just turn into oil and stuff like that so it's not like all is lost but uh i think the final yield actually did get kind of hit because a lot of the smaller buds just kind of got ate by this trimmer either way it is what it is a lot of people have been telling me i need to get this trim bag a a real-life friend of mine uses it and he swears by it and then i've had other you guys talk to me about the trim bag as well it's like 400 bucks for a piece of fabric you know whatever it's fine if it works it's worth the price but uh yeah i'm probably gonna give that a shot once i uh can afford it so yeah i'll i'll keep you up to date if i use some other kind of trimming method if you guys have any other way of trimming that might be cool and helpful and save time and not uh not ruin the bud love to hear from you guys as well [Music] all right so now to the good stuff for the people that skipped all the grow video because you just want to watch cool bud that's all finished here you go so ended up german all this stuff i have it kind of separated into my first batch of hand trimmed top buds and then all my other stuff which is drying in the rack from the auto trimmer [Music] did end up getting some really nice dried buds even off of the lower stuff so i didn't get all the biggest buds i just got the top bud so some of the smaller plants still had some really nice colas from the lower branches so yeah some of these looked really great as you can see here have my setup going and uh yeah just weighing everything up [Music] so when it's all said and done i had 13 ounces from the top buds so i have that all on the right side here and then on the left side i have all the smaller lower branch buds which were also right about 13 ounces so i got about half from the top and half from the bottom my um grams of total grams were 708 grams of dried bud and in trim a lot of that is pretty high quality trim i got a little over 850 grams of trim so gonna be doing a lot of stuff with that 700 and whatever grams of uh bud for this this size tent with this many watts is a bit of a disappointment i was hoping for about two pounds ended up getting just over one and a half and uh i mean my goal was really three pounds for this tent that being said it is what it is i am not going to be using those nutrients anymore i'm going to different nutrients i have the same plants going in a new 4x8 tent uh they are pretty much they're close to done two weeks probably they'll be getting harvested and i gave them a lot more space so they're taller they're fatter they're wider but there's also a lot more light penetration that gets all the way down and so it'll be a nice comparison to see like less plants in the same space just given more room to breathe is the like inner nodal difference something that makes a big difference because if they don't get enough light they're gonna be basically buds more spread out so you know it's all it's all process it's all just learning so i learned something i think maybe i don't know hopefully you guys did if not hopefully you enjoyed it yeah i think that is about it for now i do have a bunch of stuff coming up i am going to be talking a little bit more about my little three plant autoflower grow with the mars hydro ts 3000 and um i have my giveaway which is next week on the giveaway video i think is my last video if you guys haven't done that sign up for a free light there's kind of going to be a neat little twist to that too so uh yes i know just all you have to do is comment on that video on that 3x3 video so look at my last video and uh throw a comment up on there and we're gonna have something fun with that next week yeah i think that's it for now oh yeah and then i have a three by three granddaddy purple four plant tent that's almost done too so yeah there's there's all sorts of stuff coming up anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed it till the next time you guys take care [Music]", "XgTkuBi5-Zw": "[Music]", "xtba40sLaoY": "Bammer TV [Music] welcome to Bamber TV cart reviews a brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this video smash the like button think about subscribing and for everything else and weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "EqPfb_Pehxc": "what's going on I want to welcome you to and thank you for watching this video I also want to say how much I appreciate all the new YouTube and Twitter followers and remember you can always reach out on the comments here Twitter post or DM and snapchat for any questions you may have in this video I'm going to show you the baldor hybrid strain that I picked up from fluent in Tallahassee this is the version of the blue dream strain I paid $45 for this eighth and this harvest came in at 20 point 17 percent THC looking at the bottle they I noticed it was packaged three days before I bought it which was great and they even give you the actual harvest date which in my book gives you two extra brownie points it smells sweet fruity and a bit earthy to the flavour of it was just like it smelled but the fruity scent turns into a blueberry not a really sweet blueberry just regular blueberry this 8th weighs 3.56 grams the 8th weight being exact doesn't bother me at all since as you can see the dense bullets were trimmed perfectly I kind of did expect them to be this a nice since I bought the ham trend that level which is what they call the premium now now on to the effects I felt it was a faster onset and I'm talking about by the time I had like the second hit I started feeling the beginning of the effects Netflix was turned off and changed into the sweet dance induce the music couldn't stop balancing to the beat and loved it and I have found a new gym strength more than a week from now on the comments I also felt an intense urge of motivated creativity by that I mean once the music was flowing the urge to write this review and take all the photos kicked into high gear and I got all of it done with a smile on my face from ear to ear and still dancing left and right on my share my stress and anxiety were knocked out pretty far into deep space through the duration of the effects ooh ooh how I miss a really well trained well treated well harvested well cured blue dream I can definitely work a lot better on the strain stress from more keeps bouncing right off first their energy and creativity just long delicious I certainly recommend this train for all day and night use I would just try to avoid it within two to three hours before bedtime that way you're not laying in bed looking up at the sky I hope this helps

buddy quick tip Oh all y'all stoners a lot of people already noticed my people don't right but how do you check if there's or do you fight over it more and more like how to find holes in your blood one Army's in common way is looking for them right oh no when you can't really find it you and I would have [ __ ] the whole that right that would have flipped the whole let you trying to steal their something fix it right you can't find it all right well let me tell you something senator keep low key looks better all right so you blowing it and eventually you know fire every time I say fire with my man much I myself foot when I was little that's right when I was little those little toys that you buy and they say fire fire do this we just sold dance I want to say it's about two grams in here I almost forgot to review the week all right guys look so this right here has a beautiful smell oh it's strong the smell is strong man the bud is frosty oh man so yeah I've seen that already but let me just show you I wish I could see if my taste my but my taste buds there you go are like whack I know when a weed hits like a certain way like the south or just the flavor that leaves behind this one it could either be the Duchess I smoke because I tried a new Java champ not the new ones this is new to me because I already smoked those and I mean it kind of let the good taste and on the rap like really the bread left a good taste but the we good taste like what I hate it right now it tastes a little strong but anything bad but anything good you know mmm this is a I did make a little research I'm like I'm gonna tell y'all I know this for a fact I just this is just on top of my head I remember eyeful reading this I always leave it the information are pletely in the description so go read that go read that like it see it's all India if you need more information it's all in there but um it's like a sativa dominant obviously it's a hybrid it's a cheap Adame good for like you know getting chilled out relaxed but also as a day time we do you know isn't a time strain you can take it day time anyone like have you knocked out and [ __ ] but you don't have your relaxed relaxed you'll be chilly damn we taught minutes in and we all looked over but it usually takes me about 30 minutes about to take 16 I say all these time but the times don't really stay on the video because you know it gets edited it gets cut out 7-eleven should like let me do it out for them or not bad but I sponsor me I'll be like go to 7-eleven and get your new hot chocolate median size for just $1.99 I think it's probably I'm already [ __ ] them I can't do it easily but I'll be like welcome to the new cafe where you can smoke weed and drink your latte no I mean like I actually do ads for their life with this mask on [Music] from one to ten how high do you think I am look you started your pout lovely there you go definitely how high but my reasonable bees we don't smooth the whole thing that is blue dream let me talk about the effects the low kill forget about well let me tell you how it feels to be honest the highest so pan instead the way that I cubed is like I feel the hair change I know I'm highest but I'm faded issue I can feel them higher [ __ ] the citizens it's so balanced it's just like it feels normal you know but your mood is definitely so like chill down as you can't see but you

two-month veg and I'm 30 days into but I took it under the grow ropes and you see that goes to [ __ ] right and looks like hell look at this [ __ ] thing man day 30 oh where does it 28th babe day 28 blue dream it's mother [ __ ] is going nuts I mean this is just this is one branch this has got one two three four five six seven eight colors on this one branch and this one over here has got one two three four five six seven eight and I mean you get up to here this I mean like said 28 [ __ ] days Cena's going [ __ ] crazy that's far enough that's a regular over Shawn bucket 5 gallon bucket don't look at the size of this [ __ ] she's sick and I mean I got it I'm gonna let this go to probably 80 70 to 90 days anyways but yeah I just wanted to give you a perspective of the size of this [ __ ] plant [Applause] she's a beast like I said you just can't really just light another [ __ ] it [ __ ] in my icebox in my videos this is my White Widow which is way bigger than that one Bush you're not quite as tall this is the 28th two buds aren't quite as impressive but so pretty killer well it's a shameful plain I just have enough room for my in my veg here's the cannabis chair which I think I'm gonna bring out and do it differently hold on so chest I mean you can see it's button see the areas on it I did what I needed to do to not get it to grow too big so it stayed inside here MA you look how long should I get shot inside can't [ __ ] tell but [ __ ] engineers on this [Applause] but like I said it's [ __ ] blue dream I got this [ __ ] down pretty good or 28 days into but I mean okay this [ __ ] thing just focus he's just covered in [ __ ] trichomes hairs are almost clear I mean the whole [ __ ] plan dude down into the bottoms I mean sick as [ __ ] I can't wait to see how much I'm going to get off his [ __ ] [Applause] she's a beaut look at the [ __ ] size of the stock I'm a big [ __ ] TV I get pause like a [ __ ] bear I got all I did on this one with some low stress training and it's Supercross anything on this plant just to try up something different just by the low stress training as you can see inside here I mean that I mean this is actual this is actual top to the plant these are just like the branches that grew off you can see right this one right here grew off the main branch that's us up here the actual talk to a plant would be that one this one and this one and this one I mean by the low stress training it just makes everything [ __ ] explode and I mean I stand by this strain I got it from some douche bag when he brought to me it had [ __ ] a fits every type of bug you could think I was spider mites if you go back on my videos you'll see when I first started this [ __ ] yeah we've been having some light exposure and I get in here just for a quick second be you also go back on my videos to check with that hydro plant I started on my first a second terrarium video I mean this thing's gone [ __ ] crazy that's also blue drained but see back in here me this room is packed it's probably 4x6 and then she's [ __ ] gone nuts but yeah just one to make a quick video on this [ __ ] blue dream like I said I saw I easily have two months left on this plant a month and a half not two months probably it said about 28 days in the bud I think is just going [ __ ] nuts I've got this feeding schedule down pretty good I got my pH but imperfect I test everything parts-per-million all beautiful I mean if you guys want any tips on how to grow I bought the box farm which I'm on doors but I use it Mike goes to and comes with a pamphlet I just put it on a poster so I can read through the potting soil just follow this [ __ ] man and you'll be growing [ __ ] mega earth so don't look at that how [ __ ] perfect is that lights out y'all time for these girls to sleep go up", "KWhHZXuMRL8": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a big bud of something called blue dream and I'm not really a blue dreamer meaning that this strand I know the strain very well I know what it smells like I know what it looks like but I usually wouldn't buy it but I did this time because this is by buds and roses this is their house flower and every time I go to the buds and roses they're cultivator is out in the back and he's hanging out back there so I I met him a few times and this time when I saw him I said I'm gonna grab some of your flower and I'm gonna review it and we're looking for the best so you know even if I don't rate it the best you can get some feedback and also make your flowers better or think you don't have to agree with me but we're gonna review Blue Dream by buds and roses today and we're gonna load one little scoop into vapor cups strong we're gonna tamper okay boom boom boom make sure nothing falls on if it does it goes back to the grinder and we're gonna stick it in and what vapor Cup does is just heats the flower to release the water vapor there's no burning the the vapor that comes out is especially if it's from hydroponic flower is smooth you can't even believe anything's coming it's incredibly smooth and so today we're gonna talk about blue dream you can see it comes in this jar and this flower had 20% THC and the one thing that I noticed from the beginning is Blue Dream has a unique take an excuse me a unique smell and a unique taste and this flower is missing both of those things it looks like blue dream but it doesn't have a standard anyone who's in the know knows what Blue Dream smells like this flower does not have that smell and you know I I didn't smell it when I was there because it was coronavirus they're not literally smell anything I just bought it because if I would have smelled it I don't think I actually would have bought this flower and but it's not about any of these things in the end of the day it's all about the something-something if it tastes terrible it's dry who cares it's got the best something-something but this flower for someone who's looking for a standard Blue Dream this flower does not have the nose as a part of a regular program it does not it has a look but not the nose so you can see we have vapor in the strong and I've got this cup set to 330 degrees I've got vapor in the straw so let's check out blue dream from Bloods and roses Wow so this flower makes a lot of vape I think you could see that oh my goodness it's got a light weedy taste this gave me a nice buzz but as a light buzz but it was a nice light buzz and that matters and we're looking for the best and I would say the thing that I thought that this thing gave me that was notable was it I had a wandering mind meaning my mind was all over the place and we actually like that tell you get creative thoughts but we're rating flowers were looking for the perma-grit smile we're looking for the best flowers in LA and in Las Vegas actuality and in Las Vegas also and what did we think of blue dream of bye buds and roses I'm giving this flower a heavyweight eight to five meaning it's okay it's good but if you're a heavyweight maybe you're not satisfied with the flower but I'm not gonna give this flower double rating I'm gonna give it a light weight 875 so if you are a light weight meaning you don't smoking every day you don't need heavier and heavier flowers maybe this is a good strain of blue dream if you like blue team eight seven five is a good store is a good score so if you like blue dream buds and roses really has a kind of nice feeling so I would check it out I'm the doctor if you want to try blue dream it's and buzzer roses in Studio City right now if you want to see paper cup you can see it on vapor cup calm and I am Telling You this is game-changing technology doesn't get dirty the vapor is smooth as silk it comes with a straw if you buy the combo it comes from the straw pack you can load these straws up keeps in the smells shut it up goes in the bag with the cup you're ready for a whole day of flower you can see it at vapor cup calm if you're looking for the best strains go to wheat entertainment calm it's definitely better than picking line and if you can find those strains like little stone you to the bone thanks for joining in on the dr. party on my friends [Applause] [Music]", "0Ee5Sw_W-4U": "thanks ivy vine for 23 and today we are going to be reviewing the blue dream stream this sativa dominant hybrid is originating from

bloated it was awful we're gonna try wearing low-rise jeans for a full week i've always been aware of the 90s trend of low-rise jeans but i was like a baby during that time so i didn't really partake i'm an older millennial i lived through the 90s it was awful i stuck to a very tomboy look because i was playing soccer and i was friends with the guys i didn't like latch on to a lot of those trends when i was a kid low rise jeans have become so popular again and i've seen it all over my for you page on tick tock but i've also seen some people talking about how when it was really popular in the 90s and 2000s it contributed to unhealthy beauty standards for me especially being a curvier person i'm interested to see how these jeans are going to actually fit over my behind i'm nervous i wear crop tops so it's not like i don't show my body and i do work out a lot so i'm very proud of what i look like but but the whole abdomen and below like what i don't think there's enough crunches and sit-ups in the world to prepare myself for this so i'm just gonna have to be excited we're going to open them up and see what they look like these are some cute jeans covergirl empower your style let's see how empowered my style's going to be in these jeans like i don't think we do ripped jeans so much anymore but that was so big in the 90s and 2000s they look like very 90s with the wash and details which is not exactly my style but maybe it'll look good i'm not as like freaked out as i thought i was gonna be i'm a genie in a bottle gotta rub me the right way these are like right below my belly button they pretty much cover the back these jeans are paper thin i went with this top because it's really bright it's really colorful it's very like bohemian vibes i feel like it's cute and it shows off the gene i feel a need to flex my stomach because it's exposed like it's totally fine like this but i feel like i have to do this the whole time i'm not wearing this out and about where i'm gonna be moving too much because i'm just gonna be hiking these things up every two seconds but they're not as bad as i thought they were gonna be what about the fact that my whole stomach is exposed well in america are you okay with me running errands with you in this outfit yes of course okay why not i think it's i was worried i thought you would be like oh cover your stomach no no those days are gone i definitely feel like a milf in training walking around my low rise jeans and my heels like i totally felt like a bad fish these are like a bonus pair because they are not only low rise but they are bell-bottomed as well so these are going to be fun if you get jeans off of amazon read the reviews because these are like it's like cardboard that somebody is trying to pass off as um being denim but it's not this is the boyfriend jean that's kind of like more baggy style that i saw on pretty little things this is completely different than anything i own which is going to be a great challenge for me style wise but also because it's the low rise it's still a big challenge for me because i get to have to get over the fact that my whole stomach is out for the world to see without me being in like a swimsuit at the beach we've got bell bottoms we've got low rise we've got a crop top we've got super 90s makeup and hair yes it feels weird i don't know i'm not used to all this extra fabric right here none of these jeans have been doing my ass any service this is definitely giving me like mtv era like i'm pretty sure a pop star of some sort would have worn something like this it looks like i'm going to a nightclub at the top and then a kickback at the bottom so i'm going to try and make it look like we're going to the same shindig they are uncomfortable and i am pulling them up every two seconds another reason why i don't wear these jeans is because of this back situation like it's always messed up and felt always like break right in the middle because i just have too much ass for jeans like this i decided to do my hair and makeup very 90s very dark lip liner with the frosted center and the uh black eyeliner and the middle part because it's so useful what do you think of my fit in my low rise baggy genies it feels like it's 1992 again i'm over here just like what on earth what is going on with this tlc looking what on earth is this where's these where did these jeans even come from [Music] these are so thick and like so stretchy i can already feel like the given them so they're going to be great around the waistband they have sizes that you know like stretch across the board they're very size inclusive so it's like a gray denim wash i'm curious how low these will hang like are these going to be hip huggers like are they really low rise they are the best quality jeans that i've tried on this week um i don't even need a belt when i have them on i trust them they fall at an appropriate length this is how i got into these jeans it was a lot of this a lot of this a lot of this it's a miracle i didn't break one of these little belt loops because i literally this was me this was me getting into the jeans today i know before i was complaining the other jeans maybe look like i had no butt but this is giving me like beyonce beauty but without the real movie like this is actually like increasing the little bit of nerves i had this morning about oh my gosh i'm bloated and my stomach is out now my my stomach is out and skin tight jeans that are crushing my spirit i'm working from home i am definitely more relaxed in my style today just have like my usual hair up and put a little something on my face something on my lips but nothing too crazy nothing too 90s so as far as this style option i really like the color combination of the jeans and the color of this crop top to spruce up this outfit i added this necklace which i love and then i took this piece of fabric which is i don't know just like part of nigerian traditional attire and normally people wrap it around the race kind of like a skirt but i kind of made like a little bolero jacket situation out of it wearing this i feel a little bit more covered even though i'm still exposed and i feel like it's a cool popping outfit so i love these jeans so much from the other day i decided to wear them again today this is my style it's like pop of color it's comfortable these jeans are cool the best out of all the ones that i've tried so far so i'm really happy with these i have my scarf we're gonna figure out some way to style this slowly coming together whoa i don't hate it i kind of like it it's kind of it's kind of regal i have the black belt on now they feel great it's still giving me belly button vibes but i wore like a crop sweatshirt this time just to pair it with something a little shorter and to give the waist a little love just did a big curly bun and tried to do something with my baby hairs i think it's really cute it's different it's not a typical scarf top style and i'm into it i think i'm so into the scarf top that i am not self-conscious about the fact that my whole abdomen is still out it's day five it's day five it's day five and i am getting myself ready for my best look of this week i think i'm gonna lean heavily heavily into bratz doll inspiration so when i'm styling everything i'm trying to like be really 90s about it and i've been like going back in my yearbooks and my old pictures and finding things that i used to wear when i was a kid so i am going to be wearing the baggy jeans again they were my favorite jeans of this whole entire week and y'all i got the beyonce ivy park icy park ski tag sports bra i am going to try and go for like a sporty look but look we got we got denim on denim because i have this upcycled style denim jacket that's cropped so between the cropped jacket and the low-rise jeans it's going to be a situation i love the news boycap the big hoop earrings my little curly pigtail situations i love this sports bra it is so cute in celebration of my last day i wanted to go with something like really far out really like otherworldly so it's like alien themed today my roswell shirt and my alien tims i like to call them i don't know what they are but they're just like amazing i don't even know what these pants are but they are not cute they are not flattering and they're probably not staying on for long so this is my low rise it's got like the nostalgic low rise but also the like the gen z bagginess of it if that makes any sense so it's like it's crisscrossing the two generations which is really cool these are my favorite jeans i gave them five out of five they're comfortable they're low rise they're completely out of my comfort zone i would have never bought anything like this before and i feel like i'll wear them again over and over and over and over and over the jump back in time and like looking at old photos and trying to style everything with like accessories and 90s and even doing like my hair and makeup like i used to as a kid i enjoyed going back in time the hardest part of this challenge was definitely getting over my insecurities about my body but you know we only get one body so you have to learn how to love every inch of it i can say especially after this week i do [Music] you", "qQOFYMwd8R0": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today carl today i'm very very lucky to have a friend that works at bmw he has given me this x5 i will show you in some seconds they called 45e it's the same engine that i tried on the 545b so today i'm going to show you how this car looks and giving how the car is to drive and giving you how the look is different from the previous xy we tested some years ago let's go so here is it guys the new 2021 x5 45e this car has been some dramatically changed over the few years you can see here that it got new 20-inch wheels that looks really beautiful on this one it has the charging port that has been shifted with the m i don't know if it's the uh it follows with a car or if someone has just put it on but i think that's something just came with the car the front has been also reshaped with a much bigger grill and i think the grill looks really okay on that kind of car that is so big you have also you can see this front bumper it has been reshaped with a bigger intakes on the top there and the air will pass much better with that it has also closing winds when the engine gets hot it opens automatically i think this car also have the normal headlights i i'm not sure if this car has this laser lights but it looks like it's the normal ones do correct me if i'm wrong please from the rear it has been changed quite a lot from the previous car uh it has got a new exhaust tips it has the new diffuser and a new i'm like much wider uh from the previous one new headlight that looks pretty good okay but could be better if i don't and i can see already it got some water inside i don't know if it's something normal with the bmw right now because i'm seeing this uh pretty much over the new cars because if you go ahead after the headlight i could also see some water on the headlight somewhere i think yeah that's the one i was trying to show you you see i think it's water inside this headlight and i think it's a strange design that i didn't have fixed from the previous problems they have had with the headlight and rear lights let's go over to the comfort seats interior this one has the comfort seats really beautiful and i think to be honest this is one of the best seats in the world i have tried these seats on comfort seats under my 5 series but something with this fire x5 is totally different it's so good that you can sit in this car and drive for hours and hours without being tired of that these cars also come with the harman kardon sound system that sounds really pretty good friend has also the new informant information entertainment system with id7 it also have the new cluster before i didn't like that cluster that more but when i look at that this weeks this looks really beautiful and starting to like it's really good so i'm thinking i will retrofit this kind of uh cluster to my 530 that i'm going to rebuild later on the car also have this new a-speed gearbox and the quality of everything that is in this car feels really quality built you can't hear any squeaking noise when you try to press something on the car all in all this car has the power it has electrical engine that does almost 60 kilometers on only pure electric and uh showing how heavy this car is and i've been driving this really good and hard it shows that the tank will drive 258 kilometer without having any battery considering how much weight this engine has i think that's really pretty good and i'll do some videos later on to show you what how the car responds when trying to put full response on this car you also have a very good place in the rear seats and a good place for your knees so the car has been some upgrades since last xy so i think this is one of the best places you can have on the car [Applause] now if you see i'm trying to sit on the rear seats and i'm 180 tall and i still have a lot of place without having problem uh and sitting in the rear i have been driving this car now almost for one hour and um i have a really problem with the back when i'm driving but with this car i really say i can't feel any harm in driving at my back the seats are so good that i can't have them seats on any bmw i hope uh they will set those seats on every bmw because they are so great oh sorry i forgot to set my seatbelt so i will just put my seatbelt on again i'm driving this car on pure electric now and uh the sound is really good and feels really comfortable when driving on this road i tried also the ix3 in the previous videos and either ride was really harsh but while driving this x5 this x5 feels so much better it's just something else i have tried out of this car when you're driving on uneven roads that is normal on that kind of roads in norway you still can't fight anything on this car the ride is really smooth and all and even roads you don't feel at all you sits really high on this car and i think beside this 545e this is also one of the best cars you can buy it's really different cars uh considering the space and how they they are looks but it has the same engine uh as the 5458 bmw has done really good things with this cars as you see you got this inline six cylinder engine called b58 in this x5 and even if it's a really heavy car uh this car feels really really punchy and not the same as this 545 i tried some weeks ago but still really good power and fuel economy uh we need to consider it how heavy this is from their previous x5 so what i will do right now is to put this car on sport mode and i will have a look how this uh pulls from like i'm driving 35 kilometers per hour and i will do like just a quick response to see how it's really respond that's right yeah you see how this car pole since i have a really beautiful sound and uh a really smooth power when you pull but as i explained earlier it's not the same punchy engine that you feel sits in the 545 but i think that's because of the weight this car has in total this now i'm driving very normal and then not pressing the pedal at all but this car just feels like it's going uh by itself and i'm drying really soft and now i'm driving at the highway and it's unbelievable unbelievable now i'm driving this car up to the highway and it's unbelievable comfort uh when i'm driving this they feel so smooth so good and the fuel usage is so low because of the heaviness of the car and when you're sliding it downhill this car will go and charge by itself while i have been driving this car for some few minutes you can see the car has been charged up to four kilometers already that's really good to be honest because i'm doing just 85 kilometers per hour and the fuel economy is also be going up considering this older generation f-15 this car is miles ahead in comfort and the seats are like i don't know how to explain it you have to test you by yourself to understand what and when i see these seats are just superb they are just great best seats you can get in any cars i think this kind of car that you i'm driving today is for the weather when it's really winter and heavy snowing uh this has the four wheel drive and it will be the perfect family car if you want it it has the big space in the rear and the boot is really big if you have like dogs and i'm going to skiing this is the perfect car you will have uh for the family and considering this engine is hybrid so will this card not cost you that much if you would have bought x5 with a diesel or fuel engine you will save a lot of money when you buy this engine and if you see uh in the how norway is doing in the electric fashion uh for the cars so [Music] i think you will see many many cars with this engine rather than diesel and fuel benzene engines um because you get everything you need in this car you get the electric engine uh aside uh mentioned early in the videos with a 545a that if you are doing driving short roads like from school to your job that is not so far you can drive this car on pure electric engine that will do 50 to 60 kilometers that's really good and will save you huge amount of fuel and of course it's your money while driving this powerful engine i know this that the the charging of this car uh while driving is much faster than my 540 530e in the previous from 2018. bmw have done dramatically changed when they know um the previous hybrid car was not that good because what happens with the older generation of hybrid cars that whenever whenever the electric engine the battery was finished uh the car had gone back to the normal dry so what it means the fuel concentration just went to the sky it was like almost one liter while driving and that's really bad for to be a hybrid car so that's i think the reason bmw changed the hybrid system on this cars that fast so for this reason i think uh bmw has done a really great job uh considering how good this charge and the your economic fuel economy you get in this car the car is at standstill and uh a bit upwards so what i will try to do 0 to 100 to see how it responds the sound in this engine is really amazing i just can't get enough of it just just heard the sound it's really good you feel this punchiness and really smooth uh engine the fiber wave was much punchier but it's more soft when it even if you have this car in sport it's much more soft and comfort in this car is unbelievable to just explain how good this car is on uneven road i have been will drive this car on my face you can see a really bad road with very much uh holes in it so let's try how it will ex looks these are really big bumps in the car but unbelievable i didn't jump at all in the seats it's really comfortable while driving in this section of the video i'm just giving you guys have a look at the car without saying anything special so guys just have a look and enjoy [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

dry mouth dry eyes and paranoid for more information please visit leaf lecom", "I-kcS8vECeQ": "Welcome back this is Drew, owner of Connoisseur Concentrates, and we are back to do another Terpene Profile Breakdown Video. As usual I am joined by my Chief Lab Tech; Professor Matsumoto (What's up), my Media Director; Audrey (Hi), and we are here to do one of the most popular strains in\nthe world: Blue Dream. Blue Dream terpene profile that\nwe've created. Now if you don't know what Blue Dream is, I need you to turn off\nyour computer or your cell phone, and question why you're in the cannabis industry, maybe come back five years from now. Blue Dream is probably the most popular\ncannabis strain on the planet, whether you like it or not. It's controversial,\nsome people like it, some people don't, but it is what it is. Parent lineage is Blueberry mixed with Haze. And it is by far our most popular\nselling terpene profile, it is very good. If you are just starting out and you\nneed somewhere to go, that isn't gonna be a problem, and you need a good product;\nBlue Dream's gonna make it. We really nailed this one, why they considered it to be our best profile. You'll notice right off the bat that the bottle, right here in\nthe center, is clear. That's because this is in our organic line of terpenes. It is\npure organic terpenes, there's nothing artificial, nothing synthetic, terpene\nonly blend. First thing you're gonna do when you're in the store or you buy it,\nthinking of buying it, you're gonna smell it. So let me tell you what it smells\nlike. Smells like a mild earthy cannabis. There's no distinct flavors in it that are different from one another. It just\nsmells like good weed, quite simply. One of the things that I tell everyone in\nevery single video, because it is of the utmost importance; is you should never\nbuy your terpenes based on what the bottle smells like. That is a rookie\nmistake, don't be a terp rookie. I will explain it so you understand it. I explain it\nalways because it is so important. Terpene profiles like this are created\nfrom about 20 different terpenes. Now every liquid in life has an evaporation\npoint. These being liquids, all the different terpenes evaporate out at\ndifferent temperatures, at different rates. When you smell a bottle, you're\nsmelling it at room temperature. You're smelling the few terpenes that evaporate\noff at whatever rate they do at room temperature. That is gonna combine\ntogether and form one type of a smell. That's not the way we make these\nproducts. We make these products so that all of those terpenes evaporate out at\nthe temperature inside of a vapor pen, to create the flavor that we've done. It is\nanother level of engineering that most companies don't do. That's why our\nproducts are scientifically better. I'm gonna let Audrey explain that a little\nbit better to you, or in more detail. Right, so the most important thing to keep in\nmind when you are getting into terpenes, buying terpenes, learning about them in\ngeneral, is that that pen almost never tastes exactly like what the bottle\nsmells like. You need to know this because at the end of the day your\nclients are going to be tasting that pen, not smelling the bottle you have. That's what makes our products so much better. We've spent hours formulating these for the\nend-user and the customer, not walking up to the counter and sniffing the cap. That's right. I'll be honest with you, I would just forego smelling these\nterpenes at all, whenever you buy them. It's not an accurate representation. We\ndo not make perfumes, we make flavor ingredients, and those two things are\ncompletely different. Your customer will never smell your bottle of terpenes. The\nonly thing your customer is ever going to interact with is the pen. And what\nreally matters is what the pen tastes like, and that is a different formulation, okay? So luckily, the professor here has created a pen from the Blue\nDream, and he's gonna tell you the customer experience on what they're\ngonna taste like in a pen, the way we formulated them. All righty, here we go.\nTaste testing gauge. I'm getting a bit of a light gassy note in there followed by,\nsome would say, a floral note. And I can't stress this enough; it is a very,\nvery clean flavor, almost uplifting. It's crazy. That's right. A lot of our profiles are differentiated by whether they are separated profiles\nor combined profiles. Now a separated profile; you're going to taste those\ndifferent notes at different times. First you're gonna taste gas, then you're gonna\ntaste earthy, maybe citrus on the exhale. Combined profiles; all those blend\ntogether into one flavor. You taste it on the inhale and the exhale. Where's the Blue Dream come out? I would categorize the Blue Dream as a very well blended terpene profile. Meaning that you're gonna be able to taste that really clean\nflavor, that gassyness a bit in there, with those floral notes all mixed in\nthere, from inhale to exhale. So we have this designated as a light cannabis\nprofile, meaning that it tastes of-like cannabis. It's not a super robust G 13,\nit's just a light cannabis profile. Now that is different from how strong the\nactual profile is. There's the cannabis level of it, and then there's the strength of\nthe profile, in relation to other profiles. For example, six drops of this\nversus six drops of this. This may be really strong, this may be really light. So where do we fall under the strength of the profile? Blue Dreams, I believe, is\ncategoried into our medium strength profiles. The other thing we do is we base this on\nwhether they are enhancing agents or masking agents. Some of the products we design are created specifically to mask your cannabis, so that you can smoke in\npublic. Some of them were meant to enhance it so everyone knows you're\nsmoking weed. Where do we lye on this guy? Blue Dream is an enhancer. That's\nright, that's right. So okay, if you're interested in trying out the Blue Dreams,\nI highly recommend it, any sample pack you get should include this. I-truly, it's\none of our better strains.

if y'all can see this i'm gonna tilt so we don't lose any when i first got this this was really green i could see the reds the yellows oh you could really tell this was a good quality one i'm trying to scoop it all back up in there yeah and i'll show y'all what i do with mine this is a good hit one i'm honestly gonna go back and i'm gonna buy an eighth and put it up on the shelf um because i'm having trouble when it comes time for the ones that really work for me i really have problems keeping up with them and i know uh plants die and everything like that so but i will show you the two devices of course you all know the metal pipe that we have that we always test with then i have my one hitter but we're just going to use the pipe today i want to see the actually we might as well just use both of them because i want to see my react i want to see the different flavors that come out of it and yes there is different flavors that come out of these um i really like this one now this is just my personal opinion it does make me hyper it if this is an indica baits but it hypes me up that's why i'm fixing to hit this and that's why i'm doing this this honestly y'all it has a good mellow taste it's not real skunky kind of taste it's um just bland it it's to me is what weed should be it should make you feel as soon as you hit it it should make you cough and just make this warm feeling all over your body like you can just do the best meditating you can do so we are going to move outside so we can hit this pipe and do some good testing on it i want to be able to tell you what my tastes are and everything now outside it is like 30 degrees so i will have a cotton hat on um but i'll be back in just a few minutes we'll get the weed ready we'll get the pipes ready we'll head out on the deck and we'll see what will come out of this so we'll be right back all right y'all we are back i hope this turns the audio turns out good if not we'll just do something else with it but we are pulling out our heater here it's cleaned out give it a good clean there's just a little bit down there but we ain't gonna worry about it now so we can get a good taste out of this we're just gonna do a pinch of this if i don't fling it everywhere just a nice little good pinch kind of grind it up a little bit honestly y'all i've been grinding this up with my fingers more than the grinder and i think it's been giving it a better taste all right now again this is blue dream the indica based we will try this out let's see what happens please hit that like hit that subscribe hit that bell let me know what you're smoking at this time join me in a good smoke it's really really mellow um you do have a bit like a berry kind of flavor to it it's not earthy i don't it's not like an earthy gaggy taste it's um real mellow it has a calm it don't have a real potent aftertaste i like to sit there after i smoke one and kind of have that taste in the back of your mouth like i don't know how to describe this one it's not sour to where it kind of burns that area but it's a really good one and now i will tell you with this one like i said earlier it does have a lot of calming effects so let's give this another try because i put two pitches in here and i ain't wasting this [ __ ] and then we'll go back in and talk it don't help when the wind is blowing uh y'all it's just a good taste even when you have to burp and blow smoke all right y'all we are gonna go back in and i will be right back all right now we're back inside so i can talk a little bit louder i'm trying to respect a lot of people at once um like i was saying out there if y'all did not hear me good i will say it now it has a good aftertaste the smoke is not bad i know you want me to play with your thing

daddy's on the on the video come on down no down and i feel like i can get up and get more creative because i it does something with my brain to where i'm like this morning i've already been on two different channels trying to organize some stuff i've already done a couple other projects i'm making a making a list for different things i have done multiple things all day today and it is just

of it's not so if some of this offends you just by me just skip this particular episodes for those who it really affects so what do i think about blue dream i'm going to give it the third shelf um what do i mean by that is i'm gonna go buy an eighth of it when i get enough money and i will put it up on my third shelf that one is for the ones that really do good things for me my second shelf would be more for like my nights and see what else i can do but if i don't feel like it's going to do anything with my body i'm going to put it on my lower shelf my lower shelf is just going to be like it that's just my weed to smoke that's just my weed to smoke because i don't want to waste my good [ __ ] when i'm having a seizure or i'm having a very bad day i can't concentrate well i will

strain blue dream so blue dream is a sativa dominant hybrid originating from California it's achieved a legendary status among west coast range crossing a blueberry indica with a sativa haze blue dream balances full body relaxation with kind of a gentle and cerebral invigoration odd novice and veteran consumers alike enjoy the level effects of blue dream which is you gently into a calm euphoria some blue dream phenotypes express a more indica like look and feel but the sativa leaning variety remains the most prevalent with kind of a sweet berry aroma a regiment of its blueberry parent Blue Dream delivers swift symptom relief without heavy sedative effects this makes blue dream a popular daytime medicine for patients treating pain depression nausea and other ailments requiring a high THC strain the flavors associated with blue dream are going to be blueberry sweetness and berry and the feeling or attributes that I would associate with this strain would be happy relaxed uplifted euphoric and creative blue dream is like the Bayer Aspirin of bud and it should be in every medicine cabinet smoking is slightly blueberry and harsher than expected vaporize it's very smooth and it has a perk up and kind of a get er done benefit you may want to clean in a house nice well-rounded daytime medication not at all sedating I think you'll enjoy it", "ahjI-3RIaKs": "[Music] all right this week on Canadians cannabis reviews we have Aurora Blue Dream it's a sativa hybrid from the original blueberry strain created by DJ short in the 1970s or 80s and haze which has been around since the 1960s should be a good strain we look forward to trying it up everybody welcome back to another Canadian cannabis review with Dave and Gavin what's up Dave not too much buddy how about yourself well too much you're trying to have blue dream this week of course and uh yeah it looks like a very very nice strain where I picked it up on Friday at the NSL see and hopefully it uh live up to the hype that's also blue dream back there from the Instagram was using for pictures so that's gonna be excellent and so was blueberry and hey she said yeah blueberry which is a sativa created by DJ short it has a book out which is cultivating exceptional cannabis but it's at a print right now he's known as the Willy Wonka of pop producing early is quite famous buddy it's completely offline so nobody's never seen this guy and you know nobody knows what he's alive or dead or still exists or it doesn't work like a fictional character he could be yeah yeah but you never know I'm very excited to try it anyway it should be good how's your weekend been good very very good um watched you see didn't want to cooking standard things for me absolutely got me to UFC last night was very entertaining a lot of decisions but main event I think there was a not good when Jaime you're a bunch didn't it yeah yeah and in the stomach which seemed done huh no that's what kickin yeah yeah but like no one wants kicked for the heel in the ribs not gonna be a good time no yeah he got the effects yeah very quickly and then this smells delicious as well we smell some of the blueberry sweetness I know for sure it's supposed to be kind of a sweet berry and kind of a piney taste so it's C pining yeah that's what to call him I was gonna say earthy but piney works and then but I think for the rest of the character right it was mainly decision drew yeah yeah absolutely from the prelims all the way through and then I think fortunately it's finally spring like actually got out yesterday sat in the Sun like oh man it was nice and I walked around downtown a bit EF tilled markets I did get to the market yesterday morning it was fantastic it's very busy just you know walk around check things out it's been a while since I've actually been to the market so which one the one up here 21 okay yeah the Keith brewery one that people forget to open is really like the go-to it used to be all the like most of the major vendors from that one moved down to Pier 21 lace when they started that yep they've gone back the clock turn it's dolls now because they've all read on it with the Connors that are attached yet nice that's good I was like the Berk lion I mean it's kind of a like an event an adventure going through the brewery America to nuts all redone oh so that's not all right yeah it doesn't feel like I saw there will be no more nice there's actual signs and not just like handwritten notes telling you to go down this dark but down at the end of their college guys serving pancakes they're great creepiest market ever yeah well I mean it's the oldest one of the others breweries in North America yeah but if I'm a local and I'm feeling unsafe like wondering where I'm going I'm glad they redid it and put in lights and real sign that's fair yes didn't do too much else a lot of roasting and kind of chickens yeah I mean chicken stall gonna make chicken soup today what else you been doing not too much actually you just takin it easy you know what yeah we went disco show on Friday that was fun which are super nice people yeah absolutely there their office is located up on Clyde Street and Halifax across from the Clyde Street I used to be the cloud street liquor store I guess just a dedicated cannabis store now light street weed yeah so uh yeah very nice people very knowledgeable lots of lots of stuff to check out there so if you're in I think that's a Mary Jane's Affiliate store I believe so as well yeah but they sell pipes and papers and nice little selection or everything you could need super knowledgeable staff probably there mainly to educate on their products but I think they could educate on all abilities yeah very knowledgeable I would say and then got some t-shirts there so they do sell limited merchandise but the shirts are incredible quality and it's again super nice people so if you're out there those pop in and say hi doesn't ask them any question you have they'll explain anything that you don't know about the weed which right now turns out to be a lot but we're still learning about including what terpenes are and how they affect things and there's you a lot more to this and I would've ever expected yeah it's not just roll a joint and smoke it and just get high I mean there's you know of course with the different strains and whatnot that are out there now you're gonna get different effects terpenes are gonna affect you differently so this is stuff we're gonna start researching as well alright maybe just remembering a lighter maybe one down here yeah that's a great idea nice great flavor yeah yeah absolutely a little harsh with a no expected well maybe it's just a little driver friend slc well alright but yeah is look tastes a little stronger that's not bad he's got that little throat catch yeah it's not as smooth as some of the other no no for sure but you know I'll let you know anyway it's not bad it's a it doesn't taste bad it's just it's got a stronger kind of smoke hmm and the effects are starting to come on very quickly yeah I do need to remember to sativa do you say it was a hybrid or yeah but no it's locked says say it's a team of you said I read it is a hybrid well according to what I read anyway yeah I mean from blueberry and haze like both both very popular brands and restrains and both been around for decades yeah kind of staples and then DJ short got together and me this yeah yeah he's done some other strains to he's done was a vanilla luna cocoa cush as their haze blue Velvets so you know he's done quite a few other kind of I guess craft weed yeah I guess yet the strains themselves are probably endless because there's so many oh yeah starting points yeah oh very head effects already oh yeah yeah I'm definitely feeling it it's a nice smoke the other thing to consider to it is the day after daylight savings so or an hour shorter on sleep it's not my problem yeah that's exactly what's going on so even though you're losing an hour of sleep well there's no plus side to daylight savings by I I I'm not an advocate at all the shops and the merchants they get to keep their lights on the main street so people yeah you lost an hour of sleep this weekend thanks to Kaiser Wilhelm people think it's for the farmers but it's really not theirs yeah if you have a look for daylight savings from last week tonight it's a good story on YouTube what do they say about this if the farmers don't care yeah cows don't care what time it is not because they're stupid make sense it was an energy-saving measure by the Germans back in 1918 or yeah around the first world war and for some reason people adopted it and it's just carried on since for no reason cuz I thought I had to do with consumerism and lighting up the main streets no no no no because I mean the lights come on regardless it doesn't matter what time you know the Sun goes yeah you move the Sun forward so as you're moving into Christmas it's all dark gonna light off and it looks like Pleasant for people no so all energy savings and [ __ ] us all huh not even energy savings actually there's a 1% increase in energy consumption well but statistics show that what you lose and sleep you make up for in mortal danger because there are actually more accidents than Monday after daylight savings as well so because they're tired and strung out exactly nice it's terrible it is all limb back the Kaiser Wilhelm exactly first world war yep we should have beat who we did what the [ __ ] I know we couldn't repeal daylight savings time no it doesn't make any sense to me I don't know if anybody else can explain a good reason for daylight savings but there you go Jesus that is hitting me like well yeah that's a very strong sativa yeah it is a very strong sativa what is that 22 percent or so yeah twenty one point four but is it it is a heavy hitting twenty one point for or um it's gone right to my head yeah you punish that one off alright we'll see how we're doing in twenty minutes half hour make sure that we're still high oh yeah well we still be hot if we make it back we'll let you know welcome back and so what do you say Dave if I'm still pretty good stone definitely strong yeah I used to me that sounds great absolutely very heady high enjoyable great daytime weed very sativa no I believe cords more what the bottle says and less what the site said more sativa less hybrid yeah good weed it wasn't quite as harsh I'd say Nate in half does that still have any coffee and so it wasn't the best first day what's a nice hot yeah absolutely it's a not for not really for beginners I wouldn't say more experienced smokers will probably enjoy this a lot all right oma slots thank you very much for watching if you enjoy what we're doing like and subscribe if you have any comments feel free to leave them", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check

now let's get stuck into the Blue Dream another toy to show you while we're at it when you've lucky grinder beast so got about a gram and a half or so it is left so we could easily just read the whole thing later this thing tends to devour two bullets boy it doesn't shred them so fine kappa not perfect and fine this is my new fave rider because not only is it virtually impossible to fail for Posse you could probably pull it like no joke ten grams or so maybe into this beast what she ruins ever so smooth I checked that out did that look nice finally crumbled rotted and pulverized exactly the way I wanted okay let's get the smoke Cheers who when we start today so this week I head strainers choice is no longer than the blue drink and this is some really really connoisseur fruit heads - it's combination of blueberry cross with haze so it's not a pure uplifting cerebral high although that's the first thing you experience but it's enough to raise your and eventually I'm tambour in there or so this long last and high gradually evolves into a more sort of relaxed body sensation so it's got like a real sort of second down to it it's a combined heart not just your typical soaring haze hi I love it a nice for yeutter gourmet stock she showed you earlier well I'm gonna be saving that for a special celebration session when I hit my new objective of 2,000 subscribers so guys if you haven't already hit that subscribe button please do so and then we crack in with some more amazing cannabis okay guys I hope you've enjoyed it this week I certainly have I'm really feeling pause for today eternity recommend the blue ring until next week this is top shelf girl smoking on I saw him out bye-bye", "Nt5FG5EGN1A": "welcome to the secret history living inside my wife and I his secret aquarium wait I said secret twice didn't I honey she says yes all right why are we looking at this dark cube well I put some food in I put algae tablets in or spirulina and everybody is up front so let's hit the lights and see what happens hold on boom look at all that look at them all so we've got the pleco leopard frogs we've got look at all these shrimp there are just piles of the shrimp and they're all fighting now these are check this out this everybody is saying that caridina and neo caridina do not interbreed any species yet again look at this tank look how blue some of these mala wash rim are these Malakar Edina power parapet entus I think is how you say it also lots of pregnant shrimp lots a healthy shrimp everybody's doing well we've got like the reddish rusty color line with some pink use to it and then we have also the darker blue lines and then kind of a gray smokey line and then we've got the coy handlers also we've got shrimp swimming around all over because a shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp and the near knee right snail all this stuff pretty much most of it in you have especially the plecos is from aquatic arts calm and if you guys want to head over there look at the saddle on this gal you can really see her saddle if you want to go over there you can get 15% off your first order on any of these wonderful fish I've got the L 333 and the leopard frog plecos these guys the ones I got from them a year and a half on a have gotten much bigger there probably yeah big now and they're bright banana yellow and black I'm hoping these ones can join their brethren these neo caridina blue shrimp do great with these gold nebula caridina shrimp don't be scared just because it says caridina this tank we have let grow out the co2 has not been running on it at all this was predominantly pink tank and actually now we're starting to see some more pink highlights again coming back I was gone for a while we trimmed it pretty heavily but firts have not been a priority so without the fertilizers you can see the the toll it can take there's probably a lack of phosphorous or something like that that's that would impact the metabolism phosphates I should say metabolism of the plant and can cause those holes usually they're yellowy and then they rot through but I'm sure the shrimp have been eating what's what's what they're now I was saying somebody asked me Alex when do you like to trim your plants I like to trim them when they've gotten too large that's the best time to trim them no the the best time to trim there's another celestial pearl danios coming out to make an appearance that is a female because you see the little black dot on her by her anal fin and then all the tin Winnie Daniels looking good they're mostly female you can tell that because they got the belly that's all big and they're just a little bit bigger than the males who have kind of this purple shimmer to them purple and mahogany depending on the the selection of where you get them probably different collection points but this is about as big as you'll ever see a celestial pearl Danielle get probably not even an inch and then so I was saying though the best time to cut a plant I like at night because you can see here this is all closed up and so you can really see the nodules and there's even more color in the nodules and then you can cut it and it's less of a mess you're gonna cut less of just the end of things accidentally same with the rotala Licio Ludwig yeah excellent Custer as' and then we've also got that rotala red butterfly mini red butterfly Vietnam pink all sorts of stuff in here it looks like my log and Aundre me Bowl die silver is taking a beating though we should probably give it some more light so let's ZZZ right let's scoot over some lights so we can get this in here and get these these leaves some light cuz it's choking it out and even the lily pads so we got a deficiency of some nutrients here's what I think would I suspect I think we've got a phosphate and if I had to guess it looks like phosphates and perhaps we need some more potassium that vitamin k as they say let's see uh yep I am out of K so that makes sense that's probably what it's lacking the foss phosphates come on take care of the metabolism of the plants and the potassium can help regulate how chlorophyll processes things as well as signals from the plant on what it's supposed to be doing through it's I guess you could call it a nerve system but through its through its little crazy system look at this baby nebula Gold nebulas I think the only people selling them other than people who bought them from there and they're reselling babies is aquatic arts calm and then we've got some panda loaches making appearance but yeah everything's looking good in here the login' under me bull died silver that was from Han aquatics also have a link to that in the description as well as merchandise so I was just hopping in with a little surprise video so say hello to my little friends that was awful what that French was that Austrian was that just it's like just bad I'm sorry I apologize sorry France sorry Al Pacino Hawkeye so I'm also curious to see how these these guppy / endler hybrids how they do when they cross with just a golden endler female so you can track the babies really easy the orange shows up really strong but the ones that are from a different mother they don't have those same traits so sometimes you can mix several strains at different different live barriers and if if the females and males have markings so see the females here don't but these two were males and the female while she's hanging out back up there well here she comes there is the female so she has enough color on her which I love when they do that and that big old gravid spot on her near her anal fin that big dark area and then the bulging belly that that tells you she's a girl but it's just great that they're breeding color into the female line now and not just the males can actually see some blue iridescent coming off of this one too which is a this one this female here is not the yellow one it is the Hawaiian blue from Bentley Pascal but also Luke wrote war but originally created that line with the Hawaiian blue and then I think the blue Moscow mixed together look at all these shrimp man I should call Joe's Crab Shack or Popeyes or who's who eats a lot of cheap shrimp no I'm just kidding so I'll have to be going through here and I have not cold or done anything with the shrimp you can see there's still more pregnant females the blue ones are kind of being out competed I believe also the Phoenix razz Boras doing awesome they color up when you surprise them with the light or food and right now they're really relaxed and chill but if you shake things up a bit a lot of times they'll school back up together yeah see they start to come together or if there's a bigger fish in there and then they actually change color on the spot so that's why I've said I like them a lot more than chili razz bor\u00e5s in general and Aquatic Arts yet again seems to usually have them so that's all just wanted to show you guys a little update on this also look there was no duck weed in here two and a half weeks ago I mean none that you could find it must have been in the filter or you know it's just everywhere this stuff's evil so I need to get something to agitate the surface so it won't grow a little bit more and then I'll probably over flood the tank on to some sort of Tupperware lid or something and try to scoop off the duckweed in mass en masse alright guys you and O moss one more time check out the links below if you feel so inclined if you're sitting back reclined and you want to get in line with my clothing line that is quite refined that is on the links below you can get clockwork bettas goldfish shrimp and also botanical illustration or I guess I should say biological illustration anatomical of different fish I do take requests and I do do I do do just like everyone everybody poops and so I take requests and I have done several custom portraiture style paintings I usually use the fish tank water and the Sumi ink in my process of making it and I just yeah so I just wanted to show you guys this tank just a little midnight surprise midnight snack it shows you how much the shrimp really do not need vision you can keep them in the dark I mean there's hundreds of shrimp in this seventeen gallon tank so these are mala which are caridina gold nebula these are bagel I think these are addy ops this but they are a filter feeding algae they're called a long nosed shrimp is their class or subgroup but they're actually a their nickname is the short nose Japanese algae eating shrimp but they're doing well I don't think they've been breeding in the tank but they've been nice and healthy for months and months and I've got a grip of them in there christmas moss is doing great and then also you know we've got the burgundy tiger lily and my favorite the Kabam buffer cotta that closes up at night so that's how you know this is legit I didn't fake it it was nighttime but yeah I hope I can get some breeding going on in here soon and just get a little more I'm going to trim out and get some more open space here but we got a new tank that is in the works on the way you're here at a loading dock and I need to pick it up all right that's enough talking I said I was gonna keep it short I lied I'm a dirty liar if you like my lies and my fish and my shrimp my little shrimpy shrimp please hit that like button that lies button when I say I'm doing something short and I'll try to get something actually educational oh we have a sneaker mail we're gonna have to catch him I see color coming out on his side can't have that in there that's an end Larry and he snuck through somehow probably on a piece of moss or something as a little as a little fish a baby fish a oh he what a punk there he is right there look at that so can't have him in there he's gonna screw everything up he may have already done it I mean more than likely he's already introduced himself genetically to the females in the tank also all the sink lists didn't know he was in here so don't know where he came from maybe he was in another tank too and hopped on over the Panda load is still chillin and Lukas Brett's the bluest blue dream shrimp in the world all right guys I just needed to show you this shrimp pile and all the critters and that everyone's doing well kind of an update on the aquatic arts unboxing check them out we're gonna do a big giveaway again in the winter so everybody who participates a portion it's like 8% or something like that of the money spent gets put into a pile set aside for everyone on the channel who's subscribing and/or ordering and when you order you then are entered into winning giveaways we've given away over several thousand dollars worth of stuff now and so Thank You aquatic arts for helping us out and helping me create this shrimp pile and hopefully soon we'll see the plecos getting some color in them that l3 3 L 3 3 3 3 3 3 there's three threes three cubed really cool cool fish and at a great price through them they are a little small but still so worth the price I think it's like the other day it was on sale was like $50 or $48 in town they want 129 so just bonkers check them out they buy from local breeders all throughout the Midwest all right I am so done talking I am I'm so sorry for talking so much that's what I say to my wife all the time and I think she's gonna leave me for talking but my goal is if I never stop then she won't have time and so I think that's probably working is it is it not honey see perfect yeah alright so I will talk to you guys later take care of your fish your shrimp your tanks your lights yourself and your dr. pepper hold it dear tell it you love it the right time is now and I'll talk to you guys later Joe did you ever do", "Fe3b9S-SibI": "hey guys this afternoon testing out the arrow pro blue dream cartridge came in at 90 percent THC and been hitting this out for a little while I'm gonna say good flavor it's not as flavorful as some of the other arrow Pro cards that I've had but it is very strong the 90 percent each key obviously shows here but TV percentage isn't everything as I would say that I think some of the mountain mists that I've gotten have been a little bit stronger than this one still overall a great quality cartridge and can't complain I mean it's way better than most cards out there but it's not the strongest of the strongest arrow pro but it's still really really good and here is a take a hit of it so AeroPro if you're not familiar with it they use their own type of battery and that battery has a different type of connection so it's an automatic lead magnetic connection there is no threading it fits nice the battery when you hit it AeroPro batteries vibrate while you hit them and how you tell when the battery is dying is as it's degrading dying you'll start vibrating like when it's done hitting then you'll feel another vibration that means the battery's starting to go out there's different ranges different vibrations it does for how much percentages laughs there's three of them and we'll post that in our arrow pro review that information but overall two thumbs up cartridge tastes pretty good and effects are pretty awesome it's a great strength not the absolute strongest arrow Pro cartridge this blue dream but a great card nonetheless and definitely one of the better cartridges out there thanks for watching guys as Dow connection and have a great week [Music]", "xsTfi029PUc": "[Music] women dream blue dream blue dream is absolutely everywhere it's a huge strain it's rare to walk into a dispensary and not see blue dream I mean I see it all over the place it seems one of the most popular strains out there virtually everybody likes that's a great strange period smoke hi everything blue dream is one of the most commercially successful strains in California it is like the McDonald's of marijuana back in 2004 when I was growing it with my business partners it was very new it looked different and so it's sold very very well my name is Beth and I'm one of the original growers of Blue Dream I made it popular I had just graduated college early and moved to San Francisco to work for a law firm and was hanging around with a couple like DJs who were very much into the nightlife scene one of my deejay friends like hey like I know of this after-party and it happened to be house and we met it was like fireworks like immediately became in love like it was just an instant connection that we had with one another and ever since been we kind of became inseparable and he told me that he was a freelancer he had like three or four little plans alight and I was like very cute and humble and I told him during that kind of like look don't fall in love with me because I'm moving to New York and I'm going to law school and he very concisely drafted a million dollar cash business plan that he presented to me in an excel sheet that said and this is how you're gonna make your first million dollars in cash honestly at 21 the idea of being hundreds of thousand dollars in debt and moving to New York versus traveling the world and doing it cash and tax free sounded pretty awesome it was really important that we were creating something that was visually beautiful and that it was packaged in a way that made it sexier and for me it was creating a brand story because the market was so flooded with so many other strains that were being grown outdoors I was what's cool about blue dream is that like the buds are so blue and crystally and they smell awesome because that was the only strand we were growing and we were flipping it every eight weeks we were able to tip the market because it was like what is this new strand where is it coming from and how that were able to get so much of it all the time I met the buyer that bought for 17 different locations in Southern California loved it he was like we're not getting this kind of stuff in Los Angeles this is going to fly off the racks in LA and because they were flooding the LA market with it we couldn't keep up with it which has been when we got our second house between 2006 and 2008 it was the most popular it was the hottest people wanted it everywhere I quickly realized that they were taking our products marking it up and then driving it down there and getting almost twice what we were getting here in San Francisco for it so when I realized that there was a large margin that I was missing out on I started doing it I was only like 22 and drove the horrible speed limit of like 55 miles an hour down the 101 to 5 yeah it was a little bit scary you know to be doing what we were doing and I didn't want to get in trouble I didn't want to get busted I didn't want to spend days in jail because I was growing plants don't get caught yeah I would think about my family a lot you know I'd be like don't get caught guys don't get caught I visualize what my life would look like when I was done and out of this job out of his career like what are my next steps and knowing that like this was not going to be it for me it's just something that I didn't want to do as a lifelong career and eventually I made my goal and I got out I learned so much from my experience and growing blue dream I learned about relationships about trust you know I always tell people yeah I mean money grow on trees before I made flower arrangements for brides and grooms I learned to use the things that I had and the tools and the gifts that I had to be much more successful [Music] [Music]", "WWqNWrNA284": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "qphCF98HXZY": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing blue dream by our friends over at true infusion you guys there it is there it is i'm so excited for this review today i don't know how we've never reviewed blue dream before this is like one of the most researched strains of all time according to leafly you guys if you don't know about blue dream i'm about to drop a little knowledge on you because this is a strain that's been around for a long long time and i am very familiar with this strain as i have tried it a ton of times so blue dream is a sativa dominant hybrid strain that is a cross between the indica dominant blueberry and the sativa dominant haze so two massive strains coming together to create blue dream which again is one of the most popular strains of all time so before we get into this review let's go ahead i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna take a look at it together all right you guys so what did you guys think of this stuff definitely let me know what you think in the comments below personally i'll tell you guys i think this looks like quintessential blue dream i have seen blue dream more times than i can count you guys and honestly when i saw this i knew right away this was blue dream this is not like when i picked up the white fire og kush from true infusion and said there is no way this is white fire og kush and then determined that it's either a sherbert gelato that they had mis represented the strain in their jar which honestly you guys i really do like that um true infusion is transparent about their testing they put all of these qr codes right here um on their packaging here which takes you to their testing for these strains so like for example this blue dream was testing out at 21.3 percent total uh active cannabinoids and then it was 24.5 total cannabinoids so you know 24 and a half percent total cannabinoids is not bad and then this actually was also tested for the terpene profile which tested out at 2.85 terps which was mostly consistent of that pining flavor or like the pine or the lemonade uh you know which is basically just lemon flavor so that was what the majority of the terp profiles consisted of with this stuff you guys um but i'll tell you what i'm still a little bit bummed out that there is still no answer from true infusion on what happened with that white fire og kush you guys i think true infusion you guys owe your customers an explanation for why they paid for white fire og kush like myself and we did not get white fire og kush that is classic bait and switch not cool at all 100 percent misrepresentation of what was in their jar and i'm not cool with that so sees you know that's what he goes by on instagram where are you at man why are you hiding why are you hiding when everybody is calling you out for the exact same thing people know what wi-fi or og kush is they were out there and experienced and you are the head grower at true infusion and you're nowhere to be found dude so honestly man i'll tell you what until you guys answer for this mis labeling i purchased three strains only two of which i'm going to be reviewing this blue dream and then there is one other one of which i just like from true infusion but i'll tell you guys that i will no longer be reviewing true infusion strains if they don't come up with some answers for us because we demand answers and transparency from the companies that we are supporting and doing business with you guys at true infusion it's a privilege that you guys are in the marijuana industry and that you guys get to sell medical cannabis so you know what if you want people to stop patronizing you we'll do that and we'll take our business elsewhere to the hundreds of other growers if you guys don't want to speak up for the people who are demanding answers like myself for what the hell happened because truthfully i feel like i deserve a full refund for the three-eighths that i purchased of that wi-fi kush i never should have bought that many it wasn't really my fault if you guys want to know what happened that day go look up my orange sherbet review from seoul dispensary that was more of a dispensary issue than it was with true infusion but you guys true infusion i'm not happy with you guys i'm just telling you guys that and sees i think it's [ __ ] that you're missing an action when people demand answers for why they are being mis-sold products that are being misrepresented so anyways rant over you guys now it's time for happy awesome fun times doing these reviews you guys so let's go ahead and just dive right into this review here today you guys so i'm gonna crack the top here and as always this is such a shame you guys where the hell are the terps why does weed not smell like weed true infusion get it together you guys i've called you out more times for your lack of terps like i said i'm just done buying 50 ace that don't smell it's not right and i don't i'm not gonna stand for it anymore so you know what if this is the way that your strains are going that they just don't smell i'm done supporting you guys true infusion you guys have been a long time fan of uh excuse me like a fan of i've been a fan of your strains but i'm getting sick of the popcorn buds i'm getting sick of the lack of terpenes in your bud that you guys are selling for 50 bucks that's premium bud don't package it to look all nice and then give me stuff that doesn't smell like wheat what is up with that you guys now to their credit when i broke this stuff up and i ground it up it was the typical really sweet and kind of fruity flavors that blue dream is known for you guys there's nothing i could really put my finger on other than just saying it was kind of like just that classic fruity flavor um you know that i've come to expect from blue dream so like you know the blueberry that flavor the fruitiness that was really in the forefront you guys that's what i experienced you know so i'm sure the pine with the haze is there but it's like it's definitely covered up by the sweetness of the berry that's in this um you know strain so um you know that's it for that but let's go ahead let's get the light on and look at this stuff you guys now this isn't the frostiest looking stuff by any means by any means but it's this light light light lime green coloration you guys let me pull out one of the buds there you guys see how light that is and look at those orange hairs you guys get the hell out of the way here maybe it'll focus maybe probably not but regardless those orange hairs you guys see that stuff is like it's so light these are almost like peach you guys this is exactly what blue dream is supposed to look like if you get something that says it's blue dream and it looks anything other than something like this you don't have blue dream it's how we determined that your wi-fi wasn't wi-fi true infusion because i've had it so many times i know people who cultivate that strain so don't try to pull the wool over a consumer's eyes who are educated and know better than the people growing this sad now i'll tell you when i press on this stuff like i said with the grinder that classic blue dream flavor comes out and god is it nice man so nice but this stuff is really pretty brittle you guys um i mean i guess it's it's not super brittle but it's not really ultra malleable either you guys so that you know that a little bit of a bummer there um harvest date on this you guys is 8 27 so august the 27th you guys today i am filming this on the 18th of september so this isn't even a month old you guys i mean this stuff should be way fresher than it is um and i mean i guess it's still a little malleable but it should be even i mean this should still have moisture in it if it's not even a month old i'm not sure this stuff is fully cured yet honestly you guys but it is what it is we got it when we got it we're doing the review when we get it i mean i know you guys aren't going to see this review until the 10th of november which is when this review is going to come out and you know a couple months back from reviews you guys i'm so backed up here but regardless i'm excited to try this out you guys let's see what this blue dream is all about so today i am going to be enjoying this blue dream out of my air riser extreme q desktop vaporizer i got this bad boy set to 375 as you guys see right there then god i gotta keep excuse me you guys are gross of sniffles in here you guys that blue dream is getting me sniffly so this side you guys that's the side with the screen on it just clean that piece out that is gonna go into the vape itself i've got one more male end there that one doesn't have a screen that one is going to go into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler if you want to know what a triple filter bubbler looks like you're looking at it right there where my finger is you guys that's a chamber that would have ash that would catch uh eggs that would have carbon in it that would catch ash that would typically get in the water so it would prevent the ash from reaching the water which is the second filtration chamber so i've got some brand new purified water in there and in the third chamber as always just an organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities that were left in this bud and not cured out in the final stages of growing but you guys if you guys are ready i'm ready i haven't had blue dream in a hot minute honestly probably been over a year since i've had blue dreams so i want to see how this stuff stacks up to some real deal holy feel good blue dream that i've had in the past so if you're ready i'm ready let's jump into it and try out some of this blue dream by true in fusion all right you guys so first rip wow this actually shocked me i feel like i just spit it the camera shockingly that produced a lot more vapor than we're used to seeing on uh our typical review so maybe there is some extra moisture in here um it was very very smooth now flavor wise i'm just getting a very subtle subtle fruity flavor you guys it's kind of just on the tip of my tongue which it was the first rip so let's see if that flavor develops on this second rip here all right so i'll tell you guys about 75 75 to 80 of the way through that rip i started feeling it coming on through my head that is something that i really really like i'm looking for that because that is an indication of potency for me now let's go back to the flavor you guys flavor on this this is crazy but the flavor is so subtle and subdued it's almost non-existent like maybe a tiny hint of berry um but like the first rip almost was more flavorful than the second rib and you saw how big that second rip was so god i really hope this flavor doesn't die because it is gonna crush them in the taste category i don't know what's going to happen i've got to finish out this bowl to see how this finishes out on the taste category but while i'm doing that while i'm finishing vaping this bowl i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this blue dream so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the blue dream by true infusion and you guys who are familiar with blue dream tell me this stuff doesn't just look like quintessential classic blue dream i mean this stuff has got that really light fluffy butt that really nice lime green coloration and those orange hairs are just so light and orange they're literally almost peach in coloration you guys this stuff is not the most crystally or covered in trichomes as you guys can see here but they're in night a nice proportion to the actual hairs and again this really is just that quintessential blue dream i've always seen it look this way you guys so honestly true infusion did a great job keeping up with the industry standard on this one all right you guys so what did you think of this stuff under that macro lens you guys you know you heard me just talking about it the deal is this is that it's like blue dream has always looked this way you guys i mean as long as i have known this strain which is a long time not gonna tell you guys my age or anything like that because i'm an old geezer but you guys i'm telling you like blue dream has always looked like this they definitely got a true cut you know of the right seeds and this is blue dream there's no question about it at all um you know i don't think personally it's like the most unbelievable looking strain it's just kind of a generic looking strain in my opinion even though blue dream is blue dream and it's very specific to this strain like once you've seen it once you guys you've kind of seen it a thousand times but like you've seen how awesome bud can look and how like crystal covered it can look and you know blue dream is just kind of an average looking strain in my personal opinion but god there is so much going on with this stuff and i i'm like man i'm just jazzed so excited to talk to you guys about this because god i have this you know and i'm sure you guys know you know if you don't now you know but uh that was not funny at all but like seriously you guys the deal is this is that i have this love-hate relationship with with true infusion because it's like i think that they have so much potential there but they just like i think it's probably because of how big in a mass scale they're trying to grow on that they just can't dial in these strains and that's just the fact you guys i mean i haven't seen true infusion coming through with strains that are like truly dialed in and honestly that's just disappointing you know i'm telling you that you know now i mean i've just done enough of these reviews and i've bought so many of their eights where it's like it's just the novelty honestly you guys i think it's like people like collecting these you know jars and you know like saving them you know putting them in there like trophy case or whatever that like to me i don't need to try all the true infusion strains now to know that it's like it's it's at best good ganja it's not great it's good ganja but they're warranting a great price tag where i've seen it priced between forty five and fifty dollars an eighth at the majority i've very very seldomly seen it for less than forty five dollars an eighth you guys so like that's across the board that is expensive stuff you guys like it it really it's not cheap uh and that's pre-tax you guys so um regard regardless i want to get into this review i want to start talking about what my final rating is on this and how i do these reviews you guys i rate all these strains out of 10 as you guys know if you've been following the channel and it's broken down into four different categories the look smell taste and potency each of those categories can earn up to 2.5 points each in its respective category hopefully coming to a total of 10 points any buds that score greater than a 7 or above we recommend anything seven or below we give the thumbs down snickel and we don't recommend it here on canopy so i want to start by talking about the looks of this blue dream so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys one last time for you guys to check out and then we will go ahead and peel back this review and go and give you guys a final rating on this blue dream by true infusion okay so you've seen this blue dream multiple times you guys i want to start by talking about the looks or the bag appeal of this stuff so let's go ahead and just do just that um so when it comes to the looks or the bag appeal of this stuff you guys i just got done kind of giving you guys my full rant on it so i don't want to talk too much about it and waste too much time um but you know blue dream just is an average looking strain to me i think they did um they did an all right job with this i don't think there was really any major problems that i see it was trimmed right the buds were trimmed right up uh excuse me the leaves were trimmed right up to the bud there um fumbling my words there for a second and i mean it's got you know adequate uh trichomes and a very nice proportion of crystals uh excuse me of hairs in the bud but it's just it's good looking but it's not great looking but just overall you guys have seen what great looking bud looks like on the channel um so to me it's gonna get a 2.0 out of 2.5 in the looks category in the smell category you guys when i open jars and like they just don't smell at all like now some of the smell is coming out but it's because i was like pressing on those buds you guys like when i first opened this jar and even now there's just no terps no terps i have no terps to report you guys so the thing is you guys when i have no terps to report that's an automatic one point you know reduction um from the smell category but it got redeemed because when i did break this stuff up it smelled exactly like blue dream it's just very very sweet kind of berryish um from that blueberry gosh that was really what was standing out it smelled you know quintessential blue dream kind of uh again just like a fruity berry is kind of what uh what the smell is like you guys if you're not familiar with this strain i personally love the smell so it's gonna get a 1.5 i mean which is the best that it could possibly get without smelling straight out of the jar you guys which sucks i mean what a bummer this stuff is like just you know you shouldn't have to grind up bud for it to smell not at all so 1.5 which i think is honestly generous for bug that doesn't smell until you break it up so 1.5 to smell category let's get to the taste that is where this stuff was a huge letdown you guys i'm gonna be and i think no joke i'm gonna give it a one out of uh 2.5 i was coughing throughout this whole thing it was like it was smooth going back but like then after i was like coughing like i should be getting really like ripped but i wasn't and you know that to me like there was something that just didn't either get fully purged out of this um you know maybe some excess moisture maybe this stuff just really is not cured enough to be honest i don't think it has personally um just based on the harvest date uh they're just rushing this stuff to shelves right now and you know [ __ ] you guys rushing rushing product to shelf is not good i'm not impressed with that at all that just shows that they don't have enough medicine to keep you know their demand which right now i mean demand is ultra high but it's like you know they can't supply keep up with the demand with their supply and honestly rushing to stop the shells not fully curing it huge thumbs down i'm only gonna give it a one i think that's generous true infusion um potency you know you guys here's the deal this stuff it's doing something but it's just like you know like you know think uh like like weed light is what we'll call this you know it's just it doesn't it's like i have a clear head and it is a sativa a dominant hybrid for sure um it's it's kind of honestly a little it's weird because my experiences with blue dream have always been very sativa whereas this is a little more on the hybrid side um because i do have a little like kind of beanie type feeling on my head but not the like gross synthetic type beanie um you know where it's kind of like squeezing your head you know this is it's not bad and i feel like it's clean medicine for the most part um but it didn't smoke right honestly i would like i i'm not gonna like the flavor the first rip i got was the most flavorful of all it shouldn't be like that you guys the second and third should be the best and those which like started decreasing and decreasing just going to that flour flavor and i'm not saying it wasn't smooth but like then i was coughing on the exhale as i just explained and like it didn't make for a good smoke it's gonna get a one out of 2.5 i think um the uh uh and this is you guys i'm sitting here i'm sorry i'm getting a little uh flustered because i was talking about the way that this stuff smoked but we're getting into um uh the potency here now and you know i'll tell you that it's it's it works but it's just it's not it's not what blue dream is supposed to be and there's something that's just not right about this strain in my opinion and i can't put my finger on exactly what that was because i mean i think it's really that it's more leaning on the haze excuse me the blueberry side of things as opposed to the haze side of things um you know which is again uh you know just it's just not medicine that i'm liking i'm just not digging it i mean the way i'm feeling right now is like it's okay but like it's only gonna get a 1.5 in the potency category you guys for me and again i mean you know i'm just not overall super fond of this it's not really doing much for my body my body is already kind of chilled out this is more of like a mental uh type of uh you know medicine and i'm you know it's unfortunate because like i'm so i want this to be that that uh medicine that's like gets me all creative and jazzed up and like you know super clear and it's like it is clear for the most part but there is definitely a little a little haziness maybe from the blueberry believe it or not um that you know i just i'm not a fan of you guys so this stuff let's go through that you know one more time it's going to be a 2 in the looks category it's going to be a 1.5 in the smell category a one in the taste category and then a 1.5 the potency that stuff's gonna that means this stuff is only a six out of ten you guys i personally would not recommend this six out of ten is gonna get the snickel thumbs down do not waste your money on this blue dream you guys i have seen so much better blue dream and i know the strain can be done so much better and you know what this stuff truthfully if i was to put a price tag on this you can't price this stuff honestly true you guys got to cut the price by 10 bucks no joke this is 35 and eight stuff uh you know it's 30 to 35 bucks in my personal opinion i think if i paid any more than like 30 i wouldn't be super happy with this stuff but that's what i think i mean you know the fact that they're warning 45 and 50 bucks i mean that is insane you guys see that you probably can't because my phone is bad at um focusing and then now the light just took over but 50 bucks for that you guys pre-taxed damn that's steep so yeah no uh on this blue dream from true infusion you guys and again i think i'm just finally about giving up i've got one more review lined up with true infusion and after that i think i'm calling it quits for about a year or so you guys i'm going to give them a break and just you know support other growers who are doing it right doing it better than true infusion you guys i'm just been a little disappointed and i've been very let down by the lack of communication you know i know these guys are online i know they have presences online or a presence online and i don't like that true infusion is hiding um when people want answers about some of the medicines that they've been buying um and they're not getting them so with that being said you guys i know i've gone on a tangent with that and i'm gonna stop bashing true infusion so much because honestly i think that they are a great company but they've got a lot of room for improvement you guys there's no question about it you guys so with that being said blue dream 6.0 which is a non-recommendation from true infusion for us today and if you guys have tried this let me know what you guys think was your batch better was the ones that they've you know other phenotypes you know that they've cut better than this one that i got let me know what you guys think and then let me know if there's any strains out there that you guys think that i need to cop because i'm looking for the 10 out of 10 you guys you know you guys i haven't found one yet somebody guide me to the 10 i know that that's out there i know it's elusive it's just like some type of uh you know jaguar hiding in the shadows you know and i'm going to find you i know i will you sneaky elusive beast you but you guys until the next one take care of yourself and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "2EL20oK56nE": "[Music] welcome to the world according

Duff pot hey it's got that it's got a beer opener on it and [ __ ] so I don't do a lot of hybrids I'm more of an indica guy so let's check this out good Scot see the buds got a lot of red hairs all right it's got a few a few little trichomes you know it's nice it's a tight bite it it looks good let me get this [ __ ] me okay let me go so I think today I'm gonna tell you a story it's kind of a funny story it's hopefully it was it sounds that way but uh it's a story about when we went to Pink Floyd and because this is in our teenagers again back I know high school probably in great Jan tenner 11 me and my buddy like I said we were still we were selling dope back then I told you selling weed and you don't want to acid around that time so my friend this other friend of mine I'm gonna say keV and jewel this little brother hit their parent is his dad was actually the first string violin from the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and his so there's this very very English couples the drinking was really you know accepted in their culture and so we somehow we got tickets for the show down in Seattle and we live in North Vancouver so his mom said she would drive four of us me and Jules and Doug this other Jules little buddy so we drive down to the to the Pink Floyd show and drop a bunch of acid and get all stoned and had a great time and uh so we decided so you know after the show is over it was amazing so it was it was it was the Pink Floyd the adult Roger Waters so it was kind of unfortunate I'm a big I mean I you know whatever but if it still was great they they played all that you know I mean they had the lasers the whole thing and when you're on a bunch of acid let's see if I can blow off this summer when you're on a bunch of acid it uh it really does it makes the show better especially you know with all the lights and children but so anyways on our way back we're driving and we're [ __ ] the highest [ __ ] now and we're coming back and it's probably twelve twelve o'clock whatever we're coming up through this little town and I'm like mrs. gralton I got this I got pull over pull over she's like I know this nice little restaurant we can pull over there very good very good pies and Pete and I don't give a [ __ ] we screw up circle language but I don't [ __ ] so she pulls over and mind you we rely on like four tabs [ __ ] acid whatever the [ __ ] that was about kind of tough and uh so I ran up to the wall and I even started to take him yes and then Catherine runs up and he's taking a leak beside me and we're just [ __ ] man Jesus Christ it was a long time and we look up and there's people we're actually pitching at the restaurant in the window like the window is lower turn over it's and the people are looking over I was like we didn't know whether we start laughing or joy and so we finish this and then Julian and Dougie come up and they take their turn and Dougie finishes first and it turns out this place was the this place was the [ __ ] doughnut shop for the their local gob station and it just turns out these cops are coming around the corner when Julian's finishing up and so they arrested for indecent exposure and public urination and this is all going on outside well mrs. Kevin's mom and hunt still on what Kevin's mom is in in hair ordering so mrs. Brokaw sees little Julian's and an cops and she comes out like I'm guns a-blazing well I don't think you should be arresting us you know we're from Canada the cops like what point to believe in bathrooms a peek at it and kill her so [ __ ] however good we know we piss inari clues and just going off like this oh man so we finally get that sorted out and get juin out I guess she had to pay bail or something and we finally got get it was pretty quick process and so but she was so mad at us she went buy any more beer for the but not even nineteen in in in Canada it's 19 or like 16 or so later and so finally we convinced her to get us some beer right before the border and we get our beer or no it was after the border and we went to the Billboard cuz back then the Bill Maher was still open till 3 a.m. and we went there and got some beer and we drank and got stoned and then the next morning I had I had all the weed still for my partner rusty who were robbed invested either who doesn't know we didn't go this show so I had to go up into the school and so I had my pink floyd t-shirt on and i'm walking to the school to go find him and it's kind of cool cuz i had my shirt on and the show was that night in vancouver and we'd already went down and saw it and we were still awake mind you and we go up so i got to go to school and I got to go deal with [ __ ] with besties and I do and so we had and this was way back away it's still about quick I we know that and we had about 2 or 3 grams of skunk and I had to invest either weed to sell and then I had to grab the skunk off him for us and so I did and I met him somewhere and then we pull up in Kevin's little red Acadian kind of sort already Katie used to just thrash the [ __ ] it's dark it's just hilarious but you pull up in this little red Acadian right and there's Kevin he's driving and I'm in this in the center and I've got this weed with me and all these people because we're the weeb you surround the car and we're just in front of our school and there's like ten people around the car I can't get so many I'm so many around so I'm like like this and all the sudden people just split and the principal sticks his head in the window and goes what are you guys peddling and I just I get my hat and I throw it on top of the weed and Kevin goes we're not peddling it's a standard seed [ __ ] takes off yeah so no it was the Pink Floyd story it's kind of fun let's see how so we're still smoking on this yeah oh I forgot to say I keep [ __ ] forgetting I want to like put a disclaimer sort of they say I don't glorify any of these stories it's not glorification of drug use or anything we got I do glorify another medical use of marijuana and for you know psychological physical ailments I'd completely um down with that scene but as far as like the coke stories and the heroin stories that I'll tell you guys like I said if I can help somebody by telling what that's sort of more the goal it's not [ __ ] really I mean I kind of want to just have a funny thing to tell Hill I'm smoking weed and starting this channel like I said I'm again shout out coach and OJ's show us my [ __ ] in this video and I got in the subs for me so I think that's really cool of him cuz I don't really know him but I watched him a lot I pop into his thing and I had twisted roots he's not a good guy but I pop into their lives you know it's like this like I said it's a cool little community and I'm I'm glad to kind of be a part of it you know every time I go in I got a shout out and that's old yeah like I said these guys are great [ __ ] guys and I'm just gonna be starting my own little crop and garden so I'm sure I'll be picking their brain for for information so there's a hybrid this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm getting pretty stolen so far and I'm not even halfway through this joint but I mean it's about a grabbing I love to grab Johnny but still it's wrong it's really good it burns nice it's it stinks it's it's got a nice no it's a little milder it's good on the throat stew again like I say I like [ __ ] that's pretty good let's roll all right I'm coming up to about nine minutes here nuts I don't like to go too

review for Blue Dream by Aurora now I bought this on November 14th it was packaged on September 10th I'm hoping to see it a little bit fresher than that but maybe that's just going to be the norm now the stats on the Blue Dream it is a sativa THC is at 17% and CBD is 0% this strain cost $7.99 for one gram let's go ahead and open it up I haven't bought a 1 gram before so I'm interested to see how this packaged up and ok similar to a 3.5 grams just on a smaller scale a little black package like this blue dream sativa let's go ahead and open that now this is 17.1% 17.1 1700 k 17.1 i stand corrected okay let's go ahead and open it up here a very childproof container like unnecessarily so this was already open here this wasn't sealed like on the other ones so jeez let's go ahead and pour that out a lot of flavor but you know a little disappointing so far okay and there's a gram so I mean it certainly looks nice not getting a lot of smell here don't a lot of aroma whatsoever I think it was because this has been opened you know theoretically since early September so as you're seen for the ground here we've got a few small main buds seems to have a nice trim on it though not seeing a lot of little leaves or extra bits that should have been cut off get on that odor we're just not getting much at all hopefully we're gonna get some more aroma here now that we're gonna grind it yeah it's quite dry really I wouldn't have ground it that much how's that dry see if we get any more smell no definitely a little more of those pine tones but nothing too recognizable so I'm gonna load this up into an air Iser solo - I'm going to turn this at about say 375 that's the regular temperature I vape at on most vapes you know every vapes a little bit different but I usually set it at around a temperature like that and adjust from there I just clean the stem so it's completely clean so we should have a very very clear and true flavor profile on this strain now when you load something like a solo to properly the herb just stays suspended in the stem so it's not coming into contact with the heater you give a very very good flavor on this fate go ahead and load that in there just let it get to temperature it's already there but give it a few minutes to really warm up let's give this stuff a go mmm so I'll get a little citrus little pine nothing too much though I'd say pine is kind of the main flavor I'm getting definitely tastes better than it smells doesn't taste amazing but it certainly doesn't taste bad there is a nice flavor to it sometimes when you have lower quality or really dry herb you get that plant flavor that kind of chlorophyll flavor personally I really don't like that flavor for me that is just bad herb so if vapes really really nice it is very smooth can certainly start to feel those sativa effects kicking in already but what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna finish this bowl I'm going to finish the entire thing here then I'm gonna set my timer for 15 minutes I'm gonna come back in 15 minutes because I think it'll be better to report on the effects after that [Music] hmm so there you go still pretty smooth that's about what I would say is you know a good length session for me for one person I don't know 10 hits was that definitely a little bit more than normal but I really wanted to experience the effects so see you guys in 15 minutes okay so it's been 15 minutes and I think that's maybe a better way to assess the effects cuz you know it does take a bit to kick in and to really see what you're gonna get so overall that is a very very nice sativa it's not super speedy you don't get that kind of you know anxiety sort of like this it's a little more relaxing and euphoric but it wasn't couch lock II certainly did feel it in my body though so overall not you know super impressed with the date it was packed on as compared to when I'm getting it flavors good not great but overall the effects are very very good I definitely would try this strain again I would hope to get a little bit of a fresher batch though and probably something with a better seal on it you know what I mean what's the point of having the seal if it's not going to be closed so overall this is one I would try again especially for $7.99 so I hope you enjoyed that stray interview guys that's Blue Dream by Aurora keep it green keep it sneaky and we'll

are pretentious ingredients we're going to offer so much insight from the side aren't we we are [Music] feeling good yep feeling judgy yep excellent lift the clash [Music] i lifted that cloche with some vigor and with it came a lot of aroma that is one chunky fresh pod or vanilla vanilla it looks like a very girthy vanilla pod yes barry these are tahitian vanilla pods grown in the riatea island of french polynesia these vanilla pods are cultivated using plant compost made from coconut palms and coconuts producing long and fleshy beans with delicious caramel and denise flavors wow okay so that is no normal vanilla pod do you know about vanilla species not at all i didn't know there were that many one is the vanilla planifolia which is the madagascan variety it originated in mexico but the french originally cultivated it in madagascar now it's cultivated all across the world but hence why it's called madagascar vanilla vanilla tahitensis is the tahitian variety which is a hybrid evolving from the original vanilla planifolia when it was grown in tahiti thus tahitensis tastes completely different it smells incredible and it is one of the softest fleshiest pods i've poked for a while should we put something in his mouth so you can't talk yeah great idea oh very nice barry we've made you a strawberry tart it's got creme diplomat in it and we used an entire vanilla pod for the batch of cream diplomat and we macerated the strawberries in salt and sugar and another entire vanilla pod so that you got the full vanilla flavor wow no expense spared i know expensive vanilla is may i we'll see about that we'll see so there is a fair old bit of vanilla in that because we really want you to taste any differences that you can know so here's the thing i have against vanilla and that's its poor reputation because it has been stigmatized as being vanilla and boring and yet when it is celebrated like that it is sublime it does taste like there's something else mixed into it it's almost like there is a fruityness to it it tasted really of cherry to me yeah i got a lot of cherry i don't think i've ever tasted vanilla like that from what i understand the vanilla plant is an orchid that basically needs to be hand pollinated one day in a whole year and if you don't do it on that one day you don't get a harvest so it's tricky hence why it is so expensive the premium range of a supermarket two madagascar vanilla pods six pounds so essentially three pounds per pod yep how much do you think we paid per pod for the tahitian vanilla six pound a pod seems like a lot but i imagine it reaches that price because there's not enough of them in the world and the people who do want them know why they're worth that and would pay it six pound a pod i reckon there are three pods worth in that so straight away minimum is going to be nine pounds we're in a pretentious video it's a very rare item so let's triple that again that seems silly after the reaction that now seems silly 16 pounds actually works out seven pounds 30 per pound okay cool it's a fundamental ingredient in baking um so i feel like you're paying then just for the quality of it and if this is the highest equality then i don't think that makes it intentional it's just in short supply high demand and it takes a lot to get it to that stage not pretentious just very expensive started off strong boys left the clutch [Music] oh and here we go what is that it's also so barry as well yeah 100 he's probably already got it that's why should it be that color um all right so we have crystals is it a rock salt it looks like some fictional gemstone that you could ward off dragons with i was trying to put it in my mouth it's just it's salt these are persian blue salt rocks the rarest and most exclusive salt on the planet they are beautiful extracted from a salt mine in northern iran the colour comes from the formation of the crystal structure under intense pressure the crystals fracture the light creating the optical illusion of a shimmering blue jewel the salt has a silky sweetness that works beautifully when grated with a grater over salads and truffle dishes wait for it this is where it gets even more battery we thought you might carry that in your pocket or something on your key ring grab it he has gone people can't see you've got one oh shut up i was looking for one of these for wasabi the other day have it because barry's already got one no lie i would compare it to what i would associate with a good sea salt it's got a minerality to it beyond just sodium chloride but not hugely different no it's a bit of theatre to the table i think that bit i get would you like to taste a dish topped with some of this rare sauce yeah so yeah fantastic bring it yummy barry we have made you a beef cutter straight out of our very own cookbook how we cook it's a classic dish with some brioche on the side i'm having a really nice day are you yeah i'm enjoying this riff salt started by a swede who was in a teppanyaki restaurant in beijing and he was inspired by the big ginger grater and using the roxul so sort of combined that with scandi design and came up with the riffsalt brand after over a decade of doing this we still come across things to today that are new to us and that we learn and it's a talking point that's its purpose surely actually you know by approaching it like that you're not setting it up to be anything that it's not that is an amazing addition every part of it should be celebrated even at a final flourish so what better way to as a final flourish than a little grating of river salt on top i like it should we talk about price i'm going to give you a frame of reference and that is molden sea salt flakes we use those a lot for 250 grams of molden it's two pounds 20 or 8 pounds 80 a kilo how much does that weigh you have 150 grams there i wouldn't be surprised if they're two pounds of rock let's say six pounds i think this is probably 10 times at 22 pounds for those three oh mate you're in luck it's 15 pounds 95 oh 106 pounds tequila i mean that's still a lot the salt an ornament as much as it is an ingredient well in that case persian blue salt rocks pretentious or not this isn't pretentious i don't know what is the idea in the story around this one feels a bit more pretentious and i don't know how i can justify that based on the same logic with the vanilla which i thought was not but i think this might be left the clash oh let's go go nice nails yes good job i do like snails when they're covered in garlic and parsley and butter and you can't taste the snail they actually come in a presentation tin and empty shell gift set and snails are considered something of a french delicacy often referred to as escargot and frequently cooked with butter finely chopped shallots garlic parsley salt pepper the environment in which you eat a snail in is usually quite pretentious it's usually high-end restaurants is what associate snails to be in but actually as an ingredient i mean you couldn't get any more basic i like the idea of snails because of their tradition and i've had them in france a few times before over the years shall we give you an opportunity to get over the fact that their snails in a cooked dish please i think you're gonna like it what is that i love i love the presentation i must say this is beautiful you've seen what's in front of you yeah i kind of assume that you know what that is a version of i presume this is snail porridge it is he's a chef it's not the snail porridge but it is our interpretation yeah this one's got four million stars lovely a very famous dish by heston so it's the it's like the stock the snails are cooked in that they're braised for a very very long time and then it's mixed in with herbs and uh and it's cooked as a porridge with oats i can't believe that you uh feeling a bit squeamish about snails and then we serve up a delicious green snail porridge and it still isn't making you salivate [Music] unreal so good at it absolutely yummy melt in the mouth which so often they can be like bullets and a bit rubbery those have been braised for a very long time four to five hours now this absolutely is not a traditional look at how snails are used i mean they make up parts of ragus in france as well as being served with partially garlic butter etc paellas in spain all over europe so you know where are you leaning at the moment this actually has given me goosebumps a little bit sometimes when you have food that takes you by surprise they make sure you have hairs in the back your neck stand up a little bit i it genuinely excites me but they're delicious and they are not pretentious no matter what the price oh no matter what the price there is this perception that tinned or canned food is generally cheaper we disproved that when we looked at things like the duck uh the coffee duck in a tin that was french and actually well sauce was a great product in a tin eight quid 300 grams these are priced at 9.99 it's good because it's for us it's a novelty to spend 10 quid on some snails is a i think that's a bargain that feels expensive for something you can dig up in the garden i wonder what the species is and whether you could just go and pick them from the end of your garden you're not the first person who said that today oh pretentious or not not pretentious no just not celebrated enough in the uk not pretentious but you like them yes still on 100 last one baz give the clash a lift that is a lot of mustard stick with the french theme muttard is it just standard mustard it looks empty i mean that's whole grain mustard [Music] okay that's some fiery mustard it tastes like mustard it's got a musty burn oh i guess younger oh that's what i'm talking about i love whole grain mustard to the point where i would slather my ham sandwich with a good thick layer of it because i can't get it hot enough we found it it's got to have it's either the hot really high quality mustard seeds then or like mega fresh to make it that powerful or it's got something else in it some form of alcohol which also gives it acidity it is alcohol this is pomery royale mustard with cognac cognac pomery royale mustard with cognac is a heavenly combination of gourmet whole grain mustard and luxurious cognac i go through quite a lot of mustard at home i'd probably go through a jar a month do you think you would go through this jar oh no i wouldn't go through that job that's a big jar who doesn't love a wax seal on something i i dream the day one day i can get a letter from the post with a with a seal like that on top it's really nice that he remembered our wedding invitations oh that's where i saw it but i've done the right occasion sometimes it can be a little tacky [Laughter] so the brand of this particular mustard mutard de mo um are from mo a cathedral town about 60 kilometers west of paris which is a town famous for producing mustard not as famous as dijon well okay can you taste the cognac in it no no you can't can you really i couldn't identify it well want to try it yes ben we've cooked you something delicious i say that me and mike have done nothing this is pan roasted pork fillet with a mustard cream sauce super super delicious wow it looks good that sauce looks amazing this is not attacking me in the same pleasurable way um with a paddle but i'm still getting the warmth just as pleasurable eva's are we even teetering on the edge of pretentious here i feel like it's such a french thing like les gargo that just because it's not normal to us we think it must be pretentious because it's from the home of cuisine but it's not it's just traditional and yummy and delicious very very special okay barry taking everything into consideration the taste where it's from the jar the wax seal which is classy when done for wedding invites how much would you think that this jar of a 500 grams of mustard cost to give you a bit of a reference point a premium mustard brand that we bought from a supermarket in a 210 gram jar was one pound 30 for the jar so that's 62p per 100 grams so that's about double the price right to my guess so let's just say this is around six quid that was 18 quid i'll take the rest of the jar off your hands wow holy guacamole it's nearly half that it's 9.99 i had a bargain i just i was just scaling up based on the size of it so yeah two and a bit times more expensive but tasted in my opinion more than two and a bit times better i was hoping for six pounds for my list i love it barry taylor pretentious or not the mustard we're talking about but comment below if it's a great quality ingredient it's made well it doesn't attend it's not pretentious but because it's served in 500 grams with a wax top it is delicious i do want the whole jar and it is pretentious so by sticking to their roots by wax sealing with a cork he thinks hundreds of years worth of craftsmanship history in fact but barry taylor is literally saying history is pretentious i don't think it is i think it's again exquisite damn damn but we've had 100 ever satisfaction i have been so happy today well over to you guys did you like any of those ingredients did you think they were pretentious comment below let us know and let us know what ingredients we should review next in the

little difficult because many of the cannabis is actually becoming a hybrid because growers are looking at blending different traits so masby's blended is kind of this cat and bird here but we're getting this kind of blending of indica sativas and even rudalus so just the origin of hybrids just in general the goals that try to obtain the best of both worlds in one plant there's often there's a popular demand to combine the autoflower plant characteristics with another desired cannabinoid and or terpene profile this is why growers are bringing that rudalus with some of the indicas or sativas whose growers are really looking for the ease of plant maintenance with also a high quality end product so it's that kind of nice kind of mixing of that blue and that yellow to get that green that kind of merger of two to get the best of both worlds and to create something new as well so the hybrid plant morphology how does how do these plants in general look well hybrids can be very variable so you want to make sure you're doing your research is highly advised so that you know what you're getting into you want to start by getting an idea of is indica or sativa dominant in morphology it's going to be really tall or it's going to have a tendency to be shorter and squattier this will give you that general classification oftentimes the goal by breeders is to take a standard strain and to breed it in the autoflower into it but keep in mind that other morphological features need to be taken into consideration more than just it becoming photoperiod independent now popular cultivation locations again it can be very diverse because with the autoflower characteristics this is a morphology that fits in many different growing conditions both indoors and outdoors with an improved cannabinoid or terpene content this makes it very easy for selection for a wide varieties of growers however breeders need to continue in this area and make improvements because while we have the rootales kind of gene and autoflower characteristics and we've got our dominant indica sativas with cannabinoids the merger of the two they're still working on ensuring you get the best of both worlds right now these hybrids might favor one versus another so there is still lots of room for improvement some people have tried some of the early hybrids and weren't really thrilled with them but there's continual improvements for this particular type of cultivation of cannabis now it's hard to kind of pinpoint any one or a couple varieties but we can see here there's many different ones that fall into the classification of hybrids i just listed a few here because remember a lot of growers are breeding in different types indica sativas the whole goal is to get the best of both worlds all in one plant with an established cultivar established strain here to help uh create this ability for growers to produce a high quality product but still meet the demands of their particular growing conditions quite well", "mE5mHmLhM0w": "here is the Blue Dream plant all grown up just a few weeks ago it was a clone and I topped it I trimmed it I pruned it a femme did so we have lots of little crowns that might pop up here and everything's looking pretty green pretty healthy see those skinny finger leaves we did have a little heat and it might be why some of the new growth is really skinny the thickness of the leaves but hopefully all that will heal up nicely with the temperature now at 80 degrees it almost pushed 90 last week so that was my main concern but everything is going good just watered it yesterday and started the bloom just last night gave it 24 hours of darkness actually 30 hours of darkness and today is day one so we'll check back periodically and see how it's doing", "DTMAYmo_jcs": "hey guys welcome back to another Liddy video about to get stoned up in here you know so today I am going to be reviewing the rose and it's dream and it is a hybrid look at the packaging though looks so secured and so pretty has like black and red and grey letters right here pretty dope it reminds me of like the rolls-royce how it has that all right here I don't know so I now have to figure out how to open this it says half right here because it's a half gram and looks a little harder then you thought it's very secure how you doing baby proof now don't rip it try to figure it out by the way this is dog fur we have a husky yeah um the world do you do this I know baby and I can't open it sorry there it is takes a genius what is that supposed to be anyways so here you have the packaging it also has read the are red and with the packaging that's actually really cool cuz the last one you had was blue right blue green you had the blue around it too and this over is it trim oh yes dream and it is here here is a size like I said it has a little red right here we shall try it I thought where's your robe on I can't find it she has a road battery but I didn't look for him to see Wow cuz I didn't know I don't know where it was gonna be yet why I did look for a butt right there alright they're gonna cut that out cuz if anything I mean oh well what should I use oh whatever the black one I'm guessing cuz it looks cool oh by the way guys she will be trying this out today and then tomorrow she'll be reviewing this one yes so let me go ahead and just get up quick lighter because this product is really good the only thing is that the wax is a little bit thicker so it's harder for it to burn and like I was watching a video I don't think that I thought about this trick but um this video how you just can burn the sides and then it'll heat up and let me just turn it on and you later well let me first try it without the lighter to see how thick it is or not if we need a lighter Jessie thank you do you not need the lady nicely she'd that dummy the like a guy hit you good hi well it takes like good products to make me like this so I love it and yeah it wasn't pretty hard I think it's just if you keep it in storage for awhile I mean looking for you can just burn it up real quick but this is really good I think the best part is that it's thick it's thick that's why it hits you more yeah this one lasted her a good amount of time oh and it does last longer yeah because it is harder for it to burn so that's why it does last longer but overall I would give this I would recommend this if you're trying to get high I would recommend this so this is a flavor and dream product growth know that was my dream is it yet stream oh yeah you dreaming it's a hybrid hue art oh and this was 30 bucks so it's not that bad it's a half damn in a pretty good half so yeah 30 bucks look at look at this eye strip of it for a half gram alright guys so stay tuned because you won't have this yes tomorrow", "s1gR76vwAFw": "what's up you guys and welcome to my channel it is your girl meet you 69 back at it again grinding with a youtube video and disclaimer

you want to find out about the pod go to my instagram and another disclaimer no this video right here is not sponsored but i am in the true leave influencer program i am part of the true squad so i do receive a slight discount however that does not affect any now that we got that [ __ ] out of the way let's talk about this problem yeah okay and for the people who keep asking me uh about the influencer program and how to get in it my answer to you is i do not know i don't know post tag tag tag and hopefully they will come in contact with you because that's only like there's no trick to it there's no science i'm not deterring anyone from trying to do it i'm just i don't know i don't know but thank you truly for taking me that's all i can tell you so i've had a couple like salty comments about it like if you i'm sorry if it offends you but i'm not gonna lie about it so if you're offended uh by the fact that i'm in the influencer program when i'm just trying to do cannabis reviews uh what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you got a problem you know my grandfather lived to be 103. and you want to know why because he mind his own [ __ ] business anyhow i just wanted to clear the air and then maybe some confusion so there will be sponsored videos and there will be non-sponsored videos but regardless of the video i still have to tell you i am in the influencer program this is just that okay sorry about that little rant little rant sorry i'm sorry it was worth it for this um you ready you ain't ready for this are you no no they're not ready they're just sitting here yes [ __ ] they're ready hurry up whatever okay [Music] what yo this looks like a big old hunker it looks like an eight bullet coke not that i know what that looks like but i've seen them on tv oh i can smell the terpenes i can tell you it smells delicious oh [ __ ] okay some crumbles either they smell a little bit or they're stanky this one's stinky sticky like we have the tea bucket set at fee 589 as always head down to new vape use code michi 69 and go save yourself some cash because why not i mean come on really okay let's get this all out ready i have no room okay there's that we've got the dab rig dude you're in the middle of making a youtube video oh yeah okay sorry so we got our dab tool out oh see that's too big oh i'm gonna hurt okay it's okay all right guys let's run this now i really enjoyed the blue dream really enjoyed the true uh the blue dream uh true pod so let's make it a banger three for three cheers [ __ ] yeah blue dream you're making my taste buds dreams come true oh god that is what's up i don't know i listen i love this strain yes yes i'd like to see it in this lit truly maybe some wax or shadow did anyone see this i saw i didn't even know they had it in crumble i just happened to see it i was like oh sometimes you walk in there and you just ask and you find hidden gems like when i don't see anything on the menu i'll walk in there like what kind of indicas do you have concentrates what kind of hybrid like go on down the line because sometimes people return [ __ ] during the day like oh wait that wasn't it or they put something in their cart accidentally so you may be able to get what you can't or you think you can't so keep that in mind would i get this blue dream again i don't think that is a [ __ ] question that needs to be answered but we will go ahead and say it yes yeah [ __ ] fire if you don't think it's fire you did not smoke it if so fight me in the comments i i honestly could cause this is a very well balanced hybrid i might it seems to me to be a little indica dominant because i can feel it in my eyes but again it's a concentrate and when i did the flower i don't know maybe so whatever i'm not checking leafly no more it is evenly balanced i was able to use it all day and still kind of have that chill relaxed indica but not too too much so i this strange right up my alley i love hypers that do that i love into cleaning hybrids so yeah [ __ ] a banger good job true leaf love it i wait a minute also we almost forgot while we're here to do a two for you guys i have a little bit of the bubble gum left i just thought about that i was like oh [ __ ] i got a little bit of this bubble gum left and that [ __ ] was fire so let's run this a little dab of that god dang it i dropped it that ain't it i think i found it i don't know i think that's a peanut oh that was a peanut i think i found some of it oh [ __ ] me running god dang it all right never mind we're gonna take a different hit okay try this again [Music] like peppery and lemony super good another well-balanced hybrid that's i was like [ __ ] i forgot i better bust this out before it's gone the equally impressed i know i will say if i had to choose i would definitely go with the blue dream over that not saying the bubble gum is not good that blue dream is just straight up [ __ ] fueg oh hey i think we're done here are we done here i think we're done here if you made it all the way to the end of this video you're awesome just go ahead and drop a like big face and if you're not subscribed assistant to my channel hit that bell ding dong when i post i mean who doesn't love [ __ ] content who doesn't love [ __ ] content not you", "eeg8au4I4vI": "hey guys welcome back this is Belle BC here doing another video episode of growing for freedom and as you guys can probably see here in this video we are hanging out in the epic 4000 watt the record breaker or at least we hope it will break the all-time record that we set with blue dream a long time ago the last time that we grew blue dream but as you can tell guys in this video we are doing things a little bit differently with the dubbed audio actually still don't have my Panasonic camera with me I've left it over at the other spot because we are getting ready to make some videos from HQ but I am waiting for all the work to be done there first and we're still wrapping things up although a lot has been done and I'm really excited about what we're gonna be doing here with the new moneymaker 4k nursery but that is the subject point of the video let's talk about what's been going on here in the gardens so you see that we're running around basically just getting multiple Vantage's of the enormous buzz that we've been growing here the the blue huge strain has definitely not disappointed this time around the buds at all areas guys are just absolutely huge and I'm gonna try to get as close as I can in here with my 24 millimeter prime lens and I do apologize again for the the lens there's no image stabilization it's a geared lens I'm like trying to like frantically mechanically operate this thing but the shots actually got a pretty decent I'm actually trying to get a little more used to shooting with primes for up-and-coming projects so although I don't plan on doing on the handheld quite like this it still helps you know to become a little more adept at using them but yeah guys the Blue Dream is just doing great I'm pretty sure that at this point we are definitely going to you know exceed seven I think we should definitely be able to at least match the best that we had ever done before with this it I'd be somewhat surprised if we didn't quality factors though I think that this one could shape up to be one of the great only because the fact that just done such a great job of maintaining the the canopy quality you know the buds everywhere around are just getting access to such great light and the feeding has also been perfect no real complaints there at all whatsoever I think the only thing that I really wanted to complain about I think with how the plants you know not having to deal with the light you know light bulb going out at everybody but with the plants themselves we did or we have had plants that are consuming a lot more water than others so it is difficult you know to keep them on a unified watering but aside from that guys it has just been absolutely spectacular the the regimen that I use to vog you know obviously the every 16 basis combined with advanced and botanic here a little bit of GH additives you know basically the mixed I've talked about in previous videos it does incredibly well for blue dream and that's pretty much what I anticipated as well you know obviously with the SF EOG being as finicky as it is whatever really does well for that is obviously going to be really good for the blue dream which is a plant that just you know seems to probably it just does good on anything really you know I know a lot of other people that run different feed regimens that get similar results so this is just a really kick-ass strain one thing to that we're changing up here at the end is that we are starting flushing a little bit earlier I'd mentioned I think in my previous video that we didn't update from here that I wanted to try to sneak in one more full-strength feeding but that is just not gonna happen day 70 is gonna be I believe the second to last day of the month and that's what we plan to take these things and that's generally what always gets it done so with that being said I decided to instead start just flushing the plants that would give us about 11 or so days of flushing maybe a little more I lost the exact account but we are gonna be able to get at least I think three you know full-blown freshwater inches through these plants heavy floodings and remember the last reservoir that was fed the plants wasn't tapered down and we did not put any Spikers in that either so after we gave the the plants that really big full strength feeding with basically all the additives you know the highest ppm single feeding the next taper down or the you know the diluted reservoir had no additive Spikers and then we're leading these things right into the flush so definitely gonna do a good job of getting all the nutrients out whatever salt buildup sand accumulations that might be there they're gonna pretty much be gone and then the plant should ripen pretty well we should see a lot more yellowing in the leaves and they'll be ready to come down here guys in just a little bit so that is pretty much it guys for this video update next view update we will definitely be going over to over HQ to check out all the new stuff that you've been doing we have done some drastic changes to the setup it's been it's been the first time we've done stuff like this in a while so it's gonna be really exciting guys check out the new production facility and to see how many clones we can produce guys is in its pre massive you know as we build out pretty much the largest you know nursery open to the public and also Cal so thanks all for watching see you all next time [Music] you", "XtxiWKuthRY": "here is a blue dream which was had some clones taken off of it last night actually and it's looking pretty good i filmed it pruned it about three days ago you can see where I kind of made some cuts the tops here and the undergrowth looks like it's growing pretty strong you can see that right there kind of coming through and the plants sturdy it looks healthy doesn't look like we have any nutrient lockout I'm not going to take any more clones off this one and maybe give it three more weeks here in veg and hopefully it'll build out a little more and get a little bigger and be real strong and it's looking really nice", "suxqYjhkLgs": "good morning everybody or actually evening everybody my name is nicola dickens this is free my cure welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel whichever case may be i got something sprinkled oh my glasses okay so today we are reviewing blue dream um from nature's medicine um again it's in one of those collectors jars didn't open it or nothing until just now and we're gonna open this bad boy up oh i got the sticker i like getting the sticker on some of these because as i have it in my journals i can put them around however because they do track a lot of what this does so this gives me the actual tag as to what this blue dream is where i got it from batch numbers all of that stuff so i keep a lot of that stuff in my my review journals just so that way i have more reference i've reviewed over 500 different strains of cannabis to date um i think i've done the entire arizona state of arizona as far as dispensaries go i do want to start getting in touch with some caregivers and working with some of them to get some education out and get you know everything going that way especially because prop 207 passed and we have um recreational marijuana so let's see what we got here so this is blue dream by nature's medicine it's a little lemony sweet a little dank so not bad let's take a look at what we got here here are the buds nice little green gold i need a couple different greens and then gold but that's very interesting so yes all right so one of the reasons why i do that especially with my camera this way is because if there's anything like molds or sand or heaven forbid glass put any of those things once you have it in the light and you're turning it especially if you zoom in on your camera um your camera mode it does detect a lot of that stuff so that's a grander upping go to good cute [Music] so my grinder was getting a bit sticky and hard to turn earlier to get it cleaned out so i cleaned it up and re it um i grease ours with coconut oil it does help make it a little bit easier to get through to not having your buds and that that sticky ooey gooey yumminess clogging up so let's see what we got yeah i guess there's some pinks in here but mostly greens and golds with a little a little light dusting of pink or it's just a reflection off my grinder it's a little dry well it's a little lot dry as always guys foot cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression [ __ ] face diapers it was a good and out the bad i don't know if any of y'all have heard or noticed anything out there um but i hear they're starting to close down the marijuana borders and starting to charge a double tax and i can't remember what they called the tax it's under the same type of a premise that here in arizona we have the blm tax it's the that same general idea so uh yeah if you notice it your bills start getting a little bit more or even at the medical dispensary that your your you know whatever you normally buy is now more expensive that would be why definitely need a water bomb that burns the throat so blue dream it is a cross between blueberry and hate and haze haze strains she is a 60 40

bedroom and we're going to do an eight week review I have a beer with me today some blue dreams that we're going to review so pretty pretty pretty Oh with flower one of the things that I do check as far as the flower goes if I like to pull it apart and listen for the snap there should always be a snap when it does that I also want to look at the density and how sticky the tight buns are on my favorite with most cannabis you can actually take a piece of the cannabis hi how are you and you can just eat it and there are medical benefits for that as well however I am gonna flip this sucker up in the grinder that we are not moving so let's see here we have blue dream oh gee Blue Dream of Jeannie comes from sorry about that are you guys doing today nice catchy name are you okay so we have our blue dreams who the dream is a sativa dominant hybrid originating in California it has achieved legendary status romana join Hugo legendary status among the west coast's trains crossing a blueberry indigo with a sativa phase Blue Dream balances full body relaxation with gentle Sabri will serve Sabri Bowman you can't ever say the word still too much what I think I look at that some Blue Dream phenotypes express a more indicolite look and feel but the sativa leaning variety remains mostly prevalent prevalent with a sweet berry aroma growth hub of this of it's blueberry parent Blue Dream delivers with symptom to relief without heavy sedate of effects this makes Blue Dream a popular day treat date buy medicine for patients treating pain depression not death and other ailments requiring a high THD brain strength yeah that's what they need right now and as you know with the cannabis that I just ate you do actually get the sweet flavor out of the cannabis itself you don't really taste the blueberry or a very tight but you do taste the sweetness and more of a citrusy type of the base today [Music] very good you can taste the blueberry very very much so yeah this does have a strong it's very sweet it doesn't hit the back of your throat like some of the pepper eat mine does [Music] in it so I'm starting to feel it I can feel my body relaxed I do have a little bit of us like a heat flash coming on so it's not bad [Music] [Music] so yeah this one not I don't really feel it too much in my head so my anxiety is still a little high I have energy my body's calming down so yeah I can see where this would be a great one for pain you might need that added with a little something if you need it for the anxiety and they don't see that dirt I don't feel too much of a change there but overall it's got a great taste it I don't taste any chemicals so this this is a good review so the plant was rinsed very well it's got a good flavor no habla espanol exciting I but I'm not multi-talented in languages so I'm sorry definitely a good strain I will upload my written review underneath this down there if you have not subscribed to my channel yet please hit that subscribe button send it out to friends share it let's get this channel poppin this is for other cancer patients let's get the word out there I will be back on for one last live this afternoon or

flees strain spotlight check back here next week for another fresh look at the cannabis industry see you soon you", "qG3MTyTGDDI": "what's going on everybody's hi Gravatt lights just turned on hopefully you guys can make out to the dead of death definition of yellowing basically what I do is try and shoot for like an autumn in New York effect it's where you start seeing you know full full fall effect orange dropping leaves just as it would normally happen in mother nature and multi colors if you can achieve lower temperatures in your room you will get like pinkish purples and you know various colors mixed in with the leaves it really looks pretty I like to refer as I like autumn in New York to you know if you've ever been to New York in the autumn in the fall it's kind of what it looks like very pretty you know if you can achieve lower temperatures and kind of trick the plant into thinking it's fall time so this is what it is the lights are just kind of turning on and starting to warm up and do what I need to do is get this bad boy or does dirty bits I'm gonna get this [ __ ] right here that's what she looks like all over you see from the definition of trichomes how it looks like it's kind of snowy that's because all the glands are solid milky and either amber so at this point I just need to get this one down and out of here so we can move on with our next rotation we are going to be throwing dump dump done the UK cheese my favorite strain guys it's very I would say out of all the plants that I've ever had the flower ever flower that's definitely the most pickiest and it's it's definitely cheese is not a beginner strain well at least my Fino isn't they don't like heavy set of nutrients they're like very low-key mild doses of everything and they're very magnesium and calcium hungry so keep that in mind if you got the UK cheese the hardest thing about growing that plant is in transition the first three weeks of flipping your 12:12 photo period so I can't wait to get that in there so I can get the grapefruit crush here and get on with you know I also got that big-ass Northern Lights back there that's gonna be a six foot plant by the time one of these comes out but I'm gonna focus on keeping the health of that plant perfect until that time comes and then once what's gonna happens and once this one we this replaces a blue dream that replaces the suit ss SDH and then that big one will go here because it's kind of outgrowing its little space and then I'll work on getting jack hair and purple in D up we're gonna do a purple blood run the buds are solid purple that's it so you can see what she looks like I mean frickin footlong colors everywhere and I'm not gonna be using a bowl trimmer on this I haven't picked off any fan leaves but you guys can see you know the leaves are dying back rather fast now let's take a whiff of these buds with me yep blue drain blueberry select you there's nothing intense it's not gonna overpower your the the original you know scents and aromas of your cannabis it's not what I intended by putting that video up but then but the the intense intensity of the effect does get you know more intense the longer you run it and the higher dosage is if you're adding flavoring enhancers such as general hydroponics or the baking oils and stuff extracts I really can't wait to keep this thing out of here and move on toasty covered little trichomes everywhere carbon filters did great that's another one that I just made that's the the one that's got about a pound in it at least a pound of a carbon and it does really well homemade carbon filters haven't been able to smell neither one of these plants and any stage of growth throughout the grow and that was rather pleasing experience so and I'm I was also running up ona gel too at the same time and that stuff really really kicks ass so if you got a really stinky plant I want a gel in the carbon possibly ozone generator to that Cola right there is like the mother mother lode and this one's the double cherry on top you can see that guy's just chunky fat bode [ __ ] break it down for you he starts there and goes all the way down there so and it's like that that effect is all over the plant so what I'm going to do is finish up this video here what I would like to do is uh oh yeah this is side buzz it way out here you know take a lot of photos so I can make a collage video another side bud larger buds are centralized like these ones here I still got a lot hanging down there's all kinds of colas is hanging then draping down over here I can't even get them up I think they might be tied down I'm not too sure so yeah I want to take a collage of photos and possibly do like collage skit with a song I like to do that it's kind of cool for the people that don't want to watch videos I like to just to see a badass plant finished I don't have weekly photos that was my intention initially is to take weekly photos but I did what I did do is I took maybe even the first four weeks photos maybe three weeks maybe a photo here and there nothing too serious I didn't really stay on top of that just lack of time really haven't spent too much time in this room with these plants other than trying to get the room reset and prepare for the next grow I want you guys to know that we are gonna be making the baddest recirculating DWC system that you've ever seen made here live on this channel and something a system better designed and probably I'll go over the total cost and products and everything you need to every piece you need to have in order to make a system just like what I'm gonna show you here I would say that the total cost with the pump is under 100 bucks do it yourself I'm gonna show you all the tools you need all the plumbing parts Adam how it works how to hook it up rather simple if you're the least bit handiest with holes you can easily do this and follow along so I've designed quite a few manifolds and recirculating systems in the past and initially when my first grow was recirculating and I used that system for quite a while and sold it and dabbled back and forth between containers and solo hydro buckets so and nmt I've been to nmt what else have I done I've done a lot you know I even gave soil a shot which I thought was indoors was completely worthless she's starting to pack on the weight here you can see the nice stacking effect she's about three and a half weeks in I'd say I haven't really been keeping too far I could just tell oh gee gosh too nice so yeah it's like a freebie right here in the middle you know Oh update that last plant guys at Northern Lights that was in the middle that was four and a quarter ounce free be free be no dedicated light just sitting here in the middle being run for free I know this is a container for plant but you know it's drain to waste I do the best with it and almost EPM meter kicking on so yeah I do the best with it and I only run the container in the middle because if this plant was a hydro bucket it would be another one of these and I don't have that much space so I have to keep it small and tight and compact so I mean look at this thing's gonna be a heavy monster I mean we're at three three week three halfway it's already starting to put the bend in the branches so that's cool it's know let's get on with this I'm gonna take it down start trimming her up pulling all these leaves off let her hang and I will just give you guys an update you know so basically let's take a branch like this is like these this is a family and I'll do this when I have gloves on really fast-paced so just just pull it off start pulling all these fan leaves off and they kind of they're all yellow no so it's coming down guys all right Tigra hybrid I'm gonna give you update here one saw this bow boys down probably give you guys a little intermittent update because this is gonna take a long time so that's unstrap these yo-yos get this thing under strong unweave and cut down the branches are so thick that you have to use a bypass a bypass pruner I mean we're talking about branches thick and these are rated for up to one inch and this is this branch right here's one one and a half inch easy talk about the base right here so you can see how small these bypass pruners are compared to this badass bowie trunk right there so blanket of buds aka high grow hybrid theory stay tuned ma'am I'll be right back there you go guys one solid bud you guys idea so have you look at wanting to stand up it's a flapper that was a double cherry so you guys not look at this that was a double cherry for you guys this is what topping does for you so instead of getting one tall gigantic Cola that just lacks penetration towards the bottom of the bud get a shorter more beefier bud because it kept it rather stout and more light was able to penetrate the bud those giving you more weight in larger buds look at all the work I got to do I just cut that one bud my hair oh I cut down one more I'm gonna show you [Music] again top it doop-doop do you get one two three four this is a quad topping off of one stem sim holding right there one two three four five is actually five so that's what topping does as opposed to just getting one symmetric Cola from bottom to top you will get multiple posts and a fuller canopy that's what you're shooting for is a very very full canopy all right I'm gonna start chopping it down as the third one that I just heard down she won't even breaking the stem is breaking the stem right half her look how big she is put my fist next to the sink where he goes they we spend two and I have a big [ __ ] hand it's not the normal hand my fist is huge dude so there you go bud how we do it man I keep I'm gonna be taking a series of videos so you guys there's another one bigger than my best from top to bottom all on one branch this is what topping does top your plants guys it will increase your yields 20 25% easy so nice [Music] we show you what this subside [Music] hopefully you guys can make that out white solid white looks like silver frickin bad gigantic pods it's going over the structure there's [ __ ] 12 inches for you man right there that's what she said oh my god okay that thanks full see guys no this is how much plant we got left I haven't even started barely chipping away the surface haha shipping out her man shipping the why it's beautiful say I gots about maybe roughly a third not even probably not even that may about 30% the nine thirty percent and 25 percent yeah there's a whole lot of Wade [Music] all right we're a little bit into it you can see that we're chopping away I'm probably on my third tub this is what I mean by third tub okay and yes big [ __ ] buds dude giant bazooka colors I'll I'll break out some off photos ward done Sherman toss up and I'd say we probably got another half the plant it's maybe 40% left and like I said we're on my third tub and things are getting kind of full so I'm glad I bought these little things right here they actually serve as a really nice holding you know container for you for your matter for your products when you're trimming it bringing it to the table you know I mean so it's working really really nice all right man busting my ass so we're almost there oh my god I don't even know what I'm gonna do with that thing but I haven't listed the the employment of another individual helping me so it's coming rather along rather nicely and I appreciate the help be back soon was going down to MERS an exciting day for me because we are so the date is May 12 technically it's made for the day would be May 4th we got about 30% left on the plant and I've taken most of the yo-yos down and what yo-yos you see all the buds are just kind of hanged and flopped over on their side like dead fishes so you know some of this stuff's still standing up and the most that stuff back there it's all big floppers but down on their side so it's what we got I'm going to show you all what one plant one plant one bulb one strain will do it for you I don't even know if you guys can grasp the concept of this bucket right here see how long you can hold that horizontally in the air [ __ ] a beer mug give me a bucket of buds so yeah you can see uh oh yeah baby there's some freaking monster freakin buds you can see these things in here this is we got about another 30% good to go so add another 30% to this and that's where what we've said and I can tell you none of this is no more this is gonna fit in here now we're already looking like this okay yes so I'm gonna take you might take all this I'm gonna put it on a table for you guys so you guys can really get the perspective of what one of these full of weed really looks like like laid out on a table oh here we go guys managers get some orders [ __ ] out of my way poor poor lighting oh yeah it's called tricks of the trade it's just kind of bad shy call us Oh terrible idea he's gonna do this for you guys I'm in this big fat wanker right here yeah just gets deeper deeper beautiful like a buzz right here it's a real beautiful purple one to just probably can't catch all the colors blow my shot you which way do y'all think this is and we still got about another 30% left I would say it's a pound and a half easy goddamn [ __ ] your hair there's several of these everywhere yeah all the whole plans like that actually I'm gonna say the entire plant is like this there's a [ __ ] footlong for you it's our plant man I think all of us upon colas it is - is it monster one toe sorry I can't do any blood porn with it with these lighting conditions so that's gonna have to wait this is a monster [ __ ] bud right here check this one out say well yeah so I'm talking about there's another one of those you don't get this growing soil here's a double cherry guys everybody wanted to know what that was that's it I'm gonna show you what it looks like in the palm of my hand that's a big [ __ ] bud sort of loose I can also split up between your fingers monster dude wants to lighting is really bad in here actually all of this looks purple I let it ripen all so much it all looks purple you know it doesn't look like you can tell that through the the view lens you know just breaks this is a nice one two bricks it's like Mount Everest you know a bouquet of buds so y'all tell me how much that is that's all our air was a sigh but Wow let me just pretty thing here we could take y'all on the light hopefully that'll brighten things of them it looks like the camera is doing like a auto white balance or something that's not really what I wanted to look like because here and here between my eye and the camera lens is totally different hopefully y'all can see that I got to give it out you know 95 percent of this is a is a trimmed up so [Music] all like that man more double cherries total cherries what is it double cherry go was my other double cherries if you guys aren't pinching your tops and running double cherries when you're flowering your plants you're missing out on another 20 look at this big-ass wanker right here you guys are missing out on 20 at least 20 25 percent here harvies wait so where did that double cherry go there's so much weed here and it's beautiful there's a a double topped double cherry so I was like 2 1 hit 1 2 3 4 [Music] IRA's I said don't share everybody was always talking about so we got some sugar leaf to trim up when I do the the final trim for now this is a this is done until we do the the final pedicure the vital manicuring oh yeah it's right there pigs my hand I don't know you tell me guys got this my my hash trimmings big-ass bucket full of these so this is what we got show you one more time damn this is phenomenal yeah look at the [ __ ] size of this day it's big as my CAC help so voila in a state tune we we still got 30% to go I'm gonna get that to another day though I can't do all this in one sitting it actually wasn't that bad look at that oh my god it's just sickening sickening I tell you we serve them by the stick you know we serve them by the state damn alright ma'am I just showed you guys the plan upstairs so I'm gonna let that sit like that for you don't know to whenever I have the time to get around it say to you think the harvest you're looking at right now is [ __ ] creme de la creme this is even gonna be better this is better seat up peek in the back that won't weigh back there not that bud goes from there all the way down to this canopy right here oh yeah that's how we're all over here in this [ __ ] sorry ma'am I'm a bit excited so I hope you guys can uh share some of the excitement with me and that's why I make these videos you know some bunker wankers back here give these big flappers it's full [ __ ] right here Oh goddamn yeah so we're working on it we still got about another thirty percent you know on this plan right here let us sit here for another couple days let some of these uh lower buds I didn't get too much light well they got light but not as not like the top so we're gonna let them have go ahead and catch up but you know I'll come back in here tomorrow and pull this big monster right here that thing Jesus feed me Seymour freed me oh my God look at these things that one needs to come up come up [ __ ] that's what the yo-yos are for man see even the yo-yo has a hard time pulling on that much weight it's just [ __ ] man it's only 25 pound test do you know we got a lot to go still about 30 percent and take you over here so what we're doing oh yeah it's how we throw down in this [ __ ] yeah as y'all can tell I'm sorry I'm decided I'm about to go frigging I'm done I'm just gonna go freakin play some music for the rest of the day and finish off the evening with some or some drinks some cocktails I just want to show y'all this is how we do one plant one ball one strike I don't know one plus pound you know I honestly I don't I don't ever really weigh everything unless I'm really kind of doing numbers for you guys so yeah I'm looking forward to actually win this [ __ ] out I don't even have a scale I don't even keep a scale by law my medical card I'm not allowed to keep a scale around my my medical anything to do with my medical cannabis it's just one of their corks I cannot own a scale or even have a scale anywhere around my my medical grow so that's [ __ ] but you know it is what it is and I ain't taking any chances I never will so about the only chance I take is a share of my successful info with you so if anybody's gonna [ __ ] charge me with any crimes you know knowledge is the most scariest [ __ ] [ __ ] on earth so that's the only problem I could see ever in my future is sharing success and bringing success of equivalents to everybody else subscribe so subscribe go ahead and throw all this down and get on with my day but I'll get back to you all tomorrow over in a few days when I finish up the rest this video is gonna be a updated you know late later or when everything's finished so what everything finishes when you guys will see this good day now so you know guys I'm thinking I might beat my record number there's a 600 watt bulb for anybody that doesn't know that just if you guys are just coming in right now and you're seeing this this is done with a 600 watt watt bulb squat so yes I think I might have beat my record number this could be pushed in to peace if not more I still got another 30 percent which would be probably about this level right here so almost equivalent to the I've got a bucketful pretty much I know that's over a pound that's probably pushing a pound and a half easy and we still got another 30 percent to go I'm I might just beat my best crow ever and in this series so I was glad to have been able to do it on camera with you guys and I haven't done DWC in a while you got back at some of my first girls that I ever uploaded on the channel they were DWC I have a couple on there one of them is uh Northern Lights and the other one is OG Kush I think the other another one is a cheese so I got three on there I got oh gee cush scrog that [ __ ] she's the inch cheesy 40 inch scrog and then what else do I got and I got the OG Kush our OG Kush cheesy scrog and the Northern Lights and big butt so y'all check those old grows out but those groves were good those were [ __ ] badass crows this one doubles that and so I'm gonna get back to y'all in a few days continuing on guys what we're gonna do is I'm going to show you guys the root zone and then we're going to get rid of this plant we need to get this out of here and get ourselves set up with the the new and upcoming series of how to design fabricate and build a recirculating DW system following that is going to be how to grow our DW c aka or excuse me how to grow recirculating deep water culture aka our DW c so I'm going to pull this plan out here and put it in a 5 as you can see that a plant has been in the plant our equipment has been shut down for a few days I would like to get things that are gigantic look at this gigantic plant back here one plant one class two plants as a third big one good things come in three alright so push I haven't really really stare at the root zone and see what the overall helpless in the plant I mean overall undercarriage I gotta go the plant was healthy and in all aspects because the grow was out absolutely beautiful we didn't have that you're no problems at all gigs out here guys segments so take this set this here then set gallon bucket on top of that and just like so and I'm gonna pull that out plan out I'll show you guys the roots and we're gonna get rid of that that's [ __ ] have you do it this [ __ ] root zone is big I can't pull that we can run out like that find out why oh my yeah oh [ __ ] look at those [ __ ] roots [ __ ] no I care for targets it falls out that's fine let's look at this Wow look at those it's like Merlin's beard look at this guy's Oh [ __ ] still healthy this is your this is what you want to do during your grow oh look at all these feeder roots all feeder roots guys there's the hydroponic water farm kit and taste and roots I mean what I have to do it and look at all the the adapting continuing water roots here great thick there's about as thick as a pencil and Wow I believe it let me get that back lunch right but I got to lift this thing out completely get out of here know what it was right to miss Rowe is coming down we're gonna be continuing on now the inside of your hard to take would look like that I'll root it up just like a dirt plan it's just something like some kind of container plant and here's my solo cup look how [ __ ] big how big this is [ __ ] trunk is guys we're talking about a 600 watt bulb I'm talking about thousand thousands I'm talking it's one 600 watt bulb through this baby okay now you're gonna take it I'll show you what it compares to a five-gallon bucket how's it fit you work this [ __ ] down look at all these roads oh my gosh okay now that's what I mean more space that's why we used this container for the roots to flower this plan more route more fruit more fruit more yields in your harvest look at the distant roads are phenomenal my god oh man I'm excited about that that is just terrific happy to take you out the tripod because the Beast has been released I'm going to show you what the water conditions have been like and let's take me to the air stops - everything splits here guys for air stones look how nice and clean these air stones are mid grow we dropped our Orca which is our pennies we ran beneficials all the way up to about we I want to say roughly week for at week four we drop their beneficials and we continued from that point on see for the for the health of the plant to run hydrogen peroxide to keep this root mass because we seem to not clog putting out massive amounts of air that's one so let's take a look at the other one that's attached to that Chi spotless it's got a little dead root matter on there right there what you can see it's still beautiful let's take a look at one of the other stones a little bit of buildup of dead root matter but still a good is bubble in a way perfect like brand-new that's the hydrogen peroxide working for you the hydrogen peroxide also maintains a sterile root zone after week four to keep your plant from going into any kind of a shock also providing it with lots of oxygen keeping it healthy because you know you're killing the plants you know guys and flour when you in theory know that once you flip your photo Pierre you are killing your plant before the stone looks perfect I don't even have to clean these guys so I'll rinse them off nonetheless so all unplugs got later I have two ants but you can see the the amount of air and I run those large coke bottle air stones as they have more surface area and they put off air so what this is the air that we've been having the last over ten weeks or so and uh everything's beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful couldn't ask for any better perfect grow this grow was one hundred percent six six fast soothe successful with now that all the weed has been drying and it is dried it is actually already into its a curing stage just be a you know the way that I Iran the room temperature is with the the humidity it's finally curing stages and the glass jars and I'll put that in there for an additional week and this is what we got yeah this tub full and this tub is they're full and pretty dense sticky gooey nugs it's really pretty heavy what we're gonna do is give a purchase clip all the flowers off of the the main stems and put them into the final jars for its final curing and let it sit there for a week everything will be nice and uniform and consistent with the moisture from you know the outside and the inside out and that's basically what we're looking for and in the end you don't want the flower to be crusty or spindly if you dry too fast it's gonna be spindly if you dry too too slow it's potentially get mold it's kind of like there's a happy medium in there and I like to leave this stuff on the racks for about a week and set the this is basically what I run the temperature and humidity up and the 24 50% I live in a dry climate you guys know that I don't mind putting up with you so what we're gonna do now is put it away and get everything clipped off with these main stems here there's definitely a pound here I just there's definitely over a pound they're just curious actually if I actually hit the 1.5 pound mark I don't think I did but nevertheless there's over a pound okay I got one plant so we did rather well and I'm totally pleased with it you know I thought it was at least one and a half but you know I never know I just don't I just don't know until it's actually all it could be 1/2 I mean I just I'm just me speculating on [ __ ] but I don't have a skill so I have to actually go borrow somebody's scale bring it and bring it and then weigh it out because I'm gonna loud to keep a scale and I grow can they believe that that's just the law here so it doesn't matter what I do gotta do is get it all the way out you know get it in jars and get fully cured which generally takes at least 7 to an additional 7 to 10 days sometimes I like to go another 14 days with a cure and what that does is it further come-come packs the flowers together and makes them even more manageable and it's just overall nice and parents and that's what everybody looks for they like nice flowers and you know they don't like super dense but they don't like spindly where it's like crumbling apart in their fingertips so there's this step fine those fine little lines you know it's a it's just a process to something that you're gonna have to get used to you may not get it right your first a second time but you'll get it right by your third time it's not an art but you can turn it into an art if you really wanted to like aging whiskey and wine and things like that you know twelve-year-old Scotch slower put the older the better but the my drawing process of curing usually takes at least minimum 14 days so all right I'm gonna get this done and I'll see you guys in seven to ten days", "XFnXj78bX54": "all right what's up everybody you may know me ed efed is right here about to hit the gym but before we do I want to go ahead and do a quick little review of the Pacific stone and so behind the story is I had a budget of $20 I wanted to go to the dispensary just get something I don't want to get a pre-roll because usually get a grand pre-roll for twelve dollars or more and so I wanted to get something a lot more than that and this is a new brand that I've never seen before I tried it out and let me tell you I am very pleased with this purchase now right off the bat when I opened up the bag the scent was amazing but what gommi was there seemed to be more cannabis in the package than a lot of other products that I've tried and usually I'll guess I'll be like this doesn't look like 3.5 or does it look like 3.5 I don't know this time I was like man that looks like at least four four and a half grams and it was only $20 and I was satisfied with that because I had enough to roll a couple blunts do a couple of joints and it's a really simple sativa it's about 14% THC so you're not gonna get super blown it allows you to be a lot of creative focused and a little bit less of the anxiety you're not gonna be tripping out or getting too wild it's still a little bit wet it's not fully dried in my opinion I think you could go a little bit longer it does look like it's outdoor though it had what I think are little eggs little bug eggs which I grow organic outdoor so for me that doesn't bug me I know there's no way around it you can't fight all the bugs off the only way to get that is if you go all indoor and that's where you're gonna they're gonna be paying more money I'm sorry you're gonna pay at least thirty five enough for indoor I think I don't know and that's the dispensary pricing honestly this whole this whole package this whole product I love it it's so well worth it I was really pleased and you're gonna be high fare a little under two hours I clocked in about an hour and a half and I still felt it throughout you know the two hours but it's not gonna be strong all the way through you're gonna be high and then after 20-30 minutes you're gonna start coming down and you're just gonna chill out so it's really for beginner or just a budget-friendly budget conscious consumers and I would recommend it especially if you just need extra weed maybe you're gonna share it with some friends or you're gonna want weed that you rollin blunt because not everybody wants to roll $50.00 eighth we insult blunt because then that's just gonna go by like quick so that's in case you want a little bit of extra definitely definitely recommend it I'm gonna go ahead and hit it for you guys really earthy flavor for sure when I smoked it in the blunt it was mixed with the tobacco so you know you get a little bit of that blunt flavor having smoked this by itself in this bubbler it's tasty really earthy really Punk knit smooth and I think with outdoor cannabis especially organic cannabis you're not getting headaches afterwards like some wheat if you get a headache or maybe if it's not ashed white and it's ashli black it's there's still nutrients there's still chemicals inside and with this I mean it's this last thing a while it's not hasn't even asked you yeah that's it's turning a little bit white it's strong it's really strong bud you're not gonna be over the moon but it's definitely gonna get you to where you need to be I feel like I'm cross-eyed because I'm looking at this one lens and I'm just like okay for $20 it's honestly a good deal you're not gonna go wrong with this Mika's it'll strain us on the throat one of the things that I did see as well is it's not trimmed perfectly it's a budget weed so you're gonna get leaves here and there and that's a okay I don't have a problem with that if it was about fifty sixty dollars I would be very very critical of it but not with this you can't be you can't expect everything final opinion on the Pacific so in orange sativa is it's worth it it's worth the price it's really good it's great quality you could taste it it smells amazing I got more wheat than I anticipated and it's all at twenty dollars this is probably the one honestly one of the greatest purchases that I felt satisfied with because there was so much in a bag I did not expect to see that much weed when I opened it and it is decent you know so don't be afraid to try it it's super cheap if you want to just have a blunt that's a good one if your share with homies get that one and keep the good good to yourself self alright guys that's all I got for today I hope you guys enjoyed that remember follow out Eddie FM deals on everything if you guys

evaluating blue dream from the cannabis club lifted 420 located in delightful San Francisco for the price I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised with the end result lifted cause this their economical weed although the nugs were all pretty small the trichomes or crystals on the Strand look pretty startling blue dream smelled very sweet and wholesome the flavor was a bit rough and somewhat brassy but the strength was very powerful a spirited strain that really packs a punch for only thirty dollars a name once the bull was finished I felt medicated right away very psychoactive but not to stone and exceptionally up pleasant and happy filling overall I rate blue dream a 3 out of 5 based on price smell taste and strength my final review for the price you get a little more than what you would expect if it only tasted a bit better than I'd say this is a true steel thank you for your views and if you have any questions comments or concerns leave them down below my question for you is what is a blue dream", "9JB_23A0FxA": "hello hello everybody and i've been working in the fish room pretty much all holiday weekend and i was wanting to make a video and this is the next item on the list is to get a 40 gallon blue dreams tank a little bit more under control this moss is taking over the whole tank the retal is getting out of control and the good thing about these shrimp tanks is low light low-tech just moss and some easy super easy stem plants in this tank in particular super easy to take care of but you do got to take you do you got to control the plants man that's a good looking shrimp right there if it would focus because i'm trying to call some shrimp [Music] this weekend different lines and i went started to grab the net started getting this one and we've got overgrown getting hard to do so i'm going to try to get this tank a bit more manageable i don't really plan on taking anything out other than really maybe trimming some stem plants but that's what's on the agenda is to get i'd say about you gotta turn the stem plants every couple of months and then the moss if you really thin it out good it seems like that's a once every six months to once in a year project so that's what i'm going to try to tackle now blue dream shrimp tank plant management let's see what we come up with [Music] so we're still in the middle of this you know that retala i trimmed off and everything stirred up now but now there is a bunch of bare substrate where there wasn't before and we can see the shrimp a whole lot better and now it's going to be a whole lot easier for me to catch out the bad ones you call it so let's get it cleaned up get all these things gonna be trickies look at this i gotta you know basically take out each stem out at a time shake it off and put it out so make sure you get all the shrimp off this thing is always so hard to record because of the glare yeah i got someone to take out of here that's for sure [Music] not too bad well let's see if we can get this cleaned up a little bit and get it looking a little better [Music] okay this is what we ended up with like i said i've done all this in probably like 15 minutes so not a huge deal [Music] and this will probably more likely be [Music] other than trimming yeah like i said i kind of did a not a throw job clearing out the moss like there's a big old wad of moss growing right there [Music] but that's all right and we still got retal leaves everywhere that's all right too but now we've got this this was moss all the way grown up and now we have less than half of it being covered in moss and probably about half so that's what we got so now [Music] the next video [Music] i should say here lately i've been having people ask me what is my secret to get my shrimp population so big now i've always discovered for me first off is just if you're going to do a shrimp tank just do a shrimp tank pluck those wrestlers plecos they're fine they're not going to do anything to shrimp but if you try keeping guppies or antlers or whatever any kind of trying to put shrimp in a community tank more than likely [Music] yoga shrimp population does just fine but then unfortunately you're not gonna get him to do super good everything eats baby shrimp i don't care other than plecos any pretty much and not even all plecos are shrimp safe i'd imagine the bristles plecos are my experience anything tetris guppies mollies tiger barbs angelfish pretty much all the popular if it fits it gets ate that's a good thing and then [Music] lots of plants lots of hiding places moss formed a grayson some stem plants to keep nitrates down the moss does that too keep most down or lots of plants and moss keep the water parameters nice and stable and healthy [Music] and then i also there's a lot of people that don't even feed the shrimp they might throw in a couple leaves in there every month or something for them to eat but i throw in this tank gets fed as much as i would if you're fishing here man maybe not quite as much but i feed my shrimp tanks a lot well because there's a lot of plecos in here to feed too but lots of food and more water changes a lot of people say only change like 10 or 20 percent of water and their shrimp tanks [Music] well once a month [Music] and this tank i get i do about 20 or 30 every week in this particular tank [Music] that tanks with more this tank ends up with more pluckers than i want so i'm not going to change more water but that's all right [Music] so hopefully this made some sense maybe it helped the person maybe it didn't it's good to see a lot of cool blue shrimp and it's not my next video but a video coming up real soon will be what i look for when i call my blue dream shrimp there's one's gonna go out for sure that's a call all right everybody thank you for watching bye", "siSHFKgfYNI": "[Music] look at this giant bud it's not giant compared to something on a stock but it's definitely giant for something that you get from a dispensary this is super blue dream and usually I would tell you that I don't like super blue dream I've tried it a lot a lot of times and it's not my thing it but this time I ordered I never even ordered it because I wouldn't order it but it came as a a extra gift from goddess delivers and it's incredible so I reordered the product and they sent me this big bud so I ordered a half an ounce of this so you can see the quality of the product that you get and this flower was awesome it's a sativa it's a mix of super Silver Haze and blue dream it's very happy it's a clear-headed it's energizing it's got a great taste and you can focus and you know a lot of times but these kind of flowers you lose focus this one you have great focus it is very very very strong I like it so today we're going to review it we want to look we're looking for the best we just had a little little bit to try so now I ordered a bunch we'll see if this new batch has game this is super blue dream from goddess delivers and by the way this goddess delivers I go to dispensaries all the time and generally they really have a very good flower compared to other places you don't have to go anywhere and so let's check it out this is super blue dream out of the vapor Cup you can see it's at 3:30 should be ready to go super blue dream a super blue dream has a very good flavor and prior back just always made me feel a little racy so I didn't like it but the last batch of this I am from goddess delivers was just so good I'm gonna share this with a bunch of my friends see if they get the same feeling that I do at weed entertainment.com we are looking for the best very smooth great taste so what do I give super blue dream on the one-to-ten scale people call me the doctor because I really know a lot about marijuana and it's not just about that it's about there's so many different strange and to go into the dispensary and you're looking to buy how do you know which one to buy so we're looking for the people that have got the good flowers there were always the same you can count on them being good I think this is really a solid eight five that's unbelievable to be a ten it's got to be yeah and I would say this is their but I would say it's almost there maybe this is even a nine so I'm gonna give it an eight point five to nine which is really high on the scale and I can't say that about most super blue dreams it's only this one from goddess delivers and I've tried this a lot of times I would never buy some really green but if you have to change my mind I'm gonna be opened up this lady has or guy whoever goddess delivers is they really have a great product if you've never seen them you can see them online the reason I tried this company is because they had a product that I wanted to try that I hadn't tried before and they had it and it's great nice delivery people are deliberate or nice do I recommend it highly recommend it goddess deliver super blue green party on my friends is the doctor you [Music]", "-H-mgRMxs08": "all right guys what's going on so i'm back with another video man it's another straight interview for you guys happy friday by the way uh by the time of me recording this it is currently let me see here 9 52 october 27th today's tuesday i don't know why i didn't say it in the proper order but who cares let's get into this strain review man today if you guys cannot tell i am probably going to be the most excited you'll ever see me in a video because i even smoked blue dream in a minute if you guys don't know i think i've talked about this in some past story times blue dream was the very first time that i ever smoked in terms of legal cannabis which basically means not from street dealers and [ __ ] where you can get your stuff laced i ain't about that life hopefully you aren't either so let's get it going this is also the joint that i had from wednesday's video by the way um both of which were recorded today on the same exact day um i'm going to show you guys how to use the tiptuck method so i mean shout out to me um look at that perfect w let's get our sparkle actually look at that by the way really quickly before you get started let's try to toast oh my goodness not the time as i'm trying to toast the joint um one thing i want to say right off the bat and i don't talk about this enough at least i don't think i do you know i feel like i can talk about it a little bit more is the aroma that this gives off this is one of the reasons why blue dream is one of my fav one of my favorite strains and why this lighter is one of my least favorite lighters but my clippers for some reason just ain't working today i thought they were all empty i refilled all of them none of them are lighting now so i'm kind of kind of annoyed by that but um when i say your aroma i'm talking normally but now that i've lit it but just out the bag dude that gassy kind of citrusy lemony kind of blueberry kind of you know smell just first puff of blue dream in about a year first hit i'm really not tasting too much now i try to keep things 100 to you guys i have no reason to lie i did not pay for this this was sent out by power plant health which is where i've been getting my weed from ever since i started here uh started videos here on youtube with the metro weed man which as of right now if you guys are watching the video it might it might be called the the toronto stoner i'm switching it back to the metro weed man i just prefer that name better it just rolls off my tongue a little bit more and i'm finding that i'm screwing it up and still calling myself the metro weed man i'm not the toronto stoner plus stalking a couple of you guys and you guys said yeah the metro wingman sounds better so there we go so i'm definitely tasting a little bit of citrus a little bit of like blueberry kind of i believe blue dream derives from blueberry kush or something like that um or something with blueberry and i don't know exactly what strain is i almost 100 sure this is a hybrid i always say this i i should it'll all be nominal in the description um in terms of my description of the strain uh in the you know for the video and the power plant helps us about and all that stuff i'm really liking it so far now i'm not going to see how much they gave me because that's relevant all i'm going to say is that it's a triple a strain it goes for 135 bucks for an ounce that's right 135 canadian for an ounce 28 grams of blue dream i don't know anywhere else you're gonna find that kind of a deal i mean now unless you're getting from another wholesale another um sorry wholesaler uh you get wholesale value because the fact that they're growing it themselves which is what i meant to say um pulling up the [ __ ] heavy duty over here if you guys haven't seen this in a while have you so the last time i smoked blue dream it didn't really get me like [ __ ] up baked buzzed out high and i'm really hoping it doesn't do that this time because to be honest with you i could have smoked this in one recorder but i figured i i rolled this excuse me i rolled this on a king-sized joint for that uh tip-top tutorial so i might as well just smoke the joint then rather than letting it just sit there because i'm not smoking eventually anyway right um but as i was saying the last time i smoked blue dream i got it from the ocs which is if you guys are not familiar here in ontario canada every province and territory by the way i believe every problem is territory i don't know i'm assuming every other province and territory has something similar like the equivalent for them of what the ocs is for ontario citizens which is essentially is the provincial government's weed site if you will now there are dispensaries like storefronts and who not that are licensed through the government those are not the same as the ocs it's similar but not the same so last time i got blue dream was from the ocs and um i mean i'm really really liking it so far i really think that it's a very very big big strain if you guys are you know new to weed i would definitely recommend a sativa especially until you really get used to smoking you kind of get your tolerance you know an idea of your tolerances smoke into the weed and the effects and the terpenes i'll definitely recommend smoking a sativa maybe not maybe something that's on the lower spectrum of the thc uh percentage like something like around 17 maybe 20 um personally in my opinion be ideal for a beginner i have no idea i don't remember what strain was i think it was like 25 when i used to get it from the ocs when i used to get it from um i'm not actually going to name the dispensary because they're [ __ ] and they're no longer business that i'm aware of if you guys watch my story time talking about dispensaries you guys know what i'm talking about i think basically it's the one where they the guy would never wear the weed in front of me and always you know i felt he tried to rip me off excuse me but um i mean i'm not coughing in longer i'm coughing but it's not like you guys know when i cough i have to pause the video because you know i just i cough like an absolute grizzly bear and it just looks really weird so i mean that's that now getting back into the strain kind of came into these flavors on these terps i'm really really liking it i think percy's weed that has strong turps versus a lot of terps i prefer the one strong terps because having a lot sometimes you don't want a lot of different flavors you may want like in this case we've got a little bit of citrus a little bit of blueberry a little bit like that the actual like a weed taste if you will um and it's fairly straightforward it's not a basic strain but it's not a complex one either so again you know it's something to definitely try i would i would recommend it to really anybody who's looking to try a new strain if you haven't tried blue dream i don't know where you you probably won't do a rock or something if you haven't heard of it at least and if this lighter doesn't work with me i'm gonna get a little bit annoyed here but i'm really really liking this this especially that kind of citrusy hit i'm not sure exactly what it is um but definitely citrusy i'm smelling it a lot more um through the smoke and then just when you're again rubbing out the bag when you're you know smelling it i think we all do that thing where we grab our weed and we smell it i don't know i think it's kind of weird but i know everybody does it um i don't know what it is but i find it really cringy when i see somebody like like for instance let me use my lighter for example i'm gonna die off these fumes but they they only take the wheel the golden like they stick it practically into their [ __ ] nostrils i found that so weird because i feel like you should be able to smell it if it's that strong you should smell like this or even like a clone or a perfume you know you go like you know some people go i just like what i don't know but i should have brought some music to play then i've got my phone i just got a speaker plus it's charging anyways so excuse me i'm really really liking it it's it's burning beautifully it's resonating quite a bit as you guys i don't know if you guys can see that too well but that shine on the top of the brown is liquid gold one thing i want to say also when i was grinding the weed it was uh keeping quite a bit which is really nice to see sometimes your weed doesn't keep up too much it's not necessarily a bad thing but i mean usually when we does obviously that shows higher quality and this being and i say this a lot but this being a triple extremely extremely worth it i would say it's perfectly priced anywhere from 130 to 150 for a triple is a great deal um lower is way better obviously but like you know the chipper the cheaper you get a triple i have a tongue twister um you know better now you also got to re if you're seeing like for instance like really glued for a hundred dollars for a triple i think that's probably the best deal i ever ever ever find from price for the grade i'm yet to find a triple for less than 100 bucks i mean you know now i'm definitely definitely thinking of trying uh one of their indicas that's a five star 5a strain because i've never ever tried something like that before i'm only getting an eight so the next time i go probably next week or the week after whenever i re-up on my own excuse me i'll get an eighth and if you guys are wondering why just why again an eighth not less excuse me it's because that's the smallest quantity that powerplant sells also also before i forget if you guys go i'd i'm almost on sure it's still like going on down below will be power plants weed maps link um if you leave them a review i believe they give you a free pre-roll or something like that uh and you just i guess i think you gotta email them or you gotta message them um proof and you know you get a free pre-roll something like that i'll link that in the description i don't know exactly i only found this one actually last night when i was on we maps so that's that but um really quickly power plant if you guys are watching this because i reached out to you guys yesterday night saying about the videos and stuff like that and i really quickly want to commend you guys because you guys are doing a great [ __ ] job at this i was reading through some of the weed map reviews and a lot of people were saying oh this is maybe around april um you know when [ __ ] really started hit the fan so to speak with covid people saying oh i placed an order and you know one person on the street was blocked off because of police and they still complained sorry guys and they still complained about their delivery not being um done or whatever so some people gotta get off their high horse and be a little more realistic like when these streets closed off because of the police how can you possibly complain about you know why we didn't get delivered like really dude grow up but no no seriously if you guys are watching um i think so far you guys are doing perfect i mean yeah there was that one issue earlier this year where are you guys shorting me the weed but it wasn't a huge issue i'm not against mistakes are going to be made right we're only human so behind every company you guys got to realize behind every company is a human that does not necessarily make everything that companies do right just saying but behind companies are humans just like you and me so definitely hitting this [ __ ] i'm loving it i'm definitely feeling a little bit more of like i'm going to start using the word sedation i said that in my stream last night um i'm definitely feeling a little bit more of like um mellowed out relaxed kind of sedation so sorry guys let's get the phone call i apologize if you guys said that that vibration on my phone is really really loud but i don't know if you guys even heard it probably not i don't know sometimes i hear [ __ ] that you guys want through the video and i feel like you guys would but you don't so that's good um not that anybody cares but um yeah when it comes to power plant and health man i mean i've i'm very generous and outgoing with it when it comes to shout outs i'm not one of those people like oh you have to give me a shout out if i give you a shout out don't you don't got to be like a six-year-old you know grow the [ __ ] up guys that's not what this is about i mean it does not cost you a damn [ __ ] thing to give somebody a shout out and if it's somebody like power plant that i may not have the biggest [ __ ] uh result in terms of like helping them if let's say they were a small company to give them a shout out i'm a very small youtuber um a little bit of a bigger instagram or whatever whatever i i can call i don't really know if i can say i'm an influencer necessarily but maybe i don't know but that's definitely my goal you know you guys are wondering what my goal is for youtube it's to at least help you guys make the right purchase decision boom dude so definitely expecting it to to make me feel not light-headed but like just very nice not too intense but heavy mental high um this is the thing i find with with weed you either feel a mental relaxation or a physical relaxation and right now i'm feeling a mental relaxation my body's not toning down this is this is when i say body high i mean like you know when you finally get home from a long day at work hard day at work you know and you're just like oh finally you can take your clothes off do whatever you do maybe don't take your clothes off i don't know you know you can just relax you're not at work basically that's what i'm trying to talk about like you feel like finally which you would think i would love to feel like that but then the only downside of indica is i definitely will fall asleep it's just you know i'm not really crazy about that there are some times where i really want you know a lot of times i smoke weed to help me to relax but not i don't i don't buy indicas to the point excuse me to the point where it just like knocks me out i'm not that big within because you guys we know but uh definitely start trying out more of them but this resonation is pretty nice i it sucks you guys won't really see it too well because my camera's lighting is kind of not really the camera in this case it's more my garage but if you guys don't know by the way i do my these videos this is my garage if you guys can tell by that orange thing with the table uh or that light right there or these beams like if you guys can tell i don't know what you guys probably think i live in some [ __ ] hut although in the beginning of the channel you guys are seeing videos being done in my room you guys probably think that's just like the other side of where i'm at right now and like i actually live in like a [ __ ] a wooden hut i was i was struck by my youtube channel the other day and i'm not gonna lie shout out to my mom man she's [ __ ] amazing she's the best i have the best mommy in the world she actually praised me i don't remember i'm not trying to be a dick i don't remember the last time she praised me and i was that happy about how she she felt about something that i did normally if she feels disappointed because i i [ __ ] up something you know i'm saying like i'm not saying i'm a [ __ ] up but i mean i did stupid [ __ ] i'm human um but no no seriousness i assume i'm on my youtube channel she's like wow you did that and this is the other day when i was going and redoing the look of the channel on instagram and all that and i was like yeah i did that you know i did and um the fact that she i thought she was gonna say oh that looks stupid you look stupid talking to yourself in front of the camera not talking to anybody but yourself this is not because i'm not gonna lie at some point every youtuber feels like what am i doing i'm talking to myself there's nobody that i'm talking to until i get a viewer which technically i'm not talking to you but i am so you can take that as you will but um getting back to the joint we're about halfway through and this is hitting heavy i'm not forgetting what i say unless i've forgotten that i forgot what i said already maybe i already did i don't even remember i guess i i i forgot if i forgot no but no seriousness um by the way look at a white that's burning like that clean smoke is good smoke definitely a strain that i would personally recommend halfway through the joint just under 20 minutes into the video um and i'm going to try my very best and i'm not bullshitting this time i promise not going to make this a hour long so but um again definitely something if let's see i don't find blue dream makes me get the munchies i i notice with the uh the strawberry cough i get munchies bad now thankfully i notice some strains when i get the munchies i get it bad but i get it for sweets all the times i get the munchies and i just i'm hungry it doesn't really matter what i'm eating right so you know ladies i hope my mom doesn't see this i it'll be a real flu because she just happens to like you know skip through the video like oh you guys do because nobody [ __ ] watches through the whole damn thing uh i'm this [ __ ] gets to this point like you said that oh my god take that down that's exactly what she is saying duck face but um yeah excuse me every time you coffee get higher that's what people say something about that [Applause] um i haven't paused the video i only paused it once is a phone call i haven't passed it yet due to coffin so that's a good sign um but yeah great strain for during the day you know if you want to wake and bake this is this is my thing i don't personally wake and bake really ever once in a while i will but it'll be after like eight o'clock because i do not want to wake and bake at like five in the morning six in the morning when i usually wake up and usually when you wake up first in the morning you know you take a shower you get dressed do your things do whatever you have to do chores in the morning whatever you know um and i don't i don't want to be like like like high during the first thing in the morning like it's kind of like waking up after you know this is why i don't [ __ ] with edibles when you get when i take edibles i usually get knocked out um not like bill cosby knocked out but like i passed out because i'm tired which um for me that's what edibles do me um but you know i i personally i'm like feeling like that like i don't want to feel just like lazy in the morning you know i'm saying that's already tough enough for me to keep staying awake you know so smoking something like this and if you smoke only half of this like let's see how to put this out right now i it would be fine i'm high enough that i feel it's okay um and this is the thing it's not like this this is again with edibles i kind of feel like the high it takes so long and then it just [ __ ] hits you whereas with a joint it's almost instant it's very within a few like a minute or two a couple minutes but it's gradual as you smoke on the joint which is why i would say halfway through the joint i could put this down and i'm fine but it's not like i'm going to get like absolutely blasted high if i finish the joint which is something that sometimes does happen but usually with blue dream that's never happened so that being said i'm not expecting that to happen with bluedream from powerplant and keep in mind guys they're not paying me to say this i never get paid with these videos i do this i don't care if five years from now i become huge in terms of like like like just so many subscribers and i'm a big influence to youtube within the weed community um and i never make money i would not care about that i genuinely would love to reach out to so many more of you guys so you guys can see what canada's weed is like what toronto's weed is like honestly i don't i haven't been smoking for long it's only been like maybe two three years so all you guys have been smoking since you guys are like pre-teens and [ __ ] since you guys are babies so you know you guys will probably be able to tell we better hey toronto's weed has gotten better like a body of mine in montreal he says bro i miss toronto sweet man it's way better than montreal sweet because although you can get way better like for your money with the amount it's quantity over quality and that is 100 true so when you guys hear me say that oh dude for this price it's a triple man and it's worth the price i'm saying that because for the ounce that i got the quality is there in this case no difference so same with the strawberry cough no difference quality is there i would say honestly man like i said i've been debating whether strawberry cough is my number one stream but this is still number one hands [ __ ] down like this is just one of the best this is actually the best strain i've ever smoked and really consistent across every dispensary i've gone to but personally speaking does power plant health hold the trophy or the the title of the best place where i've gotten blue dream from i would actually have to say yeah mainly and specifically because of how frosty it is if you guys want to see pictures of this of the buds link is down below to that post on instagram um i literally so when you guys ask me how i take the pictures i literally use my iphone 6 plus and a macro lens attachment that i got off of amazon's it's eight or ten different lenses and um obviously the clip to attach it to your phone and that's i think it was like 30 or 40 bucks kind of expensive considering i don't use very many of them it's only like the macro the wide angle the fish eye and there was one other one i don't know what it is other than the bunch that it comes with actually you know what if you guys are interested in buying it it will be linked it will be the bottom the most link in this video's description uh i can't link you guys the phone i mean it works with any phone um i would say as long as you don't have a case that's too thick like if you have an otterbox defender i kind of feel like that would be a little bit too thick giggity but you guys cannot tell exactly how happy i am right now um but that's literally all i do when it comes to taking these pictures i i don't have a dsl i would love to have a professional camera or at least a newer iphone because i i don't [ __ ] with android too much i kind of do but honestly i just i i could stick with iphone i didn't give a [ __ ] you guys call me sheep you guys call me an apple fan but i don't care my money my choice but um heavy so i'm trying to think of other scenarios where you'd really want this kind of like this is a a choice um again definitely if you guys are going to be going like you guys know sometimes i go to the park and i smoke um or i smoke when i'm going for a walk i don't normally do that very frequently i feel like because i'm not a big fan of you know because i don't know on the street who i'm going to run into and if let's say sorry guys but um i completely forgot i was talking about there we go i jinxed myself um throat's getting a little bit raspy and dry but i mean still consistently the taste is there um my lisp hasn't been too noticeable so i mean that's good um i talked about that in one of my previous videos i don't know which one that when i get high sometimes uh i get high to the point where my lisp is just unavoidable it's like tourette's i just [ __ ] it's gonna happen but not not to you know make fun of people that have tourette's i'm just saying um but again getting back to what i saw from the beginning where i said i wanted this to uh sorry i'm expecting this to feel like a fairly nice pleasant head high that's exactly what i'm feeling um that sense of elation and the sense of just euphoria that i'm getting from this that has to be these last three to four strains that i'm getting from power plant health love you guys by the way um that's i'm just feeling that like it's feeling like really really really really good um if you guys suffer from depression this is this is one of those things that i remember when i was first started getting into weed and i was like i wonder what strain to smoke you know i first got a friend and i was you know they were telling me about the ocs and stuff like that and that's how i got into it you know i'm saying and like legally i've talked about the first time smoking weed it was i think episode six the story time series or episode seven or eight or whatever and honestly i'm kind of embarrassed to see if that's the way that i started smoking not that it was anything crazy i didn't like [ __ ] suck a guy's dick for a joint like i went to a friend and he gave me probably some of the shittiest weed and he still smokes probably that same way honestly unless i'm that stupid he just gives me the reggie that falls off the [ __ ] planet you know what i'm saying he just gives me like trim and then somehow gets it to stick together and look like weed you know one thing i was good i was seeing as i was looking at the buds taking the pictures a lot of orange hairs and i've mentioned in the past in a stream a couple nights back that when i see weed with purple or actually let me phrase it like this when i see weed with a lot of orange hairs and brown hairs um i'm going to call them hairs i really don't know what they're called you know i'm saying like those brown golden kind of spots on the weed um i don't look at that as the same way that i would look as we that instead of brown if it was purple you know i'm saying because something about purple strands just hit i don't know what it is i'm not sure there's literally a correlation to that and it's actually because it's purple whatever makes it a purple you know is actually something that increases the terpenes and in the thc counter on the potency so but you know i don't know maybe that's not even the case because it's not like you know you can get angry strain to be purple there are some strands that are darker like that um purple space cookies darker purple but when you shine light on it you can really see that it's purple and it just looks cool and i got pictures of that i got pictures of i believe you i pretty drive pictures of train wreck which is probably one of my very favorite streams visually with the purple it just looks amazing i'm going to try my very best smoke and not make this a 40 minute video i would i don't know some of you guys probably wonder why i have to smoke the whole drawing i just feel like i have to not like someone's putting a gun to my head have to but after in the sense otherwise i'm just kind of like oh wait but um really really nice light smooth smoke um getting back to that that taste i'm just i'm trying to really compare it see if i can i should do a comparison between ocs blue dream from other another company that's not aurora because that's the only company i've gotten my blue dream from in terms of like dried flower um and then compare these two because honestly i'm definitely gonna do that maybe i will go out and buy a gram of blue dream if i can get that little uh because i don't believe the ocs charges for delivery so i mean the price that they show in the ocs this is one thing i like about the ocs that not every place does excuse me i feel everybody should be doing this any company that grows especially or like a walmart or whatever like department stores the price that's shown on screen is including taxes especially because we pay 13 in taxes that's a lot of money you guys may not think it especially if it's a few dollars it's not but when it adds up it adds up taxes nobody likes them some people avoid them like a plague and we get nipped in the ass either way you don't pay your taxes you get nipped you pay your taxes you get ripped off i i was out with my mom uh the other day and this lady we were talking about colvin pandemic and she's she brought the term pandemic so i'm just saying man hashtag pandemic but definitely gonna get the [ __ ] giggles off of this [ __ ] strawberry caught [ __ ] oh my god i smoked this the other day when i was out i could not keep a straight face uh this is definitely gonna be one of those times as well i can i'm probably not gonna be able to keep a straight face i really don't mind getting sometimes i kind of get a little bit sad because it makes me flick into my feelings and think like you know i wouldn't be laughing this much if i wasn't high that's kind of sad but at the same time i'm like i'm not complaining that i'm laughing but i feel like i've got to adjust my mustache on every [ __ ] video like really especially story times like my mustache knows i'm doing a story time it says [ __ ] it we're not going to stay in place today facially disperse you know kind of static electricity but um yeah i definitely want to see if i can grab a gram or something like that i'm kind of curious i don't even know can you get just a gram i'm pretty sure you could but just one gram probably be like maybe 11 bucks not gonna lie probably like 11 58 or 84. that's kind of the stupid thing they have really odd pricing like 1184 why why is such a specific number but this i'm just saying i i don't need to be like that but why such a specific [ __ ] number like why not just make it like [ __ ] 12.99 if you're gonna rip me off like that i mean i'll pay an extra few dollars on top of that price but make it an even [ __ ] number or something like like a real price man or is it 12.99 do me better 13 bucks you don't say like i see these these memes it's like price goes on sale 13 to 12.99 that's not on sale we don't have pennies here in canada so it would have to be like 12.95 to even consider to be a deal at all like of any stretch of the imagination that would be you can never owe somebody four cents or less just keep it like that you can owe somebody five cents but that's about it that's the least they can oh you can know somebody so it's good for all your [ __ ] that don't pay [ __ ] back looking at you matt but big [ __ ] but i'm gonna stop shooting my shots because you know firing range right but um look again i'm just getting back into this red seal look at that dude look at that i don't know why i said like that but look at this just oh my god that restaurant is heavy it's consistent the whole joint that's one thing with the ocs i really don't expect it to rest really that much at all or anything but this from power plant even with their their double a's bro they [ __ ] they do resonate not that much but i mean like for instance when i was looking when i did that tom ford review and it was a quad i was kind of disappointed a lot you guys remember the video if you already watched it i remember i was disappointed because it wasn't super sticky it wasn't me you know like like it didn't resonate that much just to be honest with you for quality that that's that's a lot though let's for me i'm going to be honest with you guys that's a lot down but i mean that's just my opinion you don't have to do what i do say okay go where i go excuse me but um out of 10 this joint i'm not going to lie this is a solid [ __ ] time this this bit of weed that i got from power plant horn which i got again i'm not saying um 10 out of 10. and keep in mind all i'm going to say is they were they're extremely generous with the amount that they gave me i was i was back then smaller obviously but um but i mean my eyes aren't red kind of low but they're not red which is good um something i've been doing in my last few interviews is this a strain that when you're high if i feel somebody else will be able to tell they might be able to catch on when they if they you know notice them giggly because notice you know no no normally normally or if i [ __ ] on my wards um normally when i'm you know sober or not high i like to say not high because sobers runs if alcohol i don't [ __ ] with that [ __ ] but normally when i'm not high i do laugh i mean i come out to submissive well [ __ ] i just gotta put that out there you know and you guys be like i wouldn't be laughing this much if i wasn't high so obviously you're a miserable no i'm i'm a cool guy even when i'm not smoking right at least i like to think so again i can't really make that judgment call but um definitely one of the strains you want if let's say and you don't even need a lot like i don't have to smoke a soul joint you know what i'm saying like i said earlier i could have smoked half of it and i would have been fine so not every strain that i've smoked from power plant has been left out some strains i have to smoke at least a gram or you know at least a testosterone like smoking packing a one or quarter all the way just ain't gonna cut it now personally speaking there are so many different things when it comes to weed that i don't know i'm not trying to make it sound like i know everything about everything i want to get that out there as well um it does also happen to be you know something like for instance i like to smoke this kind of strain because one i like i mentioned earlier i'm not a fan of being locked to the couch or just sleeping all day i just i don't like that there are days where i will want that i'm not going to lie like there's everybody's got those kids those days where they wake up and they just want to stay in bed all day but i don't want that to be a sure thing when i smoke because it really discourages me from smoking like that's when i believe i talk about that in the purple space cookies because even smoking one and a quarters or like half a king size roughly about the same amount of weight um it just it it got me buzzed to the point where really i wasn't a huge fan of it sometimes i would especially if i really want to fall asleep but if it's through that throughout the day i would have to smoke smalls like amounts of it just kind of annoying because i like to take my time when i smoke a joint if the joint is still going to take like 5-10 minutes that i don't like that's why i like smoking blunts that's why and by the way really quickly getting off topic i'm gonna wrap this video up soon um a couple guys were asking why i don't do blunts of story times same reason why i never really do uh one and a quarters um i kind of feel like for one wonder quarters are going to take too long sorry i'm not going to take that long to smoke with blunts i just kind of feel like honestly it's kind of expensive to be getting blunts i don't smoke blunts very often you guys know i don't really i'm not a fan of tobacco but if i gotta be honest with you guys i wouldn't mind smoking a king palm the other the only real reason why i don't [ __ ] with king palms and story times is because it's on certain strain reviews is because that's quite a bit of weed like that's at least a gram and a half that personally like i said a lot of times if i smoke too much weed i just feel really sedated and really relaxed to the point where i don't want to do much and i don't like feeling like that so for all of you guys who are wondering why i don't smoke ping pongs in my stream reviews that is why why you stick to king-sized joints i think in a few uh strain reviews i've done i smoked one and a quarter i know i've smoked two joints in story times sorry guys but by the way look at how smoky this [ __ ] croc is getting look at all that smoke up there but um my joint is over here it's not up to the cabin by the way i don't have it like this to make it seem like oh my god look at how smoky this room is not i don't think so but um to kind of wrap this video up would i recommend this from powerplant health [ __ ] it 10 out of 10 for you guys um i would say you guys have probably the best [ __ ] prices i i did a post showing you guys i'm not saying this like for cloud whatever i'm saying this for the viewers that are watching this strictly as a strain review and if you're not powerful enough um it's it's it's one of those things that personally i talked about them because they have the best [ __ ] prizes i've ever seen now the one reason why i stick with them and i don't go to someone else because i really could go one i i trust power plant i do not trust having my id like i won't [ __ ] with any of you guys i get you guys reaching out to me like hey you want to buy some of my weed you want to try i'll give you a reduced price and i'll say yeah okay what's the deal oh just send me a picture of your id no i'm sorry that's not gonna [ __ ] happen i'm not stupid um or i've had a couple of you guys reach out and be like hey you know you're just gonna pay for this shipping or pay for this and i know how this kind of stuff works if it's strictly through instagram you know what i'm saying like like cash up or eat um or um venmo or paypal i don't do that [ __ ] if i can't e-transfer you the money because i want to do things the way that i'm comfortable with you know or what's that mean money how the [ __ ] are you gonna do that dude send me the money via whatsapp i'm not too familiar with those kind of things i'm going to sound like a boomer when i say this but i'm sticking with what i know so we're almost on this joint i'm trying to make this no more than 45 minutes so yeah i mean firstly guys the fact that they don't ask for id i think person is good i mean one thing that they could do if they really want to be like that because i understand why asking for id is such a big deal and it's because you don't want people underage especially children buying weed you shouldn't be doing anything stupid like that especially at 12. okay this is why i smart i started smoking i drank started drinking before i started smoking weed because i weighed at 19 my friends bought me a bottle of gray goose we [ __ ] down that [ __ ] um i might even do a birthday story time i don't know if you guys want to hear those stories on my birthday when i turn 19. i got a couple funny stories and then when i turned 22 21 however that was it's been a couple years like i said um i started smoking weed i have not been smoking weed since i was a kid like a whole bunch of you guys i think it's crazy that i know my cousin's friend started smoking weed i think he was like 12. i'm like bro that's crazy this is back when i was still believing about the you know taboo but we that we use a drug and drugs or pad you know which wheat is a drug you know what i'm saying i'm not saying it isn't because all you guys will say oh but i don't really consider weed a drug that's what you don't consider that doesn't mean it's not a drug so that being said this is why i've mentioned in the past i'm not the kind of person to go and say if a body of mine is like oh i got back pain smoke a joint you have to smoke a joint dude just smoke the joint try it at least try to take a puff tell me i'm not pushy about anything if my friend doesn't want to try it they do not have to try it simple as that and i'm saying this because i've seen some people really not be pushy but they're persistent not necessarily pushy very fine difference very fine line they are persistent with the way that you're trying to encourage it that's what i'm gonna say some of y'all guys will say oh i'm just rewarding the way that you describe pushy but teach their own so wrapping this joint up because we're done because if not my my throat's going to turn into ash um absolutely 10 out of 10 of the taste the smell the presentation i mean it's fairly straightforward basic presentation it comes in a bag but it's not as like a shitty ziploc bag i've genuinely seen places little sponsor that very first spencer that i went to that was down the street the one that i never want to name because they are garbage people um oh it's the owner was the the blood tenders are okay they were nice um what does that say it comes in those like like ziploc bag things it looks it's it's a ziploc like it looks like a ziploc and i'd say well like this much um i'm not sure what they would give you if you ordered more than [ __ ] six grams because that's i would never spend more than 60 bucks there never i don't care if i'm getting 12 strain i'm buying only four grams or [ __ ] or whatever the [ __ ] you know i i'm not spending more than 60 bucks there never did then unfortunately i never get the chance to or not even fortunately but unfortunately for them so to wrap this up um like i said out of 10 quality definitely there definitely a strain that again i'm going to say this again if you guys are the type of people that like myself do not want to smoke to them fall asleep the whole day um this is definitely a strain for you it's definitely something that will give you a huge very big sense of euphoria so again if let's say maybe you're down in the pits because then again i did a mental health awareness post the other day about a week a week and a half ago roughly um i don't know or it'll if i can figure out how to work the the eye in the top right i'm still learning with youtube it's been what [ __ ] seven years i've been on this and i still don't know everything so that being said um to wrap this up what i recommend this absolutely 150 million percent yes um and for all the guys who are going to look at weed maps uh reviews of power plant health and be like oh there's eight one star reviews that's the first place i want whenever looked on weed maps i have ordered from them at least half a dozen times never once i remember the first night that i ordered from them i think i mentioned this when i did my review on their service way when i first started youtube about five six months ago and personally speaking i was nervous as hell because i was like you know what even though i don't have to get my id um i was worried like i'd eve transferred them to money what if they [ __ ] off my money like genuinely i kind of feel like it's normal to worry about that kind of stuff you don't know the company at all you have no kind of like um what's the word i'm looking for no no reputation of your own built with that company first time so you're normally going to be a little bit sketchy a little bit you know kind of on the edge be like oh what if they [ __ ] off my money because at the time it was a hundred dollars that i invest i invested into a company that i had no idea about i mean i look at reviews so even though a lot of people say yo um you know this this we i ordered this and whatever and i ordered that and it was perfect came on time came nicely packaged i mean when i did the review of their service i'm pretty sure i talked about or i talked to them in a video i don't almost 100 sure that when they deliver the weed it's discreet for instance you can tell them to leave it i don't know if you're really suspect about people seeing it you know throw it in a bush that's in front of my door i'm sure they'll do that you know like not carelessly but in a way that it'll be something you can find you know he's not trying to be hide and seek with yourself right but um anyways i said this is not gonna be more than 45 minutes i've already gone five minutes over that so thank you guys for watching this video if you watch this the whole way through thank you very much and if you guys did not watch this video the whole way through but you just happen to stumble upon this point probably because it's the end of the video um thank you i

the strawberry cream comment below let's get it", "0A2ie09Q9RA": "hey guys welcome to the secret history living inside your aquarium I'm Alexander Williamson and I will be guiding you through this little chart so first of all I wanted to say that this chart has come from petrol source that I've tracked down somewhat breeder distributor and hobbyists so there have been a lot of charts floating around out there I had another chart it wasn't quite as clear the direction in which we have selectively bred shrimp and this is stemming everything from you know blue velvet shrimp Sakura yellow Sakura shrimp green jade shrimp blue really black rose carbon bloody marys chocolate choclo orange red really painted fire Bloody Mary you name it so all those neo caridina shrimp that you know and love are in this chart and the chart has been changing so I posted a video a few months back and that chart was a little bit confusing in that it had arrows kind of coming and going and kind of maybes and ifs this one is laid out a little more clear there's still a bit of I guess questionable lineage going on but geneticists and hobbyists are trying to figure out what's what exactly is what because this selective breeding process is actually relatively new in the cherry shrimp or neo caridina shrimp project so to speak as humans have undertaken so throughout the history of this we only have a short time since the mid-90s that people were intensively selectively breeding these for the hobby so in the wild you have basically pal Mata and David I that have come to be part of what we usually see in pet stores and online in forums and things as neo caridina shrimp now cherry shrimp were the first to hit the market later followed by really shrimp and blue shrimp and so this chart kind of shows that transition but there are several wild types so there's the rusty red wild type then there's the wild Shoko which is like a darker coloration type and then there's also a lighter orange like yellowish wild type that you find in the wild and then there are also the PAL Mata variations which give you all your pearls blue pearls white pearls and then there are also hybrids of those mixed in with any given other Davey dye selection of shrimp so let me go through this a little bit in 1997 in Taiwan breeders were starting to play with this line here they got shrimp down into Sakura rhetta's hobbyists 1999 was the first time that really all of Asia Japan started really getting serious about breeding these before people had neo caridina shrimp basically in their aquariums and things as a filter cleaner shrimp kind of thing and kind of The Naturalist look inside of nature style tanks but they weren't bred for the bright colors intentionally anyhow although many hobbyists did see that you could select for certain traits like stripes or solid patches or clear patches and from there it really exploded and because they reproduce so quickly you know they can get pregnant every 30 to 45 days in theory and even though that's not generally how it works for each female but and then they can have you know anywhere from 15 to 30 babies easily and then those grow up within it maybe three months there at reproduction age so in a given year you can one hobbyist if they have enough tanks can actually get pretty far in this as shown by how far the variants have come in the last since well since last 20 years really is what we're talking about 1998 being even earlier so that they hit the scene in 2002 November they were brought into the country and from their 2003 red cherry shrimp were available they weren't really graded in a coherent system until a little later on but now we have all these other variants so let's go through some of these variants if you're just getting into shrimp this chart should help you if you're a hardcore breeder you may have information that I do not have and keep in mind that a lot of people sourced their shrimp and they may have a Bloody Mary that's a low caliber assuming it's a red and then it throws a chocolate which throws a blue two generations later and then reverts back to a chocolate looking one and so while you're seeing these arrows pointing in one direction they also work the other way so anywhere down this line it can revert back to these wild source types and they're not different species but they're different phenotypes fino meaning how it looks on the outside and genotype being what it's made of genetically in its DNA and those two things could differ pretty wildly you can have a red shrimp that is from this lineage or you could have a red shrimp that is from this one so the information is a little confusing because some people may have thought that they had you know cherry shrimp and it turns out that they had Bloody Marys and then they're using that information to say that they bred blue Velvets or something along those lines so and as you can see here they all have the same genetics as a species this part of the chart these are separate slightly from a common ancestor but there's a path here to blue velvet which kind of is blue dream or blue velvet depending on who you ask kind of the pinnacle of the blue series topaz also being another name and also some people argue that there are blew pearls crossed with blue dreams which make a blue topaz I don't know the truth on that and I haven't gotten it sorted out but hopefully genetics will get this sorted out soon and let's talk about it from this big old mess that I've just said is impossible to sort out for sure and talk about what we do know so this chart here start with the wilds that are rusty selectively breed them redder and redder until you see that their legs are growing actual red on them and then their shells other exoskeletons are becoming less and less see-through so they're becoming opaque as we say and at a certain point painted red fire red you've got this bright bright red but a deep red and you can't even see through to see a saddle or eggs being carried and that's kind of the highest grade within that it splits off into two more based on body style and a few other details but we won't go into here with ease and s's being grade systems within the pinnacles of each of these shrimp you see on the list so basically we do know that the wild cherry shrimp or the wild neo caridina debut dye that we have turned into cherry shrimp it got redder and redder and at any point in time here it's also thrown red really shrimp and that is a shrimp with the clear spot since normally they have little stripes of clear they through these and so that was another early shrimp that came out onto the scene and people selectively bred for more and more of that clear spot less and less of red until it was divided into two so from there that clear spot began to show signs of blue as that red gets deeper the pigment actually has blue in it too to make the red appear as more of a royal red or a blood red it has a little bit of blue mixed in with the color in the pigmentation so from there people got rid of the red and created blue jellies now some people will argue that blue jellies also have a lineage in pal Mata I don't know the answer to that but I do know that this path is one that is possible and so from the painted fire Reds we also have such dark Reds that they start to look black but that occurs more in my experience with the blue shrimp so when you have a blue dream shrimp or a blue diamond they're coming from a brown chocolate shrimp and some people will say the Shoko or wild choco is chocolate shrimp but they're they're selectively bred so they're either a dark brown bronze or a dark dark chocolate color or a light chocolate color and then from there you go down and they start showing blue and then they start showing more and more blue as the red is weeded out from back here wild-type wise and as they're selectively bred you end up down here with blue velvet on the far end and blue dream being the apex of this lineage strip here and you lose the yellow and you gain the red from the game the blue from the brown coloration that is in their pigmentation from there at any point really this chart is a bit deceiving you can also get really shrimp splitting off so the realese can happen anywhere and a lot of times they look weakly colored like the pigment on the other ends of the shrimp will be weakly colored but you'll get that Center strip with either clear as a carbon really is or as blue as the blue carbon really czar and I think I love both of those but they're a bit interchangeable and often times your blue shrimp if they're not a super pure line can throw kind of odd really combinations or Riley combinations from now let's talk quickly about the difference between a painted fire which is the dark royal red and Bloody Mary which actually has some flesh underneath the exoskeleton that's red and just a deeper more of a lobster like a cooked lobster red or something that not that bright cooked but the the dark red that you can see in some lobsters in the wild lobsters also happen to throw blue as do crayfish and that's because to get that deep brown it needs color combinations under its skin of yellow green blue and red and so that blue is kind of a variant similar to almost albino ISM a little different than that but similar if you want to play along so Bloody Mary's are basically the brown type that once in a while will throw the chocolates that have more of a red tint which is kind of close to the wild of these but with less translucent spots and then from there you got a striped wild shrimp and that turned into what we know is the Bloody Mary now people have crossed Bloody Marys and painted fires and muddled that all up and that's why it's tricky because when you see a lineage that ends here essentially this is the apex of the coloration being all the other colors removed you don't have the blue in there underneath the red necessarily it's just red you end up with a lot more of an intense color and so when you cross that back with something that could have blue somewhere in the line because this is not always a progression so I've been asked several times you know well if it works this way how come my blue really had a you know sakura red style shrimp baby well those genes are hidden in in there in their history in their bodies and so it can revert anywhere along with scale although most likely when you cross color types that have been kind of purified into colors that we recognize such as yellow green red blue black or white snowball or white pearl - then you end up getting a wild type and that I think that's just almost like the genes express themselves in a way that it reverts back to what's easiest when it can't figure out what's nothing it is a thinking system of genes but when there's not a completely clear dominance the genes revert so from those cherry shrimp also you get a lighter color shrimp that turned into orange realese or Riley's just like the red so you get an orange and red from that rusty color that clear spot then turns blue on this side whereas it turns more yellow on this side and starts to throw more of like a greenish yellow or a golden color and I can show you that at the very end of the video here which we're getting to but I just wanted to explain how this kind of works and then heat from here Orange throw green which is unexpected right you wouldn't think that necessarily but orange shrimp can throw green and they can also revert back to cherry or wild rusty color or wild yellow color so it's kind of an interesting little tidbit that they can do that Sakura yellow being the most intense yellow of these and kind of where that line ends there's also stripes down the back and things like that other variations that people have added to the line but that's the end of the line essentially and then from here you could also throw you can skip this step around and you can actually get from here to the green or green jade and greens are very notorious for throwing brown or yellow or you know they're not the most stable line now people are starting to get green Jade's that are more and more stable but it doesn't work like mixing paints you can't just mix red and yellow and get orange you know that's clearly not how this works down here the darkest shrimp it's assumed I've also seen that there are wild shrimps that are dark enough that they were just selectively bred straight away instead of chocolates into the Black Rose style shrimp but under this chart they're coming from either painted fire or blue dream and then they are essentially one of several variants you get either the clear or the blue in the center just as you see here with that progression of the blue jellies now blue jellies often look like weak blue dreams or blue Velvets which throw off color blue as well but I just wanted to kind of show you the breakdown of how it goes and just know that if you put a bunch of shrimp and a tank together that are a different neo caridina colors they will not mix the way you think logically as the the rest of the world works in as far as color theory goes so now let's take you real quick over to the actual shrimp pardon the shaky camera maybe we'll cover it so that y'all don't have to get dizzy but so down here we have some shrimp and I've set aside a couple for you guys to look at and so essentially these are wild types in here you can see here that this one could be considered part Shoko with that chocolate color and then in here we have red Riklis also of a low lower grade but you can see that blue being thrown and these all came from these red cherry shrimp this this brood here happened to be throws from these Reds that I've been working with for some time now you can see that some of the young ones are going to be once I select them out and grade them they're going to be lower grade because they're striped but none of these are Bloody Marys they're just very intensely colored painted fire or fire shrimp so up here let's find some more examples here we have a yellow you can see some of the yellow in there their guts up in their head essentially but you can see the black striping rather than rather than the brown striping and so that can be selected for overtime with more of those so that you're getting black and you can make a carbon shrimp also so it's a little confusing obviously here you can see one that has kind of a green brown color and so that is something along the lines of a native wild shrimp also you know from there you can select and sometimes you'll end up with something back in the cherry room right here's a prime example of the more yellowish shrimp even though that's its guts that have color and somewhat of the ovaries of the shrimp there is an actual golden Sheen to that head and stuff when you look at it closely back up in here we've got let's see if we can see from above a little clearer you can see that blue really well in this female adult red really and whereas some of the young ones that she has birthed and these guys are set aside because they're going to a pet store as low grades but some of them have very nice clear markings in between the red rather than blueish ones like this one here selectively you could take two of those and select for less and less color so it's clear and so on and so forth so that's kind of what's going on in this little mini breeder box over here we have cherry shrimp that didn't make the cut so to speak and are also going to the pet store as just plain old sherry shrimp this is probably as close like this one here as in the wild you would see to a cherry shrimp which sparks the idea of having cherry shrimp but they can easily be selected if you take the brightest of them and you can select for these now here's another interesting one which is it is technically a Blue Dream from Lucas Bret's line that I acquired and some of the babies in this brood they're all from one blue dream female all the blue babies that are in this tank and I pull the babies as soon as they start to get about yay big but they have actually because of the darker substrate here they've darkened up so that is part of their epigenetic code and that is the part of their genes that get expressed that can show later in life almost like when you go through puberty these these shrimp can change according to their environment through different hormone responses they can lighten up or darken up and so here you see more of the classic blue very young these ones are two weeks old or so sorry about the focus and you have some really good quality blues in here and then you also have some that are so dark that they're probably black and then you can see that you've got more of a wild type revert from the red colony that's an older group so up here let's take a look real quick and see if we can find any of the adult blues that I keep separate they tend to hide in the day in this tank but in any case I just wanted to try to find you one and I don't think I will be successful at this point in time so that is the the essential breakdown of the chart with the information we have today it is subject to change and if you know something different about the chart and you have selectively bred and figured out that something is a revert of something and then cross back for instance feel free to let me know I keep my adult shrimp in separate tanks by color and then I let the females hatch in this tank which has no fish it's just shrimp and snails and then in this tank once they're about half inch or maybe a third of an inch I'll throw them in this tank so I hope this helps some of you newer understand a little bit the basics of it I don't want to say that this is gospel because the issue is changing and it was also a very proprietary thing that that the shrimp were bred by different distributors and companies for different traits and so sometimes it was not divulged where they came from and that lineage was protected so just remember that if you learn something here if you like this video please give it a thumbs up think about subscribing or maybe just checking out some of my older videos and have a great day take care of your critters feel free to message me with any questions comments or changes to this I'll probably be coming out with another video as currently genetic testing is underway to figure out what's what about this snails are great in your shrimp tank by the way they eat the extra food that the shrimp don't get to this one would be a grade below painted fire she's got all red but you can still see through her in the light so I'll be getting rid of these other shrimp today they have the size too close to an adult that I don't want them to mix and ruin my line so this isn't the professional way to do it you'd want to keep every color and strain separate but I am not necessarily a professional obviously shrimp breeder I'm a hobbyist and I like to mix it up a little bit and see what I get and I don't have a million tanks I have five tanks to work with for practically so I have a blue tank a red tank a yellow tank and a wild-type tank that mixes however random hodgepodge mixes end up so these will not intermix also with caridina if everybody's wondering the PAL Mata they can and there are also some other new variants of neo caridina that people are arguing whether or not they are actual different species like the the rusty red Wilde's versus the yeah the darker Wilde's is that a whole new species I don't know we'll find out sometime so I hope you guys have a great day take here and keep on swimming talk to you next time

on my name is Steve Stevenson this is Maryland marijuana review where I bring you my humble opinion on the things that I buy I buy a lot of things you know what I'm saying some good some bad some in between but I promise you I give them all a fair shot because um yeah you know I mean there are a lot of buds out there and I just want to try them all gotta catch them all toki mom so let's go with the first bud of the day here I'm going to do one that's um this is called blue dream let's start on blue dream quick readout on blue dream I'm having some technical difficulties so I'm gonna keep checking the camera to make sure it's not giving me any sass back so blue dream blue dream is a protein cross between the ever popular classic strains blueberry and Hayes crossed with blue dream or Azure haze depending on who you ask and this is coming from Wicky leave huh so that's about where we're at on that I don't know about all that but um yeah anybody that's followed my uh my videos or whatever I did a review on this a few maybe like right before Christmas time I got some CBD blue dream and um I was very impressed I was very took in the back if I had to give a simple comparison between the two I would say there for the most part the same plant though this CBD strain had a little bit more a little something extra in the scent that I wouldn't say was desirable and I would not say that it is on we'll leave it at that so blue dream let's do this let's post a picture yeah let's get a picture up and then I'm gonna do this let's get on the review so as a part of my a-game I'm trying to up the quality and give more information on the roundabouts of the things I buy so instead of holding the butt up which I can still hold the butt up I don't know if it'll do you any justice but this golf ball-sized nug I got from nature's medicines on route 40 and oh yeah I like the non prepackaged flower you know it's reminiscent of the old school I mean sometimes if you get an ounce they might even put it in a bag it's the decorative bag though it looks like it's not that bad yeah let me see if I can get a little housecleaning so our first video for 2019 how was y'all's New Year's did y'all do anything exciting entertaining hopefully um I'd say put it down in the comments section but I don't want any of you all to be uh breaking any laws or putting anything if you did anything unlawful respect yeah so that being stated um yeah I hope you all had a good one all things considered this blue dream the smell in it hmm you know it has a tropical yet fruity kind of essence it's something that uh it sparks my interest on many different levels be it from the taste of it to the smell of it to just all-around it's um yeah it's really really unbelievable and like I say this uh this does break down it stays pretty pretty well together but I'd imagine if you were to crush it and you know grind it up good you could definitely do it well with your fingers but if you were to just give it a nice slight break up you could do it without a grinder and you could definitely roll a decent joint with this I haven't gotten that far yet I'm more or less use it as a seasonal flavoring for my not so flavorful weeds because our review buds always do I don't always look the greatest to [ __ ] sometimes I just look [ __ ] because it's a hundred and eighty an ounce or cheaper yeah well let's give this Blue Dream a day in court hmm lighters ooh okay oh yeah wow that is really good it's so tropical it really does have like a tropical flavor to it that's the best way I could put it I don't know if a blue dream is a tropical drink but I would imagine it would be yeah something pretty pretty flavorful something with pineapple in it I'm not saying this weed tastes like pineapple and I'm not saying this sweet is gonna give you heartburn like some sort of weird pineapple drink but um yeah it's not bad at all like I say if um it's too early to give it a signing factor as to what my favorite buds are for 2019 but I'm honestly gonna say this blue dream is up there in contender and I'll take it at that it is a good but a solid but all around it gets the Steve Stevenson mark of approval some ash and it also gets a odd high-five to the grower so I will try to find out who grew this I will try to put as much gathered information as I can into the comments section or the the drop down description so I'll try to be as you know informative as possible that's one of my new year's resolutions do a better job at the videos I make yeah y'all we're gonna take the time to watch I'm gonna take the time to bingi bring you the best product that I physically can yeah well folks it's been a pleasure um my new camera my new sound equipment my new I guess that's it for now I got a new cell phone too but we're not talking about that so anyways folks y'all have a good one Steve Stevenson over and out thank you folks always a pleasure indeed", "7MWC1JbP12E": "hey guys so I got another review here I got this fresh cartridge it's a 1 gram it was on sale for 30 bucks so it seemed like a good deal on paper 96 percent supposedly tested THC nothing really fancy going on here it looks like a new company you know it's not a super corporate looking so I decided to give him a try see see if they're legit or not it's blue dreams Teva you know it's the beginning of the day so it's definitely stat Eva time so go ahead and give it a try got a couple different batteries here cuz sometimes cards don't like to work on the push-button ones or inhale time so we'll see what this is about it looks pretty nice golden color it's a full gram see that faint looks pretty pretty thick it looks like a thick liquid that's a good sign let's see my try it on this regular pure vapor pull type battery it doesn't have a button I'm gonna see if it works on this first it's lighting up but I'm not getting anything out of it let's try one of these and it was good okay so I turned this all the way up the red push-button one and it does seem to work I guess these regular 3.5 hole types was they were it just wasn't strong enough or something maybe it'll start working you know once the fluid starts going through here but these amsterdam batteries just the regular push-button kind of generic type seem to work a lot better so let me see here it's got a real weedy taste to it you know it's not sweet no beating around the bush with this one it definitely tastes weedy it doesn't taste super high quality but it doesn't taste like there's any chemicals or anything in there which is a good sign [Music] it just really tasted the garbed weed I can really taste you know the D card process you know it tastes kind of like burnt weed I'm gonna try and turn this lower see ya it tastes a little better yeah I guess the medium settings where it's supposed to be but yeah there's no frills no you know through fruit flavor and this or anything just straight-up blue dream you know I'm hoping this blue dream you know I'm hoping it's not just some generic sativa they're calling blue dream and just putting you know trying to put blue dream terpenes in there or something yeah they don't taste like you know man-made terpenes it tastes like legit like this is the actual flavor of it so I'm gonna smoke on this for a little bit my tolerance isn't exactly what it used to be so I'll probably take about you know five or six hits on this really quick and I'm gonna come back and let you guys know what's up all right all right so I'm just finishing up my stash here with this I took maybe about seven hits or so and I gotta say I'm already feeling it feels really good it's definitely a sativa you know it's a it's a strong sativa you do get that like racy and feely and you know just sitting here so you definitely want to be out and do like doing something I'm gonna get up here and you know get to work but uh yeah it feels really really strong I'm actually pretty impressed I was expecting you know this would be a total lie obvious like honestly and I'm actually pretty high it feels really good it's leaps and bounds better than the h1 was and it's even cheaper so you know definitely get something like this over h1 I'm super high right now definitely give this a thumbs up I would definitely get more if you can find these for $30 go for it for sure I would even pay 45 for this I'm definitely gonna order more at 30 bucks pleasantly surprised fresh good brand definitely a thumbs up I would say it's even better than the pure vape ones as you can see this is really nice and thick again it doesn't really like to work on these whole type batteries the variable you know wattage push-button ones seems to work pretty good on so you know keep that in mind yeah thumbs up thumbs up on this go ahead go ahead and buy them you won't be disappointed definitely worth it try and look for this brand", "QoPN6GHsfsE": "[Music] do me a favor subscribe to my

caridina shrimp and red cherry Nia caridina shrimp I set this tank up about two weeks ago if you want to check out the setup video click the link above as an experiment I added three blue velvet shrimp to my red cherry shrimp colony the blue Velvets and the red cherries enter bred and created some interesting offspring most of them are a clear grayish color but some of the shrimp are a light red or light blue color after a few months I separated the blue Velvets and their offspring from my cherry shrimp colony I moved them into this tank to continue the experiment in this tank I have the three blue velvet shrimp and all of the offspring that they created I'm going to let them continue to breed and reproduce to see what kind of variations we get you may have noticed I recently purchased three new red cherry shrimp and have placed them in this tank for quarantine typically a quarantine tank should have no other shrimp in it to prevent the spread of disease and parasites the shop I purchased these from is the same shop I bought my original cherries from so I'm not worried about any disease or parasites just to be safe I added them to this tank instead of my red cherry colony I have upstairs I will continue to monitor them and if everything looks good they'll be joining the other cherry shrimp in a few weeks if you haven't done so already do me a huge favor and hit

"hey there welcome to the secret history living inside your aquarium and my aquarium as well this is Alexander Williamson and I am showing you a shrimp giving birth now this happens to be a neo caridina de vida shrimp also known as the Blue Dream shrimp and you're immensely lucky to catch this point of view if you can ever because this female shrimp loop there goes one baby I don't know if you caught that because she is buried up if you can see those berries a little clearer when i zoom out and she's at the perfect angle for us to see she is behind a piece of glass which is warping things a little bit but her side flank armor on that you're looking through the translucent blue there goes another little one is completely right now it's completely clear she isn't a dark blue color she's been on a lighter substrate lately or at least medium colored substrate so kind of interesting but you're watching her actively give birth to the last of her eggs and you can see she's still jostling them for oxygen and things but it almost looks like she is having a slightly tough time now there is a nother you can see a baby shrimp in there with her that is one this one walking here to the left of her that is one from probably a week ago so you can see the size difference we're talking about here between the eggs and the mother shrimp now it's it appears that she probably has maybe 20 to 30 eggs and right now she's probably get oh there goes another one I don't know if you can catch these if you're seeing them like I am as well but basically it just looks like a little floaty thing going off into the water and she's helping them undo there they're the egg casing and basically letting them out and they they either float away lightly or they still have the remainder of their shell of sorts and that shell then floats down to the bottom in between the substrate here and you know that's where they wherever they land is where they end up and then they'll lay low in the substrate for sometimes up to a week and they'll live off of some of what was inside of them and in the eggs and then they'll go searching for food all the meanwhile kind of searching for our folks and bacteria and fungi that help them help them I guess eat in the in the meanwhile as they're still in this sort a semi larval stage although neo caridina shrimps are considered a higher-order shrimp meaning they give live birth now if you have these shrimp or you're curious about them they are the exact same shrimp species wise as the cherry shrimp and they are a selective breed or or morph visual difference of the as I said neo caridina David eye as well as it's possible that parliament palma pal mata or Zhang and menses I believe it is pronounced also have some bloodlines shared in the hobby amongst some breeders although the Neo Karenina de vida is what is commonly accepted and assumed to be the majority of the blood in these blue dream shrimp now these come from the darker morph of the natural type of shrimp and they come from a chocolate shrimp which then starts putting off a blue morph but also interestingly enough neo caridina blue shrimp are probably the most common route that can be morphed to now I know that that statement sounds confusing but essentially what I'm saying is that and now you can see see she's tossing a couple eggs around which is getting the mold off of them you can see towards the back there she has a little pearl or ball that she's working right now she's just pushed it up forward again and it has it was circular now it is no longer circular and it is looking more like a baby curled up shrimp than a perfectly round ball and so she's helping undo that and it's really quite magical to watch them do this and they they can feel clearly they're not looking at it they can feel which little shrimp need help they're not just dropping these eggs to fend on their own necessarily now they do accidentally drop them from time to time and I've seen that happen also especially when they're really full or or stressed or startled really full of eggs that is but this is a proper birth happening where she was full earlier today and there should still be another female who is full to the brim but oftentimes you'll also find that groups of shrimp give birth together and also get pregnant or buried together but yeah she she's using those back Schwimmer ATS those legs on her side that are next to the armor plating on on her which is purely defensive obviously she's using those one to aerate the eggs and move them around so they don't develop any mold and then two to keep them safe and with her and three to kind of polish off the edges so to speak and and work on opening them as they're naturally hatching also and then to sort out which ones are still in there and need a little bit of help versus which ones are good to go so I'm going to try to clear away some of the over the the what do we want to call it here the the water the stuff on top of the water and oh just so happens that one of the other pregnant is making an appearance very pregnant female Bluebird Balti also right you can see her eggs are slightly different color so we've got this cool shot kind of well focus for you guys but we've got the big female all very pregnant here with the one who is just getting rid of the last few eggs as we're watching this now this process can take a matter of probably a half hour or it can take days I've seen some pregnancies last or be split up into like a week that's not as common but it does happen where they had some eggs that were probably more ready more developed and they let them go earlier so right now what she's doing is she's got to work those eggs out and it's interesting to notice in this female she's very healthy and you can tell that even though with her color you might assume is she missing some sort of nutrients or something she's very translucent part of that is the stress at night also shrimp if you turn their light the light off a lot of times they look less vivid than in the day and they have the ability either consciously or unconsciously as a reaction to change the the color in their flesh and some of them on their exoskeleton it'll have like be actually a color as well making it look even more intense when their flesh is that color on top of that now if you happen to find a passed away or deceased blue shrimp oftentimes at first they'll be a pale blue but then they'll sometimes be a pink to clear color so that's just kind of an interesting side note but as we're watching her she's got the other female now with her so this is kind of fascinating I don't know what what is going on here they're right behind the brim of this this glass which is frustrating because I would rather try to film for you guys and maybe you know what I'm going to this is just too interesting of a spectacle also another pregnant female that wants to come by and say hey she just gave birth yesterday is one of the Balti shrimp just swam by and again while we're waiting for the last of the pregnancy to clear out you can see on the walls some of the blue dream shrimp that came out last week and they already have a nice deep blue to kind of a clearish gray color which is not the same in every strain so blue dreams as I was saying before I kind of got excited myself also have the most number of routes genetically to get to their their coloration so blue dreams have been created they can happen in the wild a mutation that causes a blue shrimp not nearly as blue as these usually but just like lobsters and crabs in shellfish for some reason or another that is one of the prominent occurrences of colors that can happen okay here we go we're gonna try to move this a little and now hopefully we'll have a less obstructed view so they can either mutate from a wild state which is usually like a clear color or a striped red as the natural cherry shrimps and that's a talking very pale stripe like there is probably a a baby over here that I could show you that would look something more like a wild a wild shrimp with the red tendencies not even these are our pale enough but something along the lines of you see that little greenish one there the wild ones have that clear color and like back in here here's one they have a clearish color and some of them are brown some of them are black and others are darker brown but they all are some variation of that now from those four main phenotypes that we distinguish they usually are talking about blue dream shrimp are coming from the Shoko line whereas blue velvet shrimp come from another line possibly now this is all a little contentious in the different breeders say different things a lot of it was very proprietary when these were new and people were paying you know $100 a shrimp search for blue shrimp when they were new to the world but essentially you had some random just one-in-a-million occurrences and when people started keeping cherry shrimp cherry red shrimp like we were just looking at some of those once in a while you'd get a blue one and they'd select those and they'd bring them over and over and now we have these world-class quality like this one here which is this one is from Lucas Bratz so these are considered the truest blue Blue Dreams in the world they are supposedly and seemed to be to me as well have the most consistent blue they don't need much calling as in you see how blue this female is here she is just a beautiful regal blue and her organs inside of her are the only thing that really separates how how much blue there is whereas this is the lightest end of the scale but I must say too that as we're watching the end of this pregnancy so something spooked her there probably a Hydra or some sort of small little creature in in the in the substrate there you see that one behind over there to the left just jumped there could be some little little critter in there that's that's stinging them or you know startling them but the colors can come from the darker chocolate color shrimp and that brown is actually made up of a mixture of red and blue as well as some yellow pigments and black all together and a brown or tan and then also the dark red believe it or not the Bloody Marys within their line and it's debatable whether they had blue crossed into Radigan or whether the red just happened to cross out of the blue but a lot of the deeper reds and I'm gonna pull away here in just a moment when I make sure that she's not about to vote see she just kicked that egg back to the very back of her body there and she might be kicking it out I think we're gonna see it here I'm sorry it's grainy that she just dropped one into the substrate so that'll be a baby that she's just let's be but basically yes so she is almost done it looks like maybe there's one two three eggs left up in there in her midsection right by that dark spot in in her abdomen and her color is starting to return to now that color is lighter for several reasons one being stressed two being the time of day three being nutrients and four being that she is you know she's giving birth so right here you can see the other pregnant female who is pregnant and hers probably some of her color has left her body because she's giving that nutrients to her young she's giving that extra you know calcium or carotene I you know to be quite honest I don't know what elements go into pigmentation of the the blue pigmentation specifically but you can see the other female not quite as far along the eggs are smaller a little different color they're kind of a mustard color and I've seen these eggs be everything from a reddish brick hue to mustard - almost whitish to neon yellow and green with fuzzy green indicating a fungal bacteria where you will lose the eggs but yeah so the the blue line comes from there it also comes from pearl blue pearl Motta's and over here if we pull away for a minute let's see if any of the real dark cherry shrimp are around but here's a normal cherry shrimp nice and bright red you know typical vibrant there you go really red like just blazing red but if we take a look at let's get some other ones flushed out of here like this gal here she actually has blue pigment that allows her to look like a darker red but it's really blue pigment it doesn't turn into purple like mixing paints these darker ones are closer to a Bloody Mary which just means that the actual pigmentation within their flesh and in their skeleton in their exoskeleton actually has hues of blue in it so this process can go on all night so I won't bore you with it but I just wanted to kind of show you the actual process and it's almost interesting here that you know are these two pregnant females are they are they feeling for each other or is the other one coming to aid is there something I don't know like maybe there's some sort of afterbirth or she'll go like casing that she ends up eating from the other one I don't know but it's rather interesting and the other females have chosen to stay fairly far away and the football team who just gave birth the female just gave birth the other day are just zipping around the tank way more than usual which I don't know the reason for that but I do know that when a a shrimp has a saddle which is let's see if we've got one with a saddle that's real clear anywhere in sight but it's it's their ovaries and it's you see that yellow that looks like guts up in her head that will turn into a longer dip or what we call saddle full of eggs and then it will come it will head down her her spine so it will start up up here and it'll head down the spine and then she'll get fertilized and the eggs will drop down now I think what it is is an opening opens under the tail there and then the the male shrimp can fertilize but right now the female is in the very last process from what I've observed in the past and she is opening up the side armor she's flexing those panels that's why she shedded right before she before she buried up they often do that if you notice to your female shrimp are all getting new coats they'll hide because they're delicate for a week after that or so and then usually they'll proceed to become married and pregnant so looks like we're down to the very last maybe two or three eggs in there like I was saying and she's juggling them you can make out let's see oh there goes another one into the substrate she's got one hanging out from under her belly and she's gonna flick it out you see the yellow it's very interesting some of them have different colors come on focus blue come on focus got a of course the focus is screwed up at the last second all right but so now she's got this little yellow one and is she gonna flick it out of her body or store it back up because it's not ready it's definitely standing out and she has it internally I can tell that even though the camera can't she's probably trying to get the last little bits of the peel of the egg and then get rid of it now it could be that that one that's yellower than all the other ones inside of her it could have a mold on it and she could be determining whether she can clean that fungus off or whether it's too far gone and she just disposes of it in order to not infect the others out of habit even though there aren't really other eggs to infect at this point it's over so I'm gonna leave you here because we could be here for another hour or two for all I know but I hope you guys learned a little something I hope you enjoyed watching this and this was the miracle of life miracle of birth with blue dream neo caridina shrimp related to cherry shrimp and they're just given birth it's around midnight they tend to do it in the evening I've noticed probably when predators are less present to eat the babies usually they do it somewhere a little more hidden but clearly they feel fairly relaxed here and there comes the final eggs right there as we're closing out the video one just dropped right in between the track the cracks there's two left and one looks like it might be coming out and the other one she's definitely what she's doing with those little swimmer rats on her is she's assessing are those still good eggs or don't do I not bother so that's what's going on here there goes another little guy and let's see here that one came out white which is interesting it's already hidden but they'll hide for the first week sometimes up to three and then they'll come out now if conditions are very bad they can hide for like a month and not grow very fast but if you have good conditions like this tank the algae and the beneficial bacteria you'll get these babies who you can see are substantially smallest smaller than the adults still but they'll come out despite it being in the wide open they'll come out so now she's gonna be exhausted after she finishes here and it looks like so this wasn't I'm not thinking that this is a baby that she had walking around next to her I think that is still one of the older shrimp 'lets because usually they're a little more clear at this stage and it takes some a couple hours at least to color up but I could be wrong that could have been a large one that was stuck way up by her shoulder and in stomach and intestines but I'm gonna assume it's one of the other one of the other old ones so if you guys learn something like this if you want to help me get a better camera so I can zoom in on this really clearly and talk about the biology evolution the science the history and just you know hopefully help you guys out understanding these processes and maybe doing some troubleshooting for instance if she had gotten stuck here or had passed away I would know that I could cut her open very gently and those shrimp would probably be fine just sitting on the sponge filter for the evening since they were coming out tonight anyways but the eggs can also be placed into an egg tumbler which I can show you in another video how you can make those with just an air air hose and well an air pump I supposed to and a little container or a valve so I hope you guys are all doing well I hope your fish shrimp there doing well and hopefully this female recovers from the stress of pregnancy you can see that both of them already have new saddles forming that yellow there that can also be their gut or food in their intestines their brain and all that all packed into there although I want to say that their brain out there comes another baby right there so I don't know if you saw that but it's just gonna lay there so rather teeny tiny little shrimp late' and now we've lost her behind the Tupperware fog there comes another one if you just saw that so that's probably the last two right there so she's probably done now and she'll go find a place to hide and rest and she could be resting for several days after this and this female is next in line to have that happen now I think that this shrimp who just appeared out of nowhere right here this blue one next to the orange rock by the edge in the bottom corner of your screen that is one of the new ones and it does have that much pigment kind of just depends on how well form they are so there's no fish in this tank no fear of or anything like that and they can just focus on growing but I hope that this channel and this information has helped you guys learn something it's been interesting and you know maybe it saved you money each of these shrimp babies theoretically it could be worth you know whatever 10 bucks or five bucks depends where you live 3 bucks in your up or you know 20 bucks in the Midwest somewhere where there's no pet shops but I'd pay you know about about 9 or 10 bucks for a good quality blue dream shrimp and you know those babies coming out if they all died that's theoretically two to four hundred dollars dying on you not to mention it sad but hopefully this channel knowledge information in general is power and maybe if that helps you and you save that money you save those shrimp you feel good about it any number of things like that on my channel and it's

can't see on your screen but I'm seeing it you probably see in an orange or yellow ish color but that that happens sometimes where a few of the eggs just sit and she can't get to him and clean them all but it's really a miracle thank you for watching take care take care of the people around you the critters around you and yourself and I'll talk to you next time good night", "9jimWo_VNJY": "all

today we're working with the zips blue dream powered by crown what is it crown i think it's crown og is or crown royal something like that um again it's a hybrid pre-roll we're looking at blue dream right here so that one gram it was 30 off so it's six bucks it's a super deal 18.875 percent thc i'm sorry on the total cannabinoids 16.769 on the total thc .047 on the total cannabinoids it's in a basic or classic plastic tube tube pretty see-through let's dive right in shall we one hit i'll talk about it two hits score out of ten and then you guys gotta read the full review on respect my region to get the full idea of what's going on all right smells kind of sweet check out the j it's definitely got some nice light green color to it i can smell the berries and i can taste the berries it is packed a little bit tight so i'm gonna massage it out that basically just means i'm i'm going to squeeze and pinch it between my fingers kind of softly there we go all right you guys it's a beautiful day here in cali where's the lighter where'd he go where'd he go all right here it is shout out to jazzasaurus on the video today y'all we're hitting dispensaries reviewing products let me know give me a recommendation of where to go what to buy and we'll get to the review down the road all right you guys one hit all right that one kind of tasted like earthy burnt paper not the greatest hit on the first one so i'm gonna light it a little bit more and here's the official first hit here we go oh it's sweet and light kind of piney and definitely got some berries blue dream should be uplifting and have a nice pleasant body high you're not supposed to feel super [ __ ] up so overall i think that first hit definitely was what i would think blue dream should be like maybe a little bit more blueberry would have been desired but still good nonetheless all right you guys second hit there we go on the ash color the second hit got a little bit more earthy and a little bit more berry like but just not super super fruity and not super citrusy i think overall this product is somewhere around a 7.5 to an eight but when you think about a 30 disc discount and it's already you know 9 10 bucks to begin with that's a that's a great score for something that's definitely considered an affordable product so come check it out sherman oaks apothecary i love you guys let me know what you

Health Sciences flower this strain being Blue Dream it is a sativa dominant strain it's still a hybrid like every other strain as though and all aspects of the word I cannot stand that we even pick a dominance at all seeing as they are all absolute hybrids but that's just one tokers take if you will this strain comes from crossing an indica blueberry with a sativa haze and this strain definitely has the look of a haze dominant strain these have tightly packed nugs bright orange ii fiery tips of hairs but it also has this wild trim all over it I mean it's like devilish horns covering covering all these flowers here and I think that's why they had such a hard time parting with all the trim on this plant and that's why they left it it is just so frosty it's almost a crying shame to have probably trimmed what they even did trim off of these nugs but again these aren't fully developed turbines these are almost like sticks like frosty hairy sticks all over it you won't see many of the beaded heads of trichomes or terpenes across this flower at all but it is still a beautiful flower they've got going on here at $28 an eighth I mean how can you truly complain about that at all that is a flower that I will be going back for for sure medically speaking I felt like it was a great feeling throughout the entire experience but it wasn't very long-lasting my head felt great I felt like it almost even tackled a little bit of my pains I was a little sore from the day before before I tried this strain and I think that it very much tackled that issue as well it's a very light smoke it's not harsh they cured it very well there's nothing about that that shouldn't be smoked it's fantastic right here's where you kind of see we focus on what looks like a little bit of purple on the trim and that was like our only part of the plan that we really saw it on not many of the other nugs in the whole quarter that we scooped do we see much purple there was a little bit Sears in there it was a great flower I'll truly be coming back to Liberty Health Sciences for this strain again I thoroughly enjoyed it I think it's definitely worth the money at $28 an eighth again you cannot go wrong my friends my only hang-up of course being that the closest Liberty Health Sciences is all the way in Tallahassee and they no longer deliver their flour anymore they'll deliver everything else for free statewide but they stopped delivering flour I don't know if it's because of demand they can't meet they don't know how to organize it or whatever I hope to update otherwise later on but thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews and this is Liberty Health Sciences Blue Dream whole flower enjoy thank you so much for watching [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]", "iv7d-LlNS1o": "what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so you know how like the other day I ended up doing a candidates review on a test flavor and I also did a NASCAR video in the same outfit so I'm actually going to do that again and we were going to have a NASCAR uploaded tomorrow morning yet again at 10 a.m. but so candidates sent me that huge care package with all that stuff the other day and you guys saw the Z skittles can that I talked about the other day and they sent me a second can I'll catch up with you guys and release what that is right after the freaking intro [Music] mathaa [Music] [Music] some guys that ii can is blue dream what does that mean I don't know don't know at all am I gonna find out probably not just gonna find out what it tastes like and that's exactly what we're gonna freakin do today so let's take one of these pouches there's eight in this can the other day I only put one in my lip I am going to put two in this time I think I'm gonna put them both on copper but I want to put one on top one on the bottom well let's start with one a cop solid and let's put a second one on top yep so the cool thing about candidates and the cool thing about pouches is you can kind of conceal it a little bit better than what you could like a traditional pinch of dip so with that I mean I still kind of look like a chipmunk when I'm talking but if I were to properly space them out and kind of put them to the side you guys went even freaking know that I had pouches in so like if you're at work you can totally do a pouch up top not have to worry about spitting or anything like that just keep it in your frickin lip and go that route so in the meantime I'm gonna freakin record a NASCAR video give you guys my honest opinion on blue dream candidates test can and will catch up here shortly bye well it's been about 15 to 20 minutes as a chaser pretty good now cuz I got it like oh my canine teeth up top and it's really pushing her down in there really really pushing her down in there so anyway I forgot to mention so I didn't record it yesterday which was day 28 we're still kicking ass though still doing a freaking remarkable job on this challenge believe it or not I think it's at nine o'clock tonight we're counting down our final 24 hours of the 30 day no tobacco challenge now I've been asked plenty of times am I going to be going back to dipping normal tobacco well just being completely honest video I don't know but I also don't want to lie and be like yeah no I'm definitely not going back to tobacco because I know chances are probably gonna get a can and do it but it will probably be a lot less than what I normally did so before doing this 30-day challenge and this is what blows my freakin mind with this whole challenge is I would dip like a can and a half a day like having such a long commute for work it's like an hour and a half hour and 40 minutes what do you think I do during that time I dip so like I would just dip and dip and dip and dip and dip and no matter what I was doing man I was dipping you guys see it every video I pretty much had a freaking dip in so will I go back to it probably but I won't do it as much as what I used to knowing that I can use something though such as candidates to make myself quit it's a really good feeling and then hopefully you know if Canada sees this video you guys have an awesome freakin product and that's just 100% in my opinion I'm not being biased because they sent me stuff and different things like that and they did they sponsored this challenge there are plenty of companies out there and it's not just candidates candidates hands down will always be my number one preference and I'm going to tell you guys why Canada was the only one to reach out ever I mean yeah I had sponsorships through different things Mishimoto which no offense but every motek and Larry gets sponsored by Mishimoto it's just a matter of how big your sponsorship is with them six speed and everything like that like I've had vehicle sponsorships but like you would think with having a YouTube channel with almost 6,000 subscribers like no rough country would have reached out to me in reference to the Jeep or reached out to me in reference to the truck but none of that happened I'm not trying to bash rough country because rough country might end up doing something with me down the road it's just I'm too small of a channel maybe they don't know who the hell that I am but canidates has paid attention to me going way back we're talking literally years like two years that Canada has been communicating and working with me and hands down just knowing that their product is quality and I know a lot of people have a tendency of bitching about Canada saying oh it's so expensive a freaking can well let me tell you something one pouch of candidates will last you a very long time if you're a dipper that legitimately just puts in a pinch and then throws it out in 15 minutes one you're wasting your own personal money too you're not really getting anything from or like this the longer you keep this in man the better your freaking feeling so like this will be in my mouth for the next 40 freakin minutes like at least they make good quality stuff and they are working with smaller people such as myself to create things that are the future of tobacco the future of CBD the future of THC it's so cool and my personal opinion to be able to be a freakin part of that and like I said candidates huge thank you to you guys for doing this whole challenge and I'm sure I'm gonna say the same [ __ ] tomorrow but I really really do appreciate it because when nobody else had any type of interest in my channel or supporting my channel you know company wise canidates has freaking been there since day one in conclusion this personally if I had both of these in front of me I'm choosing this I'm choosing the Blue Dream and it might be it might be I didn't get the full taste with the Z skittles now I do have to win so in comparison to only having one in yesterday the taste of this is like sound that's stupid it's a little bit more fruity but it also gives you like a relaxed calm vibe like it just and then oh that's super weird to say like that a dip can do that to you but 100% it gives like a blueberry frutos vibe and it just relaxes you and now I think that's why I love the CBD so much is it's like you know you have something in your mouth and it's juicing you can just swallow it and you taste it all the time and it's a nice subtle taste it's not like a boom swift kick steel toe to the balls it's it's actually something that's smooth and tastes really good I would definitely say the Blue Dream would be my choice number one over the Z skittles now like I said there's nothing wrong with diseased skittles I'm going to be trying these again disease but obviously not on freakin camera so in conclusion candidates if you see this one I would really spoke to them I think they're both 100% capable of being good products that would sell abso-freakin'-lutely it's not as strong of a kick as such the mint now the mint is supposed to have a really really strong taste to it but anyway guys this video was for day 28 and 29 coming up on the last 24 hours if this is your first time watching a video on the freakin channel give this video a big thumbs up smash the subscribe button down below we're like 10 subscribers away from 6k that's freaking all so I will see you guys tomorrow morning for the nascar heat up low", "rgBRCFMulDU": "what is that be to famish above askus you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today now I won't be doing a hotbox video no either today or tomorrow so you guys stay tuned for that gonna be having a couple videos coming up and also just like weird reviews you know like I feel like I'm boring you guys with just cartridge you've users [ __ ] but I don't know I'm like maybe just stop from the cartridge reviews a little bit well I'm still gonna smoke on the ship but you know I'm just gonna switch up the vetoes a little bit for you guys but it's been a while literally since I've done this dizzy asti review like literally months so I had to ran into this blue person I guess to say that the blue purse is like one of the best best flavors out there right now from Steve Zissou and I guess one of the newest ones as well so if I'm wrong on that I'm the best flavor let me know because I haven't tried all the Stacy's uh this one's like the third one I've tried before but yeah they say this one tastes like berries and [ __ ] so I'm like I'm really curious about that so I have purchased this for like like 40 bucks like around around there I'm not really sure about the price but this one's from my dispensary I had gotten my fee no they're here Modesto so this one's a blue purse and on the top it says blue club blue gummi flavor so we're gonna check it out guys so I had lost my steez battery so the good thing my smoke shot they carry out a fake ass dizzy battery so these ain't authentic I already know so they probably get them off somewhere but the good thing the smoke shop carries them you know you don't got I didn't have to drive back to the dispensary so good thing we have that so we're gonna get into the cartridge guys if let me know what you guys up to on this Saturday Saturday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know gonna watch some Netflix in a little bit guys I'm gonna pop this up for you guys and I appreciate those guys out of me uh if you guys had to add me on my Instagram go ahead and do so I would appreciate that I just made a new Instagram for the channel I mean I have always had an Instagram but that was my personal like my personal account so out of maker for the channel so here it is guys a gram of the blue burst Izzy looks pretty dope you know Stacy packaging I really like it a lot so it's nice and simple but it also looks pretty good you know and here we have that California logo it's a sticker guys so there's a lot of people that ask me is they like in grade there is the sticker but this one's a sticker as you guys can see hopefully you guys can all get a good close-up on that but this one's pretty good you know the color on is nice and light it looks pretty good you know it has a nice decent color to it and I'm going to just try it to see if ooh what it tastes like oh [ __ ] right off the bat you know it does taste like berries I'm not gonna lie it tastes like a gummy berry tastes really good so I'm going to open this battery nothing too serious about this better you know just straight simple I grab the red edition there's like different colors and [ __ ] like old black orange I like the red one I had the black one which I ended up losing so ended up getting the red one simple battery you know let me know what you guys prefer play a recision you know a hard choice I mean like put in place a little more plugin plays are a little bit more uh more flavor wise you know but they have high policy as well as dizzy you know their cartridges are like 80% as well this one's a 83% I forgot to show you guys 80% cartridge so part I should say so I'm gonna open this real quick [ __ ] nah whoever got that germ axe or that lifestyle spray man good at me my [ __ ] me someone [ __ ] pay you man I need that [ __ ] ASAP out here in California right here world from everything's gone man people are going crazy right now for that [ __ ] but if you had a tartars man out of state people got the jug on that get out of me would appreciate that man but you know you this one's a red battery and they've had the red battery before but I seen some people have a gold one which looks pretty dope but stay simple so you have a simple battery you know we're gonna head and uh get the magnet and plug it in you guys are smoke along with me go ahead and do so would really appreciate that guys haven't really smoked all day I've been like really busy I'm out doing some errands and [ __ ] but hopefully you guys smoke along with me cheers guys I'm glad let you guys know this [ __ ] tastes like some people say it tastes burnt dizzy tastes burger but I don't know it just depends on where you get him from so where to see oh [ __ ] I'm really really surprised some Stacey's that I've tried before like the turpan the tur penis wasn't really there but this one's here you know taste straight like berries like one of our boys told me that's what it tasted like like gummy like a gummy bear it tastes pretty good you know I'm gonna take a beer here see if I can get it like uh that taste is still my mother she's good I'm gonna try to take a blinker for you guys all right guys so we had charged the [ __ ] battery cuz they came [ __ ] low battery so we couldn't get a really good hit off it but let me know um I don't know if I'm tripping but happen has happened to me before but a lot of people say that some states burnt bottom oh is because of it's not legit or I don't know they say the big battery Stacey I love you guys seem that big stingy battery that that may be the issue because of how it's a big battery and the poly burns the oil so I don't know let me just let you guys know about cheers guys definitely gets a hit now but it's definitely definitely like berries you know it tastes Halle good I'll describe it as a gummy blueberry gummy exactly it should taste good I didn't really think I was gonna be this tasty you know there's some Stevie's there I've tried before that just tastes like straight this in it but this one does taste like this little bit tastes like a really good distillate you know I mean it's really fruity you know I'd really recommend this bluebirds man out of all of them if you guys have a choice get the blueberries you know if you guys want to [ __ ] with this Daisy get that blueberries it should taste good straight berries I'm gonna take a blinker for you guys if I get out this [ __ ] I gotta go to the store Matt like I said if you guys have that hats on it ties that lifestyle spray your knee up man we'd really appreciate it I'll pay you guys you guys should be a package on your mind but cheers guys take a blinker these blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play it's really really smooth you know and even when you take a blinker it still doesn't taste burn at all get the nice full flavor of it it's just pretty good you know but yeah guys I really appreciate you guys for watching my veto stay stay safe out there you know wash your hands to be safe and Mia guys thanks for watching", "Fbwg5oArDB0": "- People are like, what\nis your favorite strain? What do you like indica,\nsativa, or hybrid? I don't discriminate. (smooth music) I love sativas during the day. My sativas of choice would\nbe Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, Super Lemon Haze, great for creativity, great for cleaning your\nhouse, which I never do. - I'm gonna stick with sativas honestly, like right now I'm smoking Zeta a lot. We had this top shelf Zeta\nthat was really delicious, it's a classic strain it's\nbeen around for a long time. Sour Diesel, you can't\nreally go wrong with those. - For a sativa, I've always\nliked Strawberry Banana. It's just a nice, mellow\nif you're creative and stuff like that so, I like doing that. - One of my all-time\nfavorites is Trainwreck. I went to school in Northern California so that was always a staple. - There's a strain that\nwas named after me. It was called Juicy Gia, that was a strain and it was at the store for years. It was a sativa, Green Crack. - Green Crack is one\nof my favorite strains, for sativa because it's an\nenergetic, great daytime stain. It keeps you going. - My favorite stain would be\nWhite Widow or Blue Dream. Every bud is gonna have a little bit of a different buzz to it\nand those in particular just have a nice effect,\nit's a chill kind of. - Blue Dream, first of all\nit smells like amazing, and then it looks amazing,\nand the way it tastes, I was like oh this is for me. - The only stains I kind of stay away from is like kind of the heavier\nmore energetic sativas. I know that my body chemistry\ndoesn't enjoy that as much. Green Crack, just straight\nDurban Poison, Jack Herer, things like that I'm like. - Night time indica is\nOG if you want to relax. OG Kush, Kush, anything with\nthat, OG is my go to strain. I love OG Kush because I\nstruggled with anxiety growing up and I came off pharmaceuticals\nwhen I was in my 20s and I personally found OG Kush\nkind of really levels me out. - Just like straight OG\nKush is a really good one. - I love OG, I'm an OG\ngirl, I like the ones that keep you nice and mellow. Can you tell, right?\n(laughs) - For indica, Northern Lights is probably one of my favorites stains. It's just an overall great\nbody, really relaxing. - I'm an indigo woman\nhands down, I love cookies. A good OG, Snoop executive. - My favorite would\nprobably be the Snoop Lion. Executive branch. - I would say Skywalker\nand Girl Scout Cookies. The hybrids and the indicas,\nthose are really good. - For day midday hybrids, Gorilla Glue, I love Purple Tangie, that was magical. - Tangerine Dream, it's\njust a really nice high because it's super functional. You can just go out\nabout, be social with it, if you want to be creative\nand like go dance, or go draw, or just be artistic\nwith it you totally can. Or if you just want to workout with it, it's a very active high. - I think my favorite strain\nof all-time is probably GSC, formerly know as Girl Scout Cookies. It makes me feel creative, relaxed. Definitely a favorite for me. - Funny, I'll be at work\nselling GSC, now as it's called, and walk across the street\nto the grocery store and there's Girl Scouts\nselling Girl Scout cookies, offering to sell me Girl Scout cookies. I don't offer the same thing\nback but, it's kind of funny.", "vFKNwkNtVPk": "t.h caesar i was cracking yeah so i got some blue dream here in the high times cannabis cup 2019 colorado flower hybrid category surprisingly we still see blue dream out there it is the number one recreational strain i believe don't ask me why but i know cash croppers love it because it [ __ ] throws down the blue dream billionaire is that a seed no that's not okay blue dream billionaires i was talking about it looks all right for blue dream it looks all right i've seen more solid chunky bugs all before let's see if there's any seeds see how dry it's on the dryer side it still has some chunkiness to it it's not turning the dust when i squeeze it i don't know if you have peeped that but it said like 26 or something overall kind of it's a 30 something i was like again they need to stop doing this [ __ ] let's see total cannabinoids 21 to 33 are you wait whoa okay my bad i thought that said 50 that's point 50. still 20 to 32 percent thc that's uh i don't know it's probably closer to the 20 side all right let's give this check first of all see if there's any seeds and smell it real quick it just smells like [ __ ] commercial commercial like weed i haven't smoked blue dream in a while for a good reason but the same reason why i don't smoke oh geez i'm just over it just got too commercial for me but then again it's almost hard to find og anymore that's like legit because everybody's on the cookies waves no seeds no stems let's get the filter in there i just can't believe somebody entered blue dream all right put finishing touches on the j all right so lighting up the blue dream all right see if it changes any lighter borax they got roaches ah she's getting uh slightly lighter it's burning weird uh it's a darker ash for sure it's burning weird and fast too i know dispensaries grow it because the [ __ ] you can [ __ ] grow it with your eyes closed and you're still gonna [ __ ] get wait [Music] oh god all right let's do some math looks 3.0 smell it smells like dried chewed up bubble gum sorry i'm that's what it smells like now this specific batch of blue dream just way too commercial smelling 2.0 3.0 plus 2.0 taste i don't taste anything this is like the [ __ ] new ports of [ __ ] like cannabis i feel like oh no for taste 2.0 it doesn't taste horrible it's better than regs burn is burning weird 2.0 plus effect if anything the effect and the looks are probably the best thing it's got going for it um i don't see it [ __ ] testing that anywhere near [ __ ] 32 or anything like it says on the jaw anywhere close 32 percent nah man that's a pipe dream effect it's definitely blue dream has a different effect compared to all the other uh strains out there like in this kit at least it's more on the you know daytime active kind of side i feel it more of my eyes than in the body for sure kind of feel slightly more talkative as well but i'd say if i had to give it an effect i'd probably give it a 3.25 equals 12.5 divided by 5 equals 2.45 i'd say somewhere around there honestly it's like it just looks good and the effect is slightly decent but again really not a fan of blue dream not trying to like it could have even had no name on it and you could kind of tell for sure but all right thanks everybody that is flower hybrid entry number 20 hot denver high time cannabis cup 2019. see ya", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "mvfspRArb2o": "what to do YouTube is that what mr. hu expect okay this [ __ ] down and

some badass wax and fit it up though and still call it the same label you know be far as [ __ ] and then people could buy this [ __ ] same cartridge and fill it up with some [ __ ] and still say it's far as [ __ ] but boom bro you're smoking what pesticides pg/vg and all that [ __ ] they put in it to cut it I don't know it's just it's a gamble it's a gamble guys and people out there saying like

somebody asked how to open these you can see they got a little thumbprint thing there you press on that and then you got to pull this little damn thing out there you go if that doesn't work I just take a knife to where pair of scissors and cut the corners just plastic so we ordered two more blue dream the limit of two for delivery is over now so you can order more than that if you need I did call them ass at today take a close-up still not being accurate real good you can see all the leaves on that one it's kind of like one side is good the other side kind of like I left him laying down or something like these if we turn these over it's mainly leaves on the bottom side but you've only just now you can hear the snap to it you can see the crystals on there just pop that one back in their hole and again they're coming in nineteen point six THC here's the second one we got today you see that about the same this sides kind of good the other side still got all the leaders of it but you can see those crystals I mean it's not code it I mean it is code it but I mean back up here for a minute guys you can see those crystals on it so yeah it doesn't look bad don't smell the best I wouldn't say it smells like hay but I don't think it smells as good as it did the first time around but the THC on this one's higher than it was I just gotta find it yeah the first one was coming at 18 per 0.3% the new ones are coming in at 19 6 so a little bit different and I think the first one smelled a little different they do have different packaging now - this was the first one that's about half that size it's a little different but yeah this stuff's not bad-looking it's all dry call it and consider it you know super drive it I would say it was done pretty close to proper like I said didn't have as much of a blueberry taste this time but I've noticed when the THC content changes so does the flavor just we might still have a mild blueberry taste more of an earthy I guess there's a little blueberry back in there affect wise this is a good sativa guys it works for me it doesn't make me antsy in the morning it doesn't give you that pressure behind my eyes like some of them does I can do this and work fine it doesn't make me real hungry I like that for the mornings bettan worse than burning one on the way out the door overworked and cry right there you're starving to death you got to stop and eat take more time I mean I like to eat as good as the next guy but time in a place for everything so yeah if vectorize like I said I like it if I didn't like it I wouldn't order two more so that gives me 300 blue dreams I still got something left in their delivery they still have star killer or not star killer super a 5 there alla blue dream for delivery you might have to check a store if you want some of it wow I think that's about it guys I know soon as I stop the video I'll think of all the [ __ ] that I want to say during this year for 28 bucks I'm impressed also this is their lowest tier stuff they didn't come out going all were great they come out going we got weed buddy and you're not claiming to be the best this is their lowest grade stuff so they didn't come out charging 50 going think inertia it was the greatest they knew they was still learning so these are the cheapest trains they will have better stuff eventually they are said that their self this is their lowest string this is their tier one or however you want to stage them up but they will have higher Cuong quality and higher prices too so this isn't as good as some of the stuff out there for 50 bucks and then it's better than some I like this better than the stuff I got from Knox to be honest with you this is at least worth the price so it might not be better than the $50 thing from things but at least it was worth the money you spent for it I think that's being the key here is not getting you know yeah you can get some real fire stuff for 50 but for 28 consider you're gonna get two of these for almost $50 for a little like 56 bucks you'll get two of these so I don't think anything's twice as good as that for pity but you know what see I'm saying so that's gonna be it guys say hi to all the new subscribers out there make sure you leave me a thumbs up up there in the corner that's the thumbs up throw me a comment down below let me know what you guys are talkin on today this holiday weekend I'm gonna try to do some more videos I'm planning on getting pretty toasty today I don't think I have to do anything I might cut my grass is getting wild looking out there so until next video guys keep on talking", "K7icqzcDtX0": "happy Valentine's Day everybody and welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking the time to watch it today and I want to let everybody know how happy I am that I hit the 42 subset on YouTube and let everybody know that as soon as we get 200 subs we will be doing a live video recording and also I want to welcome everybody to the family let's get to it in this video I'm going to show you the Gemma door premium flower that I picked up from fluent in Tallahassee I paid $50 for this eighth and it came in at twenty three point eight six five percent THC and it was bought of just a few days before I bought it making it super fresh plus as you can see there a cure their flowers ooh just beautiful perfection every single one of those buds is glowing in trichomes and this 8th weight 3.5 7 grams smell a strong of sweet fruity pine and earthy that type of smell that makes my heart skip a beat enjoying flavor is strong sweet pine and earthy the fruity smell does not come through to the flavor as much as I expected first thing the strain gives me is too talky toxin it makes me very social which is a very good thing for my antisocial self then there's the wave of energy and happiness from within that keeps me dancing from side to side even when the music is off that comes along with an anxiety or stress super mega vacuum combo as it finds and saw and disappears all of my stress and anxiety if and every time it also gives me a great amount of focus allowing me to sit my squirrel brain down and make it listen for the duration of the effects closer to the middle and inside of the effects I do catch myself doing the total opposite which means I find myself focusing way too much and getting lost in my head I don't want to subject my muscles were loose and my normal here and there muscle aches were gone for the duration of the effects as well as my chronic back pain was lowered for to about a number two for the duration of the offense can I work on the strain oh yeah I worked in which I'm happy dancing with it oh joy focus and can melt straight and anxiety away like butter it's a dream workday for me Macon's Emma doors now officially tied hand-in-hand with Subaru and sour D so for my favorite work strains this is another one of the strains that I recommend for all day and night use and in all honesty if you see this strain go ahead and give it a try I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another

you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't

going on guys tony robb here back from another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day um if my voice and my articulation is a little messed up well that's because i just got my wisdom teeth removed a few hours ago like maybe a little over 10 hours ago and my mouth is a little bit swollen and that's not gonna stop me from making a youtube video and like i always do i push through and yeah so i hope you guys are going to enjoy this video because this is going to be a review yeah let's get it started all right what we have here today is a wax pen you know with cartridges thc and all that good stuff i didn't even open it i bought this from a local dispensary it's from the company good supply um this is a indica strain it has 880 808.76 milligrams of thc um there's a little bit less than five milligrams of cbd and a little less than a total of seven milligrams in the whole thing of cbd um it weighs about 0.5 grams it was packaged the 24th of march 2020 and yeah without further ado let's open up the packet and i was gonna use my mouth to open up this packet but i will not um yeah i can't wait to use this i bought it specifically because i was gonna get operated and i could not smoke and i know that vaping it isn't better than just regularly smoking it but i prefer to try to inhale the cleanest smoke possible so i don't get it infected some of my friends smoke backwards the day of their operation nothing happened but i prefer not to take the risk because i'm an unlucky person we have the good supply this pack cost me 58 it comes with the cartridge which is blue dream and it comes with the good supply vaporizer battery pack so it comes with included comes with a battery usb charger a usb chargeable it's 4 000 it's 400 milliamp hours three available temperatures standard 500 510 thread include yes and here it is yep this is what it looks like this is the packaging and this is what the thc box looks like so i'm gonna open it up and is this it um that's how you open up the box i don't feel like ruining the box wait oh okay i guess it opens up like this what is this right here like what does this do absolutely nothing okay okay so this whole box wow you could smell it through the cartridge that's sick damn smells like kind of smells actually the actual blue dream not even gonna lie with you about that so this is the cartridge this looks like a regular thc cartridge and we all know it's not fake so here we have the box and we have user instructions so i'll keep it here and i'll focus it and i'll read the instructions usage charge battery before use turn 510 threaded cartridge clockwise onto battery do not over tighten push button rapidly five times to turn on off led light will flash when batteries turn on off push button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating settings preheating push button rapidly two times no led will change colors push button one time to quit preheating when ready to use press and hold the button inhale through the mouthpiece turn off remove cartridge from battery when not in use the battery is not waterproof um do not expose battery to the direct sunlight and not expose battery to freezing temperatures do not tamper with battery charging turn battery clockwise into usb charger provided you do not use other usb chargers not over tighten usb indicator red equals charging green equals charge storage conditions store in a cool dry place between 4 and 30 degrees celsius troubleshooting cartridge connectivity issues button will will flash red remove cartridge and re attach tightly low battery indication led will flash 10 times charge battery usb provided restrict the airflow clog preheat for five seconds before vaping all right so here we have this baby right here so yeah my bad for the cut the audio software just stopped recording so i had to restart it but at least i got the supply pack charged so this comes with the battery pack right here this beautiful baby right here i charged it up you need to charge it before using it but at least the audio cutting helped me charge it up then you have the specific charger just like joule they're trying to make you not use a regular old charger they want you to use the specific charger you gotta screw it on and then you can charge it to tell if it is fully charged this thing is gonna turn green and this thing is gonna turn green so that's what happened it turned green and yeah i got it fully charged so without further ado let's uh get it started i'm gonna take one puff one puff only i'm not gonna puff it too much i'm not gonna start [ __ ] around with the smoke in my mouth because as i just said previously i just got my mouth operated so [ __ ] that i'm not gonna risk having an infection so yeah what we have here uh i need the instructions actually i'll keep the instructions in front of me so that way i don't mess up so here we have the pod the wax pod i'm gonna take off this cap right here come on baby yes sir got that cap off and let's screw it on they said not too tight it's not too tight and let's remove this over here and here we have it the blue dream distillate yes sir so with the blue dream this lit how do you turn it on push rapidly five times turn it on so one two three four five it's on no led will flash when batteries turn on press rapidly press button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating static settings one two three it just flashed blue uh one two three now it's red one two three now it's white okay um what are the colors like what's the the the you know the the chart the color chart um preheating rapidly twice okay one two so this is the preheating okay okay [ __ ] it so i'll take a puff okay that was one puff i'll take a second one hmm tasted actually fairly good didn't hurt too much my uh my molar my wisdom tooth area whatever so this thing actually gives me decent size drags actually wow and yeah so i'm gonna turn it off so i got my three four puffs in so another one last one all right so turn it off how do i turn it off press rapidly five times so one two three four five so is that it one two three four five one two three four five nothing i so i think it's off turn this off got the cartridge off so i had a little piece here i'll keep that protected and i'll put this on top of the cartridge so i can protect the cartridge and um i'll try to keep it standing up so i can prevent the hc from spilling over so my thoughts i can already feel the buzz coming in it's obviously a wax so it's a little stronger airflow was good it didn't feel like those cheap ass uh vapes has a good cartridge the battery is good the only downside i think is the charger the the screw-on charger i guess that's new i just lost the screw-on charger so you're pretty much screwed losing the screw-on charger if you lose it because um i don't know where the hell you can buy this except from a cannabis store or online on amazon but yeah make sure not to lose your screw-on charger make sure not to lose the cartridges the lady at the dispensary told me you can keep it pretty much anywhere in your pocket whatever i don't trust that hole so i'm gonna keep it somewhere warm and tidy so it doesn't melt or it does not uh lose its potency i'm gonna keep this somewhere safe too and overall good product seven out of ten if i would give it a number uh it was decently expensive the cartridges aren't expensive i think it's just the battery pack and the starter kit that's expensive um the vaporizer got me high i feel a little higher and a lot more elevated than i was a few mil a few moments ago obviously the whole product is good uh like i said seven out of ten pick it up if you want something discreet and that will let you get high on the low low um yeah that's pretty much it i don't have much to say about this product more than this gets you high gets the job done good ass blue dream i can't taste the blue dream that much and the high i guess reflects the blue dream high but not too much because it's a distillate in wax so it's a little stronger it's a sharper buzz but yeah

you the progress on my blue dream room and a couple of issues I'm having with it I also wanted to cover a quick topic about dirt burst hydro so you can kind of see I only have one week left in nutrients so I'll do the week six overdrive mix on this room and then after that it will just be getting flush for two weeks the first simple issue I'm having here is with this plant the leaves have turned pretty yellow on me you know and then there's one right back over there that's doing the same thing but I think it's because I needed to get down there and just twist the buckets because they were stopping the water from being able to move in and out so I think I got that issue solved because everything else looks really good but is what I wanted to say about dirt verse hydro and my experience is that for me dirt they gave me one of the best quality weed today I ever grew I started out in dirt did really good in it and I really liked it so as far as quality goes you know definitely has a distinct smell and taste to it and the buds don't get as large in dirt unless obviously you're growing in you know 35 or 45 gallon arrow pots or you're doing outside dirt or something where you know you can really really get them big the other thing with third versus the hydro is that I'm able to get these things topped and recovering much quicker than I can in dirt you know dirt seems to take longer for a recovery rate versus hydro hydro you know I plant these things and I can come in here the next day or the day after that and there's no shock they're already growing they're already ready to be topped you know it's it's really one of those things that I really do enjoy over dirt but then the downfalls of it is that in hydro you have no buffer for the root zones you know you're just in water in hydro so with dirt you are able to control things like root rot a lot more you you know you won't lose your crop as quickly and dirt as you will and hydro things don't happen as quickly and then there's the yield difference the yield for me and hydro I mean this looking at is one of these knives and figured I'll just grab this one I mean this it's it's just rock hard and I know I shouldn't be squeezing it like that but I wanted to get an idea and it still has grow for another three weeks it'll only be weeks this plan is technically and I new extreme I wouldn't see these results as quickly in there I only vets for three weeks and that was an accident I should have clipped this thing at two weeks so you know and I mean that's from transplanting the clone so anybody that grows in dirt knows that that's kind of difficult to get this many coalesce this many tops off of 15 plants in that short amount of time in dirt but other than that I really do like dirt I like the Indyk that's coming out of dirt and cocoa gross too so I do plan on switching my rooms over to cocoa and I found a potential of being able to mix cocoa and with this hydroton and run dinheiro bags you know but I just need to talk with the guys that do that a little bit more and figure it out but anyways I just want to go over those quick subjects I might have missed something I'm not sure I have turn to my dehumidifier down a 45 percent I am empty in it every two days and I'm doing a reservoir change right now that's why that hose is in there and flushing the system out so I hope you guys enjoyed the video hope you can hear me over these fans and any more questions or comments you know just send it my way and I'll get to them best I can alright YouTube you have a good night and keep growing these", "j1uFvWmihGE": "what's up guys reaper here today we're gonna be talking about row of cartridges how to spot a fake one now this one is going to be one that is kind of simple but it is also going to be extremely extremely tricky and it's going to come down to really one or two things right first of all this is the road that I got I knew that it was pretty hot I knew that it was fake pretty much before I got it just because of the processing on it when my buddies hit me I was like bro I got some rosin Lanka oils I know you've been looking for some Walkers especially asking the cross hanging up the price I was like man [ __ ] I knew they were fake but I was like let me get him he's like I said they'd always says good ol never bought bad oil from this guy but came home that not well actually not that not the next night I didn't I have really didn't even test them out that much price tag on I'm the next not one of my subscribers sent me up on the Instagram asked me how I locked them as opposed to the pic on Instagram I say how Lachlan asked me ways the spot Romans and I was like did I really not even done any research you know so I did a little bit of research for him and within 30 seconds on him I was fake mine was fake for sure 100% the ones that he sent me seemed real but I did a little bit more research and this is where we're gonna get it this at right so the number one thing you want to look for on these boxes is right here there will be you want the California label you know the little California thing I'm just gonna see if it was back here but it's not you know what I'm talking about you need the California thing and then you want the THC percentage and stickers right on the box already it needs to be in stickers so don't let your guy tell you man they were on there they got pulled off blah blah blah all this [ __ ] no so that right there is it you wanted to have stickers that's how you're gonna tell right there if it's real or fake but here's the issue guys this is the car by the way 18 21 years or older smoke along with me if you are that age cheers guys great pull the flavor is amazing it tastes like sweet tarts it's not artificial it's a nice clean flavor the highest grade it lasts it does take about four or five hits to get a no let me tell you let me let me go into this right here if you just want to get a little if you need to like try to help your anxiety or you want to you know just get a little little relaxation calming feeling one two three puffs you're good but if you want to get a buzz if you want to get buzzed you want to get high you want to get smacked you need about four or five but the thing is guys the high with this is so clean and calm it's it's nice it's a nice calming feeling obviously it's it's supposed to be an indica but like I said it's fake so we don't even know if this is an indica in here it does have indica effects now could that be a placebo effect I don't know but you know it is what it is the only thing that I like I said though there's nothing to complain about the hot laughs the flavor is good the pull is good the oil is good in here and it is burning up quicker than I would lock though I've only had this for three days now and I've not been really heavy hitting it and it's going down quite a bit one more cheers guys so now we're going to get into the convoluted [ __ ] right they make fakes with stickers on them the newer fakes that are coming out have the stickers on them some made up amounts just put on there slept on there so now you're saying well how do I know if I'm getting one the trill unless you go in to a dispensary and buy yourself you don't know unless there is another way now this is what we're going to talk about unless you do that you're not going to know there is one other way there is called a store locator did they have for their side and will tell you every store and location did they sell them at that where they are sold and then even then even then you're like oh man I don't know about this or that or what if this happens or that happens no worries real rose now come with a QR code on their books so you just scan it on your phone on the app they have a rose reward app from what on the research I did and it comes on their pups up right then in there you know if it's real or not so Rove has I went into this like man they need to do something because like from what I can tell it's very hard to spot a fake aside just from those stickers in that store locator and then when you're getting deliveries and you're getting on this [ __ ] and you're getting shipments sent to you it's like man how can I tell for real how I mean it's like one of those things where it's like man but then I saw that QR code thing and I was like man props to them for doing that because you know like it you people don't want to throw money and [ __ ] that's not real like if I would have the price I paid for this I knew it was fake right and I'm happy with the price I paid but if I would have paid a price that would adjust the FIDE it being from the railroad company a dispensary price or a prostitute in an illegal state that a lot of these places these people will bump up and throw 5 10 15 even $20 tax on I would have been super mad so you know I can't that's why I'm doing this [ __ ] you guys hopefully this will help somebody but my final thoughts on this was whoever faked it did a good job like I said props to the guy if but I do think that people would just be better off buying their own all these people that have great skills and talent they're going on here week they're gonna put in a position to where they have to buy either these fake cards I mean the fake company carts you know what I mean by that I mean a real company they took real company that put fake cards from that company and then put all in it so and the sad thing is either they can one do that or to put them in stuff like exotics and Mario's Supremes off lights all that dumb stupid [ __ ] so what's the to base the options here can I put my good product in these shitty companies packs that nobody wants to buy or should I put my good product and these fake company packs so the logical choice is gonna be my product is good I can make you know my product shouldn't be put on these standards I want to put them here but now here's the issue is you're gonna [ __ ] people over unless you're doing it for this price right here to where people know like man there's no way that's real that's the only way it should be done but it'd be better off getting done with there should be like a I don't know man there's there has to be a better way than this but I guess as long as people know they hey these are fake those a lot of these TKOs are fake there's certain not just sticky Oh a lot everything's pretty much fake as [ __ ] right now unless you're walking into dispensary and getting it or you can get this [ __ ] super verified if you're in an illegal state or you're in a medical state you know like if you're in an illegal state fully legal recreational you you know preying on having problems but it's just uh it's just crazy out there I know guys unfortunately we're gonna have to wait it out we're gonna have to wait it out of here too until everything gets legal everything gets passed and then at that point you know it'll be on everyone but I'm gonna talk to you guys later thanks for watching subscribe if you're not gonna follow me on Instagram like the Reaper I'll link it down below I will link everything that I've put here down below that way you guys can go and research a little bit further yourself I hope you have a great rest here today", "2WgaCdNdC7U": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabina holistic health

energizing and motivating strain that keeps some body relaxation of an indica dream queen promotes energetic relaxed feelings similar to glass slipper and typical of many sativa dominant hybrid

intense as strains with higher percentages of thc as seen in many strains with upwards of 20 percent thc jasmine is an excellent medical strain that has been effective in treating hiv aids and

mattresses give you the ability to get the best of all worlds and today I'm gonna be talking about six of my favorite hybrid mattresses telling you everything you need to know about the mattresses and who they're good fit for basically by the end of the video you could have a pretty good idea which one even want to get so stay tuned alright if you want to learn more about these mattresses or you want a personal recommendation via our mattress quiz definitely check that out at max clarity calm alright so what is a hybrid mattress basically steel support coils with a premium foam on top so something like memory foam or latex that gives you the ability to get the best of both worlds of those different materials alright so we have different types of hybrid mattresses here of all different types of materials and feels so I think you're really gonna like one of the mattresses here so having said that let's jump into some topics first of our list is the casper hybrid mattress I really like the original Casper and this is basically the same but just with coils in the sport layer instead of foam so it has a nice balanced foam feel overall it's about a 6 out of 10 I really like it for side sleepers has very very good pressure relief has something called zone construction so in the middle it's giving a little bit firmer so if you're on your back or stomach it's give me a little bit firmer a little bit more supportive when you're on your side seem a little bit more pressure relieving so it's very good for really all three sleeping positions but it's about six out of ten there's really a lot to like about this mattress thanks a bodiless is the ghost bed flex mattress it is a memory foam hybrid mattress if you want all the advantages of memory foam without the drawbacks I would go with the ghost bed flex mattress here it's about a six and a half out of ten to ride that medium firmness range I really like it for back and side sleepers because that memory foam on top it's very good in pressure relieving for side sleepers yet because of the coils is very supportive and comfortable overall for back sleepers as well as sleep school it's also a very good option for couples at isolated motion very well so there really is a lot like about this mattress as well next finalist is the bear hybrid mattress they've got steel support coils but then a memory foam like top layer it is memory foam like it actually supposed to relieve pressure better than memory foam does and I think that might actually be the case it's also a more responsive it's not contrat piece so there's really lot to like about the top layer there find it to be a very pressure relieving very good on my side so very nice and soft and pressure relieving on my side yet very comfortable and supportive on my back so very good for her side and back sleepers I also put it about a six and a half out of ten so it's really gonna be a good fit for a lot of different sleepers next finalist is the Brooklyn bedding bloom hybrid mattress I really want to include a tall natural latex hybrid mattress here and that's exactly what you get here got all natural latex on top so if you're worried about kind of chemicals in your mattress it could be a very good option for you so about the same firmness as a lot of the other mattresses on this list about a six and a half out of ten it's also very good for side and back sleepers something very bouncy much bouncer than many of the other mattresses on this list again so it's good for back inside sleepers which is great and if you wanted all natural latex hybrid mattress definitely take a look at this one next up on the list is he tough to needle hybrid mattress this uses their adaptive foam that's in their original mattress mixes in kind of memory foam and latex like qualities it's not gonna sleep hot whatsoever and then you got micro coils and then steel coils so if you want two sets of coils that's definitely what you get here it gives you additional kind of body contouring overall it's also very good for back inside sleeping I found it very good for first side sleeping it's about a six out of ten so there really is a lots like about this mattress to last model this is the purple hybrid premier four inch version I really like this mattress for heavier sleepers especially heavier side sleepers you get a very very pressure relieving four inches of this gel material that collapses and just feels very very nice on your side also has steel support coils it's very very breathable very very durable maybe the most durable on this list there's a ton to like about this mattress hey guys Martin here to offer it up in perspective Joe's five nine one sixty I'm six seven two fifty I'm a larger person joining this list of the best hybrid mattresses now hybrid mattresses are a great option for heavier people because you get the support of coils and the comfort of some type of foam or latex above that but out of these six I think four are a very good match for heavier people like myself so first off we have the casper hybrid mattress now the casper hybrid is really great because of its zone construction and basically that means it's firmer towards the center of the mattress and software towards the top and the bottom of the mattress it makes it a good match for all three sleeping positions even for someone of my size because of the support of coils I'm definitely in the support I need when I'm on my back and my stomach and some extra lumbar support from that zone construction on my side some decent pressure relief on my shoulders and my hips then we have the bloom hybrid which I really like for back sleeping because it has a perfect balance of comfort and support again the support of the clothes beneath that nice comfort layer it allows my hips to sink in some good contouring as well so a very good match for back sleeping then we have the tuft needle hybrid now the tough Neenah hybrid has a very thick comfort layer so when I'm on my side I'm feeling some really good pressure relief on my shoulders through my hips but also moving to my back I'm getting a good overall support some nice contouring and my hip sinking just the right amount then we have finally the purple hybrid premier 4 inch version now this is good for all three sleep musicians but I specifically love it for site sleeping because as a larger side sleeper usually I press through mattresses feel some firmus on my shoulders on my hips when I kind of bottom out on those mattresses this does not happen on the purple Hydra premier 4 inch because I sink into that top gel grid I don't feel any pressure for my shoulders on my hips I feel nice and cocoon and held up almost weightless a bear good match for heavier side sleepers like myself before we close out this video I want me to go over some frequently asked questions about hybrid mattresses our hybrid mattress is any good well they're definitely more breathable more durable more supportive than if you had just kind of foam and sport player so that's definitely something to note there definitely good overall they could also give you the best of both worlds so if you have memory foam you can get all the advantages of memory foam without some of the drawbacks so definitely aren't good mattresses so our hybrid mattress is better than memory foam well it definitely comes down to personal preference I personally think that they are they're more supportive overall I think if you really want to sink into your mattress then just go with a pure memory foam mattress but it really just depends on the kind of feel that you're trying to get I think that they don't trap heat as much so that's very good and I think they're a little bit more durable as well so I personally think that they are better so what is the best hybrid mattress for side sleepers I'll probably take a look at the casper hybrid that's a little bit softer underneath your shoulders because that zone construction is about a 6 out of 10 as well a little bit softer than average also be tough to needle hybrids very good as well definitely did well on our pressure map testing so relieves pressure very well six out of ten a little bit softer than average as well so I'd take a look at those two mattresses alright that's basically it hopefully I've given you a good overview of these mattresses if you're interested in any of these particular mattresses definitely check out the individual reviews we've done it both our website and our YouTube channel and if you're just getting started with your mattress buying journey definitely check out our website consider subscribing to our channel as well once again let me you have any questions [Music]", "hdzXQc9EqcE":

indicate that cost is the biggest barrier to medical marijuana treatment our goal is to help medical marijuana patients afford this safe effective medicine they need today i'm talking about three medical marijuana strains that all have cheese in their names and are all high thc hybrids two indica dominant hybrid strains confidential cheese and blue cheese and a sativa dominant hybrid head cheese we'll talk about their effects and conditions patients find them effective for so let's look at these three cheese medical marijuana strains these strains demonstrate the effects of typical sativa dominant and indica dominant hybrid strains use the links in the description including some free downloads for more detailed information on strain types thc and cbd ratios and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis it is important that medical marijuana patients consider all of these factors when choosing a medical strain to treat their symptoms and that has other effects that they need the strains i discussed today could treat other conditions than just these described these conditions are just what patients have found these strains effective in treating any strain could vary in its effects per individual person due to our unique endocannabinoid systems and medical needs the first two strains are indica dominant hybrid strains that are dominant in calming indica properties blue cheese is an 80 20 indica dominant hybrid 80 percent indica and 20 sativa it is mostly a calming strain with mild uplifting sativa properties blue cheese is relaxing but not sedative typical of many indica dominant hybrid strains it is related to two famous strains blueberry and skunk number one blue cheese has a unique creamy flavor and smell of berry and blue cheese contributing to its name as an indica dominant hybrid it is best used to relieve symptoms during the evening night or at times when you are relaxing cheese has twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbd making this a twenty to one thc to cbd ratio that will produce euphoric effects blue cheese can effectively treat post post-traumatic stress disorder depression pain insomnia stress migraines headaches and inflammation but it is not limited to only treating these conditions blue cheese would benefit anyone who needs improved sleep appetite or mood nighttime relief and body and muscle relaxation the neck strain confidential cheese is another indica dominant hybrid related to other famous strains confidential cheese is a cross of the well-known award-winning strain la confidential and exodus cheese it is a calming strain that produces happy relaxed feelings like many indica dominant hybrid strains confidential cheese has 28 thc and less than 1 cbt with this 28 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphoric effects these may be more intense than other strains with lower percentages of thc as 28 thc is fairly high for a thc percentage of flower strains it will not take a lot to medicate with confidential cheese this strain is best used at night and is a calming strain that provides deep body relaxation and may induce sleep confidential cheese has been noted as effective in treating stress pain inflammation headaches migraines nausea decreased appetite and cramps but it could treat other conditions as well confidential cheese would benefit conditions that need muscle relaxation evening or nighttime relief and improved mood sleep or appetite the last strain head cheese is different than the first two as a sativa dominant hybrid head cheese is a cross of 707 headband and uk cheese it has a unique smell and taste of licorice and peppermint as a sativa dominant hybrid head cheese is dominantly energizing and uplifting with some calming properties patients report that head cheese produces a clear alert head with full body relaxation and is a good combination of uplifting energizing sativa qualities and relaxing indica qualities it relieves symptoms while allowing you to be active and focused head cheese has 26 percent thc and less than 1 cbd with this 26 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphuria it is best utilized for daytime relief of symptoms when you are active patients have found success in treating decreased appetite nausea anxiety stress muscle spasms pain headaches and migraines with head cheese but it could certainly treat other conditions as well head cheese would benefit anyone who needs body relaxation with a clear head in focus daytime relief energy and improved mood or appetite these strains demonstrate what is typical of many indica dominant and sativa dominant hybrid strains it is always important to look at the individuality of strains in their unique cannabinoid interpreting profiles

everyone it's Abdallah here bringing you guys another tips and tricks tutorial video for Animal Crossing New Horizons today's video is showing you guys everything you need to know about all of the different hybrid breeds within the game across all the eight species of flowers by the end of this video you guys are going to be hybrid experts now I love planting I love the gold flowers in the game it's just so much fun for me so thanks so much for being here and of course if you guys didn't already see our previous hybrid guide where we showed you guys the basics of how to make hybrids got over 4,000 likes you guys are absolutely insane and then right over here the gold rose video that I made not too long ago got over 3,000 likes so if we get a fraction that holy moly you guys are awesome alright so without further ado let's become hybrid experts how this video is going to be divided is going to be in three parts I'm going to give you guys the basic rundown right at the beginning we're gonna go over all of the recipes for every single one of the 20-plus hybrids in the game and then at the very end I'm gonna give you guys a little tips and trick on how to water your plants way easier so stick around alright so here we go hybrids hybrids hybrids where do we even start right where do we even start so you're gonna start by going over to the nooks area right the Nook shop and then you're gonna go raid their cupboard or if you really want to start without buying any of the packets just go across your area your entire town and take a look at what you have that's natively growing every town has a different native plant and a different availability when it comes to roses in the cupboard over here so definitely take a look and see what you have I had a code three natives that were in my town and then when I expanded shop I was able to get some roses that show up over here so everyone's town is going to be different as far as what colors are going to be available here so if you want you can grab like a Rose bag like this you can buy them I would say buy as many as you want roses are a little bit more lucrative when it comes to breeding because at the time recording they're the only gold flower in the game so here's hoping that they expand on that I really want them to that would be amazing alright now that we've got our flowers in hand whether or not you've bought them from the store or pick them up off the ground it doesn't matter the end result is going to be exact same thing you are definitely not going to have a difference between the two so keep that in mind all right now that you have them in hand all you have to do is put them in a kind of checker pattern however you want now based off of which recipes you're one of you're going to follow is you're going to have to pay attention to which flowers are next to each other now I say next to each other meaning in a diagonal cross pattern if you use the diagonal cross patterns you're going to have a higher optimization for different empty spaces simply around the flowers that they can spawn some new buds with so what I've got going on over here is just uh it's it looks like a mess but it's a calculated mess of what exactly I want roses to grow out of here so we've got some lines of yellows whites and reds and of course when I'm trying to make black flowers I've got a whole bunch of reds over here to remember we're gonna show you guys all the recipes so don't you worry about it so it's gonna be super easy I've got this white one in my pocket over here you're gonna grab the white one you're gonna press the a button you're gonna press plant and then boom you've got a little sprout over here now you don't necessarily have to water your sprout because over time after a couple days the sprouts are going to turn into buds and then they're going to flower so don't even worry about watering them watering them is really only when you want the different flowers to make any kind of offspring or do some crossbreeding so for example right over here if I'm looking for black roses I'm gonna water every single one of these red roses in hopes that tomorrow on a brand-new day that a little black rose bud will actually show up over here it's going to be pretty cool and that's the fun part about this game it's like seeing what exactly is going to happen so if you're gonna take anything out of it just make sure that you do cross patterns and then you just make an entire farm for any kinds of flowers any kind of breeds as you want and then go from there alright so that's the basics that's all you really need to know whatever kinds you have available just make them into cross patterns and then maybe you'll be lucky enough that they can breed into some different colors no look I got some growing over there kind of cool and of course you're going to be able to get lots of different bugs that fly on them too especially if they're hybrids you get some really cool butterflies that come on the hybrids alright so let's take a a left pestis robot over here and let's start off with roses as you guys can see roses are the most lucrative for me simply because the end result of black roses is going to be the gold rose and that is going to be something that I've already grown about nine of them just by watering black roses so let's go and we're gonna talk about it look at these black roses they're everywhere alright so right over here this is the basic recipe these are the basic colors too you have red white and yellow and from red white and yellow you can get every single one of the breeds that are above me on screen over here so if you add a red and a white together you can get a pink one now a pink one is what I consider a trophy color meaning after you're done breeding a pink one it's really just for show you're not going to be using pink ones for any other additional color breeding it's a trophy you can put Pink's next to each other and they can possibly give you some more Pink's but that's just about it the well runs dry with that one so keep that in mind next up is going to be red and yellow ready yellow make a very awesome orange color and you're going to need some oranges for some other colors a little bit later I'll show you guys next up over here is the Reds so you put any two Reds next to each other and you water them and you'll be able to get a black which is really good and black is going to do the recipe for the gold ones very soon all right hold on pause sorry I need this totally neat it don't even talk to me about it I'm trying to get my gold sling shot alright next next right over here is two whites if you put two whites together you can indeed make a purple rose whoa super cool all right you guys can see over here that this one is going to be pretty interesting because these next to each other a white and an orange if you get a whiten and an orange together you're going to be able to make a special red now this red looks exactly like the other ones they do but this special red will be the one that gives you the ability to get blue ones and that's why I put the Abdallah face right over here because you're going to need two special Reds in order to make a blue now taking this on full value if you looked at this picture that is completely incorrect you need to make sure that you're putting your white ones next to your orange ones and then if you do see a red sprout you want to take that red one and then segregate it from all the other red ones because the only way that you're gonna get blue in the game is if you put two of those special Reds two together all right and then last but not least if you have access to a gold watering can be it training from someone or having a five-star town come on over here and water your black roses if you water your black rose the next day it has a random chance of spawning a golden bud and that's it so you don't need two black roses next to each other you don't need anything like that just water some black ones and then there's a random chance that it'll show a gold one so pretty cool I like the golden a lot all right so that's roses for you let's move on to the next breed of flower as you guys can see a little sneak peak over here this is gonna be hyacinths so you guys can see whether or not you want to invest in them because I've got all the colors available for you so basic colors are exactly like roses you got red white yellow moving on over here adding the red and white together equals a very cool-looking pink adding the red and yellow together makes it very cool looking orange putting two whites next to each other makes a blue one and if you had a couple hybrid oranges floating around you slap the two oranges together and you'll be able to get a purple pretty cool right I think the purple one looks cool and I like the blue one a lot like I really do all right next up is tulips tulips one of my first breeding projects because that was one of my native flowers and I made a purple one it was cool you'll see it in my first hybrid video anyway same concept it's gonna be red white yellow so once you see red white yellow put red White's together and you'll be able to make a pink tulip very nice put your red and yellow together you'll be able to make a very sleek looking orange one super fun and like some other recipes if you put two Reds together you'll be able to make the black one and you can see like the little yellow aesthetics on the inside of the flower too and of course like our previous one if you have two oranges which is a lot of breeding you put your two oranges together you guys will make the purple ones which is probably the rarest out of all of them so keep trying you'll get it alright next family is going to be the lilies you can see over here lilies are going to be the exact same thing red white yellow is what you start off with you put your red and white together and you guys can make a pink one very nice you put your red and yellow together to make an orange one and you slept two Reds together and you guys can indeed make a black one moving on to the Kosmos Kosmos are over here they kind of look like daisies a little bit so it's gonna be the same colored patterns red white yellow and a lot of them are going to be the exact same thing adding the red and white together will make you a pink one adding the red and yellow one together will make you an orange one and slapping the two orange ones together it will make you a black one alright so next up we have the very awesome pansies now just like the roses pansies are going to be a little bit harder to get all the colors simply because there is a purebred recipe on board too so you want to take a look at that so your basic colors are going to be red white yellow even though it looks like a black and kind of looks like a purple and whatever that's the colors of them red white yellow so you come on board over here red and white equals an orange so you can see that with these pansies over here the little orange like kind of crown within there that's the orange coloration of it so keep that in mind so next up is two White's equals a blue one very very interesting and then you've got some very special ones over here with the pansies and I mark them with the Abdallah faces because these are going to be your Lear very interesting purebred ones in order to get yourself the purple pansies now right on board if you throw a red one next to a blue one you can get a special red one and that's what we call a like a a purebred red one it's completely special because these two sprouted it but it looks the exact same next up another way of getting another special purebred is going to put the orange ones and the blue ones together and by doing that you can indeed get a special orange one now for the purple one if you do have two of these special red ones or two of the special orange ones and you put those next to each other they can indeed cross pollinate in order to get the purple one so again this one's a little bit harder and it's harder to get the end result because there's a lot of a lot of specific breeding that you're going to do in order to get that done okay wind flowers I do like the wind flowers a lot the basic colorations are going to be red white and foreign JH so keep that in mind if you slap a red and white one together you can getting a pretty pink one love it slap two white ones together and you get a blue one and then this one's pretty rare if you get two of the blue ones together you will absolutely have a chance of getting a purple one so the purple one is gonna be the top tier as far as the rarity of those go and last but not least we do have the mums the only green hybrid in the game go figure so it's going to be red white yellow which are the basic colors head on over red plus white equals e very pretty in pink you got the white plus white equals the purples and you slap two Purple's together you can get the elusive green mums whoa that's pretty cool okay so ladies and gents that's all the recipes for Animal Crossing new horizons every single hybrid within the game I counted over 25 of them so here's hoping that maybe in the future we can get a flower update okay so we got one more thing to do now there's a lot of a lot of things that you can do in order to water all these right you can make you can make little rows of stuff you can make the little checkered pattern like I've done right over here like I've got this little cross pattern that I'm really just gonna gold watering can every single one of these but watering flowers takes a long time you can see this here if you have the regular watering can you only water about six spaces every time you do it and if you have the golden water and can if you're fortunate enough you can water nine spaces but what if I told you there's a way faster way all right follow me on this one so we have all these hybrids here right they're all hair and I'm really hoping that we can actually make something happen so why don't we do this take about a cake a slider and I'll show you this is an approach used for people with a more customized gameplay experience if you guys play the game from day to day without messing around with customizing your time then this method is definitely not going to help you but it's going to help the rest of the people that play more customized why so anyway so we're gonna do is we are going to close our software over here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to adjust my date too time that I had rain oh man picking up what I'm putting down over here so I knew that I had rain exactly right over here at about 8:20 a.m. on 5-8 and this will work for you guys a hundred percent of the time I'm not sure if my specific date will work for you but if you notice that it's raining in your game definitely jot down that time and date on a piece of paper in case you want to customize your gameplay experience so that you guys can go get that rain and if you guys are like me then you want as many hybrid flowers as possible especially because they have a very high value in the stock market and you guys can easily beautify your town in ways that other people can't simply by putting in the time of watering and crossbreeding and taking a look at all that fun stuff so we went so we're gonna we're gonna go back to when I had rain which was not too long ago according to in this game and we're just going to load up our file so usually whenever you click on the load button and it's a brand-new day the loading screen does take a little bit so don't even worry about it ok so as you guys can see we do have rain over a year this isn't edited this isn't a justed by any means this is me showing you exactly what's going on now remember I showed you all of my black flowers and the very bottom over there so those are gonna get watered they're not gonna get watered with gold rain but all the flowers on top of my island which is all the way up north and my rosebuds those guys are gonna get a whole bunch of water too so as you guys can see every single flower in my town has now been watered in less than like 2 minutes so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to save the game and then what happens is that the game saves saying that oh hey today every single one of your plants is water so what we're going to do now is once it says you're ready to go we are going to close out Animal Crossing and then we're gonna go back to the day that we just were now customizing your time in order to go back in time doesn't really do anything to your game it's not going to hurt your game it's not gonna harm anything it's just going to pretend that it's a brand new day so things that you can miss out on potentially is your login bonuses on your abd you can miss out on that if you didn't run and go take a look at it you're gonna miss out on any items that the Timmy and Tommy's shop have but other than that the game thinks it's just hey you know here's a brand new day you might not get the morning announcements because you've already loaded them once but at the same time I got all my flowers watered and I'm able to go check them all out dig up any hybrids that came out and then just keep on going so you can see that this process over here of mass mass watering your plants is going to be a hybrid gardeners best friend so I'm excited to actually go all the way up on top and see what kind of flowers we got so anyway let's load up this game one more time and I'll show you guys everything you need to know and then maybe you know all the recipes that we have just spread out in front of the town hall maybe some of those made some hybrids who knows all right I'm looking I'm looking oh hey look at that morning announcements excellent ok nothing happening that's kind of what I'm noticing here too the more you play this game the less happens and then Isabel just keeps on repeating her lines over and over and over again oh you got a new magazine cool you got a crossword puzzle cool it said how do your mom and dad and didn't you mention a thing about Digby alright anyway so we can see here that my buds came on board so I got the gold roses over here this is what I put inside the little Tommy a new from Timmy Noakes payments or 500 bells all thanks guys not skipping out on any of that stuff so as you can see over here these all of these got watered simply because of the rain but I didn't water them with gold so whatever not a big deal so I've got two little black buds that are over here which is great and we got another black bud so I can expand my entire black flowers over here you can take a look if you have your shovel available these two guys just bread which was awesome and that's exactly showing you what exactly we got so since I got that out of there we got orange roses just from the red and yellow is just by doing that it's so fun come on on over here these guys just gave us a little red so this is another purebred red that we just dug out so this is red rosebuds very nice coming on over here Oh check this out two White's together I mean I don't necessarily need the white so that's kind of a dud that's a bit of a mess if you think about it anything else anything else any other breeds oh look at this two Reds just made a black oh so cool alright beautifully done so you can see over here that we do have the black tulip buds so two Reds making the black very nice what else we got over here anyone else anyone else making making some rose babies right over here so these guys made some oh whoa yeah that's the Abdallah face one oh ok so remember red pansy buds so these remember these are like the Pawar's ones the hybrids so I just made a hybrid one so that's gonna be one of these guys in order to make the the purple ones so it's really cool that we got one of those and then moving on over here I don't know if we got any mums no we did not so let's see it on a bigger scale and you guys are gonna do this too so clear out your entire areas oh this one just randomly got a bud I mean I'm not even worrying about that right now so let's see it on a grander scale from everything on my spots up here so let's show you guys let's walk on up let's walk on up over here and I'll show you guys the roses now I'm not really paying attention to the mums but I'm paying oh my gosh what in the world is that give me that I must be Wow holy moly Queen Alexandra's bird wing that looks awesome alright anyway wrong tutorial anyway so any kind of buds are the ones that we produce yesterday technically um so looking over here we got a white bud pretty interesting oh whoa cool cool check this out we can take up all these guys yo so these whites next to each other or some one of these probably Pink's let's take a look so that was yeah that's pink rose so you can see that the only thing that could breed over there would be you know Pink's or oranges so we got Pink's they're right over here we got some Reds that were just gonna be digging up this over here is probably orange it looks like yellow though so let's see yeah it looks like yellow not too bad right over here it looks like we got another red it's okay yeah we got another red right over this way we did get a yellow don't really need that and then I'm looking for blacks oh we didn't get any black unfortunately but as you guys can see as long as you're keeping the cross pattern your ring you're going to net so many different flowers in the game and if you want to really expand your entire island with all sorts of cross patterns by all means do it oh these guys bloomed I didn't realize pink flowers okay cool anyway guys that's really all I got

your boy Bob Marley man - master pom has pledged to blue dream I'm out", "23uuB-9gsyA": "what's up fish - beer - Bob once again just coming back at you with another tank this is on my three with a sump system that I've got over here and we're just going to talk quick about these guys that are in here so in this tank I've got a steak endler Colony that I got for their starter with a pair from Lukas Brett's hell RB aquatics calm throw out there shout out and these guys it took a long time for him to really start producing anything over the last two maybe three or four months I'm not sure of the timeline but we started getting some some good a good amount of babies out of this out of this tank so there's some of the young ones up there there's some males that colored up this one's just starting to get good color on them same thing with that other one next to them there's one super nice male there he is the spots mystique from what I can understand from reading stuff online or whatever refers to the spotting on them it's you know a foreign language or something I'm not sure but you know you could look it up probably show that before I did this plant wise we've got the same I threw a little chunk of horn Warren in here just kind of like I did in this tank here and I just kind of took over and pushed out so it's sucking up some nitrates I like that about it it's got a couple of nice bronze crypts to see this one it's floating so looks like the roots kind of melted away I'll have to shove that back down there and see what's going on there it looks like I can actually split this one up into a couple of different pieces now so maybe that's what it's doing is trying to find a new home that doesn't like oops sorry isn't like where it's at we've got some alter in theory Nikki I variation cardinalis these ones they were all kind of clumped together over here and we're getting shaded out by this christmas moss that just grows like weeds in these tanks and so they kind of die back so I split them up into individual stems where you planted them added some root tabs and some liquid fertilizer into these tanks just to try to get it jump-started again kind of the same thing over aside here little stems everywhere when I got it I got it from Petsmart as a tissue culture they have like the top ten variety they're you know bagged up already ready to go all you gotta do is buy them and put them in your tanks and of all the plants that I've gotten from fish stories this one did the best until I stopped fertilizing like I was it really does like a good dose of fertilizer I think all of these er plants do and if you don't keep up on that then you know you're gonna pay the price same thing with lighting if you don't have a high enough light they're gonna pay for it this one's just a beams work da full-spectrum 10,000 K and it's got the blue in there and it's got you know you can kind of see that red in the green and lots of white LEDs and that's pretty much what I have across the fish room on all of these tanks is all beams work LED lights and they work really good for growing plants and for lighting the aquarium's so I just run with that otherwise I was talking about the the moss in there that Christmas Moss they're this big chunk it took over the entire back end of this aquarium I had to kind of like every once in a while I'll just get in there and just mash it down to the bottom again and because the bottom where it's shaded will just die out and they'll just kind of slowly fall apart but the tops will keep growing like like big bushes here so every once in a while to get in and you kind of mad everything down it's gonna make some some mold and stuff underneath there which is it's good for the fish in the shrimp as far as I'm concerned so let's see what else oh well the big thing in here is these this blue dream colony again the blue dreams I got last year sometime I got 10 of them only like six of them made it if I remember correctly and they were supposed to be straight-up blue dreams I don't know if you can see the colors on that one swimming away right now there's some around and if you look around it closely you'll see some that have red Superman type heads like there's one two three of them right there there's one right in the center of the frame that red down there and for a while I was thinking there was something wrong with them some kind of a molting issue or a type of bacteria they can get in there but I've had a few generations of these and I have another tank I'll kind of show you that another time here and they they seem to keep reproducing so I don't think there's anything wrong with them they live to be full-sized adults and then have lots of babies and those babies kind of have those red spots too or brown so it is what it is so this blue dream colony produced quite a bit that you can still see that I mean there's there's probably you know a couple hundred or so I'm kind of guesstimating living in this tank this moss really does help hide them the big female sneak and lair she will actively hunt I've watched her so she'll actively go out and hunt the baby shrimp and pick them off one by one and to me that's okay a little bit of population control plus she's getting some needed protein and roughage and stuff to do her diet which in turn is giving me some more sneak and learn babies which was kind of a the point of of these of these tanks you know they have two different types of animals living the same tank both producing offspring kind of a breeding for-profit type thing in a little 10 gallon tank of course in here we've got all of the duckweed again I do scoop these regularly and I'll kind of show you I so I'll take the duckweed out I'll put it on on something and I'll kind of dry it out and it kind of makes a really good fish food you got to get a lot of it in order to make it worthwhile and you got to make sure it dries rather quickly you don't want to let let it sit around and kind of a lot for a few days so get it spread out on like some kind of paper or a sheet pan from the kitchen or something like that dried out really good and then I've may have been making this homemade fish food that I kind of keyed to everybody and I add spirulina and a couple other things to it to make it to make it worthwhile oh yeah so anyway duckweed blah blah blah again this one's on the automatic system here too or the sump system where the water comes in flows through the back drips down to the bottom back into this tank and then it goes through a mat and filter back to a pump and then pops back up to this tank here let's see I wonder what else I want to say there is something else I was going to talk to talk to you about on this tank too but I can't really think of it again I feed this tank pretty heavily same thing as the other ones baby brine shrimp when they hatch frozen foods lots of different types of flake and the shrimp for the most part gets I like the shrimp dinner you get my homemade food they get some bacteria small doses toss the spoon that comes with it and I use this little tiny spoon and I'll only use about a third of this spoon in my 10 gallon tanks once or twice a week again more more of this tetraman tropical tablets I also got some awesome food from Dan quad X I want a little giveaway he had on Facebook so these are bombs they're something and you can kind of see the ingredients on there you can definitely tell that it's got the soy stuff in there too is when I feed snow flake or snow pops or whatever shrimpking does you can see it kind of flakes apart into pieces and no one shrimp can just take it and just dominate it or anything like that so but you know we got some shrimp dinner some mineral junkie I do feed you know bees and some other random stuff in there too into their diet lots of wafers that kind of stuff so they kind of get a varied mix of foods and they seem to do well on it so I'm not going to spoil it by trying to change into food up I also use food Loki's ultra supple and all the shrimp just go nuts for it as soon as it hits the water they're on it so once in a while I'm out of here right now but once in a while we throw that in there and him a little supplement and I think that's pretty much it like I said I have another tank with a lot of the coals so whenever I find a red one I pull them out I stick them into another little five and a half gallon tank that I have and that's where I'm keeping all of the Superman shrimp at so I guess that's it until next time make sure you give my videos a little thumbs up hit the subscribe button all that jazz and we'll catch you on the next one peace", "XfkrCNYST7A": "I know that they wanna do all this [ __ ] I've been doing but they cannot do it I went to my city my gang rolling with me no time to stop we keep what's good YouTube it's your man the guns a gun guns our vape here once again with a new video but I know you lovely people already new vets today we're taking a step away from the smart cards and we're taking a step away from the dispensaries we're also taking a step away from the dank vapes but we are touching on something that is near and dear and also a favorite of mine and that is brass knuckles this one here is blue dream I got to say I love the iridescent on the brass knuckles logo down there as you can see it is a sativa so it is for the uppers and the active doers still got the protectors on there because that's how I like to bring it to y'all unfortunately since it is a brass knuckles I cannot give you any numbers that is the one thing I wish that they would actually include with these but I'm excited on two levels I'm gonna go see endgame again for the second time again for the second time again for the second time and I got a new brass knuckles and it's been a while since I've had a brass knuckles on this channel too but we are here with a brass knuckles let's get it out the case and there you go the reason why it looks like it's a little missing it's probably because I've had this cart sitting and it's been at an angle so I'm pretty sure some of it went up into the mouthpiece probably drift a little bit but this is a Graham it's a little under now but you know check around and uh got the rubber to and it has the official brass knuckles similar there but oh yeah without further ado we're gonna do a last honorary of this dank vape cuz it's still going a little strong Cheers now this wants to give me a problem honestly I got to say after having some dang vapes I'm not really a fan of him the two reasons one I feel they might have pests lungs felt a little funny today and it's mainly because I had stopped the dang and went to my crumble but I don't know maybe that was just the two different weeds fighting in my lungs I don't know but it felt a little not nice I was just say that - I don't like them because they have this plastic casing this is actually plastic don't let it fool you like they may you both look similarly glass but don't get it twisted this is plastic and this is actually glass because I know because I've repeatedly tried to break one of these by forcibly slamming it to the ground to no avail - where I had to go get pliers and actually crush it and realize hey glass doesn't shatter like this only plastic does also I realized this is the only vape this specific one is the only one that's given me problems where I have to constantly readjust it and fix it just for the cash and see why there wasn't working I literally just span it and it works now also this bake has been giving me problems error messages flashing lights on my vapes and I've used three different beeps batteries but that's enough about me jaw-jacking about old feets y'all not here for that y'all here for some new [ __ ] this [ __ ] Cheers oh wow so I forgot that they put mouthpieces on these but they hit me with a double whammy check this out look how small this mouthpiece is do and this was literally in the hole don't say him like okay it's clogged I'm thinking his clogged because of what I said with the oil leaking his club because of this little [ __ ] sorry about that Cheers hmm first rip that one was scrumptious it was just delicious it was thick it actually felt like I had something I'm something like gum in my mouth I like thick things like that because one I feel like they're more potent scuse me [ __ ] oh yeah this is gonna hit hard especially in the movie theaters listen I wanted wrasse knuckles for the longest because out of all the vapes I've had this is the most consistent when I've had all the other [ __ ] I've had smartcards King King pounds also consistent to a smart car is dank beige the off-white vapes I had on this channel [ __ ] even some of the truly vapes I had the vapes so people don't get it mixed up with anything else but yeah brass knuckles are the most consistent in one of them and actually some of the most powerful I've had you can even see that the the vapor that is producing is like clear like smooth white like actual [ __ ] smoke and I love it because that's the quality man quality I'm already feeling this blue dream and it is a dream it's coming on nice and slow and it's like a little slight warming sensation from head to shoulders that might go down more the throat burn is real throat is on fire as I said you know you know so Steve is for the upper so it'll get you active I just need this to help my brain look for [ __ ] I didn't see in and knife in your endgame the first time around also let me know down in the comment section below if you would like to see an end game review obviously it's gonna have spoilers it's a three hour movie who wants to look at a review of a movie that's three hours long and then wants to keep the spoilers hidden I asked you who it just doesn't make sense but just like I did my Brody with you it has spoilers like I said let me know in the comments if you want endgame with you and I'll be more than happy to put it out there for you I'm might starting to gaming up a little bit right now only have one episode and that's just for killing dragon ball legends supersonic warriors 2 for the Nintendo DS just let me know if y'all want to see that I don't really think Gaiman would what's the word I don't really think Gaiman would stick with some of you because it's a vaping channel you know it's it's about vaping and then I have a friend that's like Oh put your gaming videos on your vaping Channel and then I'm like that's like putting my vaping channels on my gaming my vaping videos on my gaming channel you know that just doesn't make sense well as I said it like that doesn't make sense so the vapors come to the vaping channel for the vaping videos and the gamers go to the gaming channel for the gaming videos the only reason why I put the a pics video over on my vaping Channel is that was the first one that the game first win of the day in the first game of the day and that win was so clutch they almost had me they really almost had me but I don't want to take up too much time for this video this brass knuckles blue dream has been a dream I'm loving it I would give it a I'll give it a 7 it's not too strong then again I do have a high tolerance then again like I said I have a high tolerance so it might even take a while for it to really kick in but y'all been with me the whole time here no cuts no nothing hitting it down excuse me my throat is regretting that entire rip but as I've said I don't want to take up too much more your time thank you all for tuning in it's killing you right now thank you all for tuning in don't forget to hit that sub button and that notification bail because it's just rude to do one without the other they're just like brothers and don't forget to leave me down a comment below if you have also tried blue dream and what are your thoughts on that what would you rate it i rated a 7 honestly i don't really see it moving to a 8 I just don't but it does have the brass knuckle backing it so if you say eight it's an eight but for me I say it's a seven and see now starting the onset now we're starting the onset so [ __ ] it ganja bait says it's an eight just because it's a brass knuckles anyway thanks everyone for tuning in have a great day [Music] stay hey guys [ __ ] is a good thing I'd got that out [ __ ] later", "tRH17XPVXK4": "hey how's it going this is owen you are watching the slumber yard and we have a mattress comparison for you today we're going to be taking a look at the dream cloud mattress versus the dream cloud premiere now as a brand dream cloud only used to offer one mattress it was called just the dream cloud and that is now the dream cloud premiere then they introduce the new dream cloud as their standard more affordable flagship mattress that might sound a little bit confusing but don't worry we're just going to go over how these beds are similar how they're different and why you might want to get one mattress over the other we hope we shed some light on these beds for today if we do give us a thumbs up we'd really appreciate that subscribe to the channel to keep up to date on all these online beds and be sure to check down below in the description we have a ton of content down there to help you with your mattress search our full written reviews of these beds best lists other comparisons and any discounts we can find will be down there as well anyway let's get to it so you want a new mattress [Music] and make sure you're cashing in on the greatest appeal with so many events online all right let's kick this video off by just quickly going over all the company policy information should you decide to get one of these bets stuff like shipping returns trial periods and warranties and that's going to be pretty easy to do because since they're from the same company they're going to be the exact same and just so you know even though dream cloud sent us these beds for free to review should you decide to get one for yourself your experience is going to be basically the same they ship to you totally free inside of a box you just drag it inside rip off all the plastic and you have a brand new mattress these beds are a bit heavier so if you struggle to lift things you might want a friend there to help you out but it's a pretty quick and easy process once the bed arrives you get 365 nights so an entire year to try out the bed in the comfort of your own home to decide if it's really the mattress for you if for whatever reason it's not you can get totally free returns within that first year but should you decide to keep it they back their beds with a lifetime warranty so that's all the policy stuff dream cloud does go quite a bit beyond the standard mattress policies for their trial period and their warranty which is pretty cool so let's get into how these beds are similar now aside from their policies and the first and biggest thing is that they're both hybrid coil beds a lot of online beds use foam for their support base but dream cloud opts for pocketed coils in both of their beds we've talked about pocketed coils ad nauseum here at the slumber yard we'll have some additional information about them linked in the description but the long story short is that they give you a similar level of support and balance as old-school inner springs do but they behave more independently of each other so you have less cross-mattress motion having coils is going to make both beds a pretty good option for heavier people somewhere in the 250-pound range because they're going to offer more long-term support and durability over the course of several years and some people myself included just prefer the extra bounce you get with a coil bed another thing these beds have in common is that their covers are really soft and luxurious and even feature a bit of cashmere woven in since you're going to put sheets on them it's not that important of a feature but since we live in breathe beds over here we appreciate little details like that let's get into how these beds are different now starting with probably the biggest difference which is their respective firmness levels the dream cloud premiere is going to be a bit firmer than dream cloud we have the dream cloud mattress at a flat medium on our firmness scale which means no matter how you like to sleep back stomach site or combination you should be able to get by pretty well on this bed a lot of brands flagship mattresses hover around a medium that makes a lot of sense because they're trying to appeal to the widest variety of sleepers out there and not really alienate anyone the dream cloud premiere on the other hand isn't that much firmer than the dream cloud but it is pretty noticeable we have it somewhere between a medium and a medium firm which is going to make it more ideal for strict back and stomach sleepers while the dream cloud will be more ideal for strict side sleepers keep in mind that firmness is pretty subjective based on your weight i'm a bigger dude so i generally feel beds to be a bit softer but if you're significantly lighter than me you'll probably feel them to be a bit firmer but the bottom line is if you want a softer mattress go with dream cloud if you want a firmer mattress go with dream cloud premiere there is also a very subtle difference in feel between these two beds memory foam is the primary comfort layer in the dream cloud and the dream cloud premiere so when you lay down on them you will get a bit of that sinking sensation and it will conform to your body's shape neither has that classic dense tempur-pedic type memory foam feel the memory foam inside is a bit more responsive and since they both have those quilted covers i mentioned it balances out the memory foam feel nicely but since the dream code premiere just has more memory foam you're gonna have more of a memory foam feel with that mattress i think fans of memory foam and even people who don't like memory foam that much will find both beds be pretty comfortable but if you're specifically seeking out a memory foam bed then dream cloud premiere is probably your better option before we start talking about the pricing of both of these beds let's take a quick break to cover our monthly mattress giveaway if you want to know how you can win a brand new queen size bed check all the information down below in the description it's surprisingly quick and easy to enter we give away a brand new queen size bed every single month so best luck to you there now let's talk about price which is going to be another pretty big difference between the dream cloud and the dream cloud premiere the flagship dream cloud mattress has an msrp of about 1100 bucks for a queen size which is actually a very affordable price for a hybrid coil mattress the dreamcloud premiere on the other hand is 1400 for queen size dreamcloud historically has been pretty consistent with their discounts we should have something linked for you down below in the description to knock 200 off the price tag of each which honestly makes them pretty darn affordable options pricing and discounts do change all the time in the online mattress industry so just be sure to check down below in the description for current pricing and offers dream cloud does sometimes even do bundle deals but the bottom line is you'll be saving about 300 bucks going with the standard flagship dream cloud and that's pretty much it when it comes to these two beds they're both really solid memory foam hybrid options that we think a lot of sleepers out there are really gonna like someone on our team actually sleeps on dream cloud premiere but i'd say go with the standard dream cloud if you want the softer more neutral feeling and more affordable option of the two and go with dream club premiere if you want the firmer bed and the one that has more of a memory foam feel i don't really think you can go wrong with either option we really like dreamcloud as a brand and since you have an entire year to try out either bed there's really no risk to you which is one of the big perks of buying a bed online anyways guys i hope this video was helpful for you if it was give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the slumber yard we appreciate that a lot be sure to check out all that great content i mentioned for you down below in the description and as always sleep right sleep tight and we'll see you next time [Applause] [Music]

here but um you know that kind of adds its own character and this is pretty neutral but good sounding amp alright thanks for tuning in JDM pedals review here we've got the illustrious stefan hendrix helping us out today so that i can twist knobs while he plays the guitar he's gonna play a little bit of rhythm stuff in a and then we're gonna flip on the pedal and go from there so give us a little rhythm there stefan with the dream unlike a usual - screamer this one's based more on st-9 rather rare version that has adjustable control all the way down your - typical tube screamer kind of sounds so kind of without Dennis behind the st-9 the tone controls the passive tone control so generally it only cuts your not boosting sigh here is the dream dream switch the dream and scream result and dream mode you're gonna get a lot more transparency I'm still getting that fullness alright thanks Stefan so and a quick and easy review here we've gone through the features we've got our gain which is gonna give you about double as much gain when you're in the screen mode as opposed to the dream mode dream is great for rhythm stuff scream of course for leads we've got adjustable base mids and treble it is a passive tone control which kind of gives you the purest smoothest kind of sound so generally speaking you'll start with it all the way up and then adjust back if your pickups are a little bright alright and then a volume with the volume of course you can even just drive your amplifier let's try that stuff on play a little bit more lead stuff for me we've got a lot of volume on tap fire I'm offering in the distance all right thanks for tuning in thanks for checking out this pedal is available at Joe doc music.com on the JDM pedals and there's a link below the video thanks for tuning in and special thanks to Stefan for ripping up the guitar for us today", "cV4MePvjY44": "I'm phone number hey YouTube how is everybody this evening so I decided to do a review of Blue Dream this evening which is kind of a little bit odd because it is a majority of a sativa but we are gonna check it out first I am going to share the stream so give me just a moment and I will be right with you thank you one kisses thank you no I get one kiss the snap you're gonna knock stuff over stop I said stop you've mister boland to try and fall on a sweater sorry no judo you got share it otherwise

something here in the way I'm just gonna come back sorry I will get this handy Holloway yeah yeah my accent will start coming out slightly you okay so tonight we are looking at blue dream which is a 60/40 sativa dominant strain so we're gonna go ahead and read a little bit about it so blue dream is a slight is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid it's a 60/40 indica strain that is potent cross between a hugely popular blueberry exhales strains this it's actually blueberry and a sativa haze that it is cross twist which is a really good - really good strains this infamous bud boasts a moderately high THC level it ranges from 17 to 24 percent on average and a myriad of both indica and sativa effects that's why we're doing this evening because this one does help me sleep a little bit I will do a full indica later on towards my time in order to get me help so users describe the blue dream high as having an immense onset of uplifting cerebro head high that leaves you completely motivated and focused with waves of creative energy that hit quick and hard this is accompanied by mellow relaxing new body highs that leaves you warmed numb and completely pain free do to those potent combination effects Lou dream is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress chronic pain due to injury or illness mild to moderate cases of depression which we can all use these days and sleep disorders including insomnia Blue Dream has a delicious aroma sweet blueberry pie and a taste of sugary sweet blueberries it stays on your tongue long after smoking this bud has large dense yet fluffy popcorn shaped bright neon green nodes with amber and blue hairs rich blue undertones these nuts are dusted with a fine layer of sandy looking white trichomes and sweet sticky resin that sounds yummy so the effects of this are going to be creative energizing euphoria and happy to relieve the symptoms of a DV ADHD and anxiety bipolar

plastic sheeting that's why I love these sheets so well is because you can no you can just you don't have to open them to see so you we can all see that they're still having a humidity factor at the processing plant so it's coming out the shatter is coming out like a sugary wax dry consistency which is perfectly fine slopes excuse me what let's see how she tastes oh [ __ ] this guy's bumper dad

painful or anything you can just it's bare oh you have the crumble yeah um do you have do you feel like it hits you hard in the chest if you do like a larger dab out of your crumble because that's what I kind of I'm getting right now it's like if it gives you this heavy chest big papa good up you play you're known to the camera about people at your family cool so I can now feel it start to come or relax down my body if it wasn't for the Blue Dream I wouldn't be able to sleep last night I you know right because we used to cue and it's funny because it sense but what it says that it is a 60-40 sativa but he does it really gives you that couch lock to help you sleep at night um so yeah it really does I do like that part of this yeah makes you feel like you're gonna elephant on your chest it's really heavy it doesn't long so like might have gone now um so I don't feel like okay you breathe but at first it does didn't you kind of feel it like pour down the rest of your body at me but it does it just kind of relaxes down I'm sorry yeah I've had that last couple of nights I ended up getting really depressed last week because I went to see my regular doctor the doctor I was in for probably the last five years you know I really like something I've never had problem with him but because of everything that went on in the hospital he was actually really mean to me and he's never been mean to me before and he was like no you were in the hospital because you know the admitting paperwork was talking about my gallbladder well I don't think it was to the next thing but it was a after event a surgeon calls me for a gallbladder and says okay we're setting up for surgery so now I have surgery the week of the 19th that very next week and then the week of October 3rd because I'm going to go in and do the surgery I can't see doing my gallbladder so I thought that was kind of you know weird that the doctor at the hospital when she discharged me light on on the paperwork thing they I was able to go home because the only problem was I was constipated and that wasn't even the problem so I talked to a hospital and I made a formal complaint and then I I said the lady told me the records lady she told me she's like what I want you to do is relieve spot right here we want you to pick up the actual scans and take those to your doctor with you because she was like she did want to tell me that the records had been tampered with so I was like oh my god I didn't think anything I've had doctors seem to be getting that way lately my doctor I've seen eight years old last month if I didn't like hairless office those things new doctor I know I mean I understand that they're trying to keep us off opioids and they're trying to make things safer for us but treating us like crap isn't helping and you know these are these are doctors that we've seen for periods of time it's not like we are doctor shopping and we're going to the doctor's doctor and doctor that would be you know pill seeking behavior or narcotic seeking behavior and you if you stay with that same doctor you use the same exact Hospital every freakin time how is any of that so I was really upset about it in that so needless to say we decided that we are gonna go after the doctor because this needs this crap all care stopped when she found out I was using marijuana you know the medical marijuana it's legal in this state I mean is it's legal in this state you can't just stop care because you don't agree that I'm using cannabis I'm not doing anything wrong I'm not doing anything illegal so because it passed in this state you're gonna have to adapt and start getting an education on cannabis and getting that into the healthcare system so the healthcare system understands how to help us because they are cutting us off and being total dicks and stopping treatment because we're using cannabis is not going to work you want us to get off of pills and this and that another we're using cannabis to try to get off those pills because it's better of course because it's never killed anybody yet you're getting mad because we're off those pills we have to have something this means too much for us to bear on a daily basis without something that same doctor is the one who told me get my medical cannabis card as soon as I got it he started acting and see and this woman understand is it I get that you know and honestly let me let me say this to be getting I have not done research so I don't know for sure but in my opinion it feels like how do you say this correctly it feels like they're okay if we you know get it's a high off of cannabis but they're not okay if we use it to treat something they want us to get off of these pillows because oh my god we're gonna get sued and this is all going to be bad against us yep they're not gonna give us something well fall back mmm what is that some way to you so you know prohibition has never worked alcohol is just as bad as dangerous as as pills can be especially if you're mixing any of them and eat that's an even by mixing a simple medication like blood pressure medication and alcohol can be a bad idea it can cause a whole I mean it's very much so not recommended so it's not even narcotics that you have to make some the alcohol with in order to get those effects but what do they want us to do you know this is population control this is their way of saying we're going to control it you're doing yeah exactly they don't mind writing a script if we don't need their pills they don't want to make you write and it's like Big Pharma has paid them to get pissed off at us and to treat us badly if we move to medical marijuana because the Big Pharma can't touch it Big Pharma hasn't been able to do anything with it and Big Pharma was losing money in the states that that marijuana is born legal so now they're trying to recourse so now it feels like I feel like the doctors are paid to do this to us so when did medicine turn into money business from actually healing the patient because the last time I checked there's a Hippocratic oath it says that you're going to help somebody no matter what and that's not being upheld in this particular type of a base he didn't like it when I told him I wanted to do things naturally and not be in all these pills that's when you completely changed with me yeah you know it's it's [ __ ] the turnaround there you don't mean about it but they get us hooked on this [ __ ] and then they're like but we will try you on something else Oh give me a time it off it's now time but I'll link to all these other issues so really it's population control allowing Big Pharma to control our lives and to control our medical industry Big Pharma controls a huge part of America any time one of us gets sick big firms there and we have to go to the doctor who you know which by the way the doctors push big pharma because they're just going to keep handing it to you however if you're a diabetic you're not gonna be able to you know a diabetic somebody who is dependent you know type one diabetic somebody who's dependent on daily insulin has to have glucagon if he drops too far they drop too far down and you gotta pay for that too we don't we don't care they that's a life saving medication we just now know that we got this money out of you every month for the rest of your life oh yeah and if you haven't noticed mostly DARS report oh yeah I've noticed that one that treated me that I'm going after because of the Medical Marijuana she was born I'm not sure what her ethnicity is and quite honestly I don't care because I've had a lot of great doctors that you know actually I've had a lot of really great urologists that have been Boren and I had any issues with this this lady however because she stopped treatment I have an issue with her I don't have an issue with her because of her ethnicity but yes we have noticed I'm gonna make this nice one more on pain management I mean yeah you run pain management you're gonna win the game because people are going to work they hurt oh I know they don't care about any of these ourselves and that's a problem once you're here and you're a part of our communities look around I mean I don't care if you're boring I don't care if you're domestic I don't care quite frankly who you are but you know take a look around the world that you live in if you want to change something in my opinion it's better to change things with kindness you know introduce yourself and intermingle within that community learn some of their ways start teaching some of yours you know kind of back and forth the type of a situation become a part of that community and everything is awesome as noticing it doesn't matter that's what the United States is about we are about every shade of color they're about every person that's what we fought for our independence for is we thought we were all foreign at one point in time unless you're in native the u.s. American Indian we are all foreign eyes happy to have you here so yeah why don't you come here though now it's time to cue practice that oh and and practice it with the people that you're with you know start looking at you know and doctors oh my goodness I don't care what your I think this is guy start looking at your patient and understanding that we know what our body is doing we can feel it we can feel that something's going on with our body and we know that it's not right yeah we all come from someplace else we do I'm a dork my origins come out of Germany and the European countries so yeah I we're all you know different that's why ancestry.com is collecting all of our stuff so the way you know they can map it out and see oh my god their bedside manner is so bad so bad but you don't get it being a hospital doctor I mean you have to deal with different people every day with different problems some are in pain some are are in pain but they want to go home they're angry they're frustrated these patients are going off on the nurses the nurses getting irritated I get it totally get it I mean it's it's hard to be a a hospital doctor you are them running around the most you are doing the most you are you know that is one time I wouldn't want sorry's right Hey you know I love meeting people I love seeing people but not in that situation it would be hell it really would that's why I really do try to be nice to my doctors and my nurses um you know if you're gonna stop treatment because I'm using cannabis I got an issue with you and and we're gonna go face-to-face at one point in time and I got something to say because you have no rights in a legal state in the United States to stop me from using cannabis to help get me off a big pharma scrap different perspectives and most by outside the US expat for years and early age yes yeah they did and that's you know you know imma show you're absolutely correct that's the same thing I said that I say to everybody that I know I understand they go through a lot but they signed that for that is absolutely correct I have you know had my kids there you guys you picked it you're the one that went down there filled up that job application and took the job that comes along with it if you're in construction you've got us you've got a horrible last day because it's either gonna be plenty you've got every freaking weather that you're gonna have to work in that's hell and you're gonna have bones get hurt and joints that's swell and it's gonna be horrible yeah so well it's getting really kind of dogs dogs are trying to me and I said five minutes I know dinner's ready so I am out of here overall and straight jump yeah it was nice to see you guys this evening I will see you guys again [Music] don't forget that thumbs up and hit that subscribe button right there come on you got it", "jj4-LubDOKs": "a Florida medical marijuana patients what's happening this is Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with an updated Blue Dream whole flower video from Liberty Health Sciences now this strain is great the flower is great the trichomes are great the percentages are great I'm happy with just about everything but the trim on it is still subpar like you could still get a little bit of these sugar leaves off of here and be selling us true whole nugs rather than you know excess weight but nonetheless let's get back to the price here they have increased your price from twenty eight dollars and eight to thirty three dollars in eight the which to me is completely unwarranted I don't see how you could be charging a base twenty eight dollars for all of your aids across the board from super a five to even Starkiller when it first started but now Starkiller is forty dollars and eighth now Blue Dream is magically 33 dollars an eighth but super a five which was oddly my favorite of the first two super a five and Blue Dream is still only twenty eight dollars it just doesn't make sense to me honestly really doesn't I think it's bad business practice just like I think it's bad business practice how they lied about free statewide delivery for so long while completely denying the Panhandle with the Pensacola store open in the Panama City Beach store open there probably is not a problem anymore but it still makes me salty like good relationships are kept by continuing to do the good things you started off doing in the beginning thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews", "KktxcKrJfkI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

got a package here don't worry a roof the packaging label off myself they're just hide some evidence but this package came from Elvis haa of blue crown aquatic I've been really loving their stuff lately great shrimp on these these are fancy red Tigers sorry about that fancy red Tigers that came from the same line that one the aquatic experience 2018 champion I actually already have the white dominant version of this line as well that I got from row peach in of a blue crown aquatics previously so these ones are going to go into a different tank than that even though they're basically from the same line you never have enough tanks of fancy red Tigers right open this up great packaging is normal Oh three munch a bunch of food here's their card so like I said I've worked with Jason in the past you could see if you go back and watch some my previous videos I got my royal my original royal blue Tigers from Jason probably about two years ago now which are doing great I actually have four colonies of them now all this is where these are from and Roby I've gotten a couple of shrimp Elvis I've gotten some shadow pandas from him in the past two so this is not my first rodeo with blue crown aquatics I am a fan pull that out i won these actually in an auction so these are actually from Elvis's tank these are home bred by Elvis and yes he had them in an auction and then I was the high bidder I'm very happy to have them well he gave me a little drawing of a shrimpy there too it's pretty cool water feels a bit cold but that's to be expected it's definitely winter so I'm gonna take a closer look at these it's hard to see through the vegg but it looks like they are all alive I don't see any new any bodies at the bottom of the bag there so we'll get these in a specimen container and take a closer look prepared prepared actually gonna cut this just to make my life a little bit easier these bags are actually a little bit thicker than what I'm used to thicker I'm not sure if they're breather bags or not but they're definitely got some thickness so my average holding cut slowly lay the bag down and you want to keep one end above the water one end below the water over the bag there so it doesn't vacuum seal on you and you dump them in and then you very closely examine the bag hold it up to light like what I'm doing now make sure there's no shrimp bees left so let's see here get the foam out of there make sure there's no shrimpy stuck on that foam there and then we can take a closer look I'm sure there are they're gonna be stressed out as they just went through a hell of a trip so it's hard to get a good shot of them from this angle let's see if I can get a better shot down there it's a little better for sure some beautiful fancy red Tigers knocking things over if anyone's curious that was a lamp that I just knocked over no biggie we're looking at shrimp no time for that right now as you can see they're a little stressed out the red color and some of them has faded away and that's completely normal so we'll see let's get these guys acclimating this is going to be their new home it is a 29 gallon tank it's got bright well aqua soil in there sponge filters a little driftwood little sub Wasser tag it's been seated with Simo and some other products snowflake early bits little bacterias probiotics and here we have the drip system so what I have here is basically just the airline tube with a air like adjustment knob and what that does is it slowly lets me adjust the amount of terrific and that just drips and fills and once this container will fit autofill and it will automatically stop here because of gravity it'll stop at the at the water level and then what I'll do is I'll drain it back down to a little lower than this again and let it refill again and then after that point I will scoop up these little guys I get a few shots of them once they're in their new home you", "b6DP4pI4igs": "yo what's good everybody j ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i am here with a west coast wheat tour review today's product is a cannabis extract it is the full spectrum oil whoops from emerald bay extracts here in california this is a blue dream rso so one gram syringe squeeze it on out we're looking at thc 79.35 percent 70 793.5 milligrams cbd 1.7 milligrams so this is definitely more of a sativa dominant product not so much a lot of cbd inside of it just a little bit though to give it that enrage effect pick this up at the royal healing emporium and lamb poke so super dope product we're gonna get this on open i'm gonna do a small tasting of it and then give you guys um you know kind of like describe the taste the flavor any kind of immediate feelings things like that so important to know that rso is rick simpson oil it is ideally what kind of got cannabis legalized in a lot of senses is the medicinal properties that this kind of product really brings smoking does a lot for a lot of people but unfortunately it just isn't healthy for a lot of people as well so you think about cancer patients needing a true product and that's where this medicinal item comes into play the syringe again full plant extract here we go check this out you guys so definitely something you want to keep away from the kids keep away from pets all that good stuff this is real real real medicine y'all so for me i use sativas and cbd's cbd rsos for my ibs i treat my back pain i've got some spine issues and some some things like that and so um you know the long hours on the road and standing and even doing these videos and things like that i have to kind of be aware of managing my my pain and my symptoms and cbd desert and and these blue dream rso specifically do a really good job of helping with that so all we're going to do here is open this on up i think i can just yep twist right there give you guys a view oh oh oh oh oh let me just say oh yeah i can just twist off that cap there we go there we go all right all right so it's pretty simple uh you can run hot water over it to squeeze it out um this one should be good though yeah nothing too hard um when it comes to the amount that you're supposed to do ideally you want to do a great rice or a grain size piece i'm gonna do about half of that just because it's the middle of the day for me and i've already smoked and stuff so i don't need this by itself right now i like to put it underneath the tongue it tends to work a little quicker flavor-wise this is supposed to taste like weed you're definitely not trying to mask it there's no sugar nothing like that it's 100 plant extract you can see it kind of stains the fingers just a little bit i don't think i got any of my teeth but yeah it's a very much a high quality product meant for patients meant for people in need of strain specific effects i do enjoy rso products that blend strains you know a high thc product with four strains in it is awesome but i also like you know these strain specific blue dreams and things like that i think there's value in both sides so when i think about the experience on this you know i really enjoy blue dream as a strain it's light it's energetic provides a little bit of focus has usually it has a higher higher quantities of cbg uh and thc on this particular product it doesn't list the terpene information or some of the other like factoids you know it has thc and cbd but it could have some of the other cannabinoids tested on there and i think that would be important uh cbc cbgs thcvs things like that um but this does taste very good um i know that i'm going to have a good jolt of energy and focus here for the next few hours if not for the next like six hours this tends to come in waves for me so flavor was very good nice and earthy definitely no alcohol taste which is huge some brands you can definitely get the alcohol it wasn't purged right or whatever it is um perhaps but this one really good so score out of 10 price point was pretty affordable 45 gram a little on the high side but there was there was actually about 110 to 120 milligrams of thc higher than some of the other brands that we like to buy rso wise here in cali so i'm willing to pay that higher price for that extra 120 milligrams um i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten it's kind of where i'm leaning um i would like some more cbd this is where it's like a high thc blue dream at 79 80 percent would have been great to have another strain blended in for some more cbd but i can't complain i think a 9 out of 10 is a really great score this is a product that if someone needs 800 milligrams of thc for the day smoke a little bit eat an edible and pop this in and you're good to go so something i really recommend emerald bay extracts this is a west coast weed tour review jay ping

welcome back to another one if you are new to the channel i am gold pony i do new car truck suv reviews on youtube and today we are in the new 2021 hyundai sonata hybrid courtesy of jack giovalvo hyundai in york pa for more information on their inventory please feel free to check out the link in the description box below it's i wanted to hop in this one today not only because it is a very good looking sedan and i'm not just saying that because i own a 2020 sonata of course but this is also capable of hitting 50 plus miles per gallon i'll get into the exact mpg numbers in a little bit here but also america's best warranty being five-year 60 000 mile bumper-to-bumper 10-year 100 000 miles on the powertrain that is amazing three years of complementary maintenance as well so you don't have to pay for the oil changes tire rotations things like that and so in this video i will be testing out and going over everything about this one testing out acceleration braking steering feel ride quality sound system and so on so what do you guys say let's just go ahead and jump right into it and as always let's start with pricing and said there will be actually three different trim levels for the sonata hybrid first one being blue which is the one we actually have today starting at twenty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars sel for twenty nine thousand nine hundred and lastly the limited starting at thirty five thousand three hundred dollars and so when it comes to the power plant that will be the same amongst the trim levels powering the sonata hybrid will be a two liter atkinson cycle inline four cylinder engine that part of the power plant produces 150 horsepower at 6000 rpm 139 pound-feet of torque available at 5000 rpm but then there is the electric motor which is a 270 watt lithium ion polymer battery which produces an additional 51 horsepower 151 pound-feet of torque so all in all power numbers when you combine them come in at 192 horsepower 271 pound-feet of torque but so all in all that power will be sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic by the way when it comes to the six-speed automatic to put it in drive there's actually just buttons located kind of in the center here the d is going to be for drive r's for reverse p is for park and it's for neutral sometimes i get questions on that so i wanted to mention it but nonetheless to 60 time comes in at approximately eight seconds flat mpg numbers get ready for this 50 in the city 54 on the highway for the blue trim level that's going to be your best mpgs but then for the sel unlimited that bumps it down to 45 in the city 51 on the highway which is still incredible but anyways i also wanted to mention for the limited trim level you actually get a solar powered roof system that directly charges the 12 volt and hybrid batteries that's pretty cool system also allows an additional two miles of driving range per day as well i don't have that today to show it to you guys but just imagine a solar powered roof it's going to be black it's pretty cool setup if you want to look it up anyway 686 miles of range for the blue trim that we have today i will say this isn't fully loaded up but it is showing me i have 550 miles of range left so that is pretty cool so even though it's not showing me the 686 still 550 miles of range you're going to be driving forever until you have to fill this cig up this is pretty cool but anyways before we do any kind of paddle shifter acceleration test here in our sonata hybrid i do want to mention there are a couple different drive modes a drive mode toggle switch is located just behind the drive buttons they will include custom sport eco and smart adjusting things like the shift points the throttle response and the steering sensitivity so now having got all of that out of the way you guys i'm uh i'm gonna go ahead and put in a sport driving mode here and let's uh let's put the paddle shifters to the test here first just want to see how quickly they react for us and then we'll move on to the acceleration test um yeah there's definitely a delay it's i mean i didn't expect the paddle shifters to be lightning quick like some of the other hyundai's like the veloster and things like that with the dual clutch but still glad they're there you could always use it for a little bit of engine braking when you're going down a hill maybe when it's snowing out but they're definitely not the quickest reactor paddle shifters i ever tested so i wanted to mention that but now having said that let's go ahead and give back full control to the sonata hybrid and let's do a quick little acceleration test here and let's see how quickly we can get this new 2021 hyundai sonata hybrid here up to speed three two one go oh my gosh actually definitely not bad this thing is a pretty decent acceleration i got to be honest that kind of surprised me since we're in a hybrid but then again a lot of cars with the battery powered it is instant torque so it is a lot quicker than you would expect it to be so plenty of an acceleration for the sonata hybrid without a doubt but to go along with that acceleration as always braking is equally important so of course you will get power assisted four-wheel disc brakes for the sonata hybrid also regenerative braking because it's a hybrid it's got that battery powered as well but having said that when it comes to the braking feel it's different that's the way i think i'm going to describe it so it's a little bit grabby at low speeds at high speeds you're pretty much good to go but it's definitely different than its non-hybrid counterpart the sonata without the hybrid configuration so we'll say that not a bad thing just a different thing but anyways then touching on suspension and handling up front you're going to get a mcpherson strut front suspension in the back independent multi-link rear suspension as far as ride quality goes that has been 100 on point in my short test drive today ride quality is definitely i would even say above average for its class so very nice ride quality on the sonata hybrid as far as steering feel goes it's pretty much as expected i will say it's a little bit more on the looser side if i'm being honest so it doesn't quite point you in the direction as quickly as some of the other vehicles out there but still it's not bad it's just a little bit on the looser side that's all as far as cabin noise goes that's something i feel like hyundai's got to work on a little bit with the sonata and some of the other vehicles like the santa fe as well you do get a decent amount of wind noise at higher speeds maybe about 50 miles per hour and up especially on the driver's side so we'll say that maybe you guys can notice it right now i'm only at 40 miles per hour but there is a little bit of wind noise coming into the cabin so i wanted to mention that but i will say having said that you do get an acoustic laminated front windshield for all trim levels but the acoustic laminated front door glass only comes on the scl unlimited and maybe that is why i'm getting the wind noise because i don't have the seller limited so maybe it's just the blue trim that we have today i don't know but i did want to mention it to you guys nonetheless but not touching on visibility i can see perfectly fine out the back visibility is 100 on point without a doubt also wanted to mention though rain sensing windshield wipers do come standard on the sonata hybrid gotta love that and if you wanted a head up display for even further visibility simply go with the limited trim level and that will display your speed as well as the speed limit and some safety information up on your windshield so you're less likely to take your eyes off the road so it's kind of a safety feature there in itself but that about rounds out the performance segment of this review you guys let's now go ahead and take a look at the exterior of our brand new 2021 hyundai sonata hybrid all right so here she is you guys the new 2021 hyundai sonata hybrid finished in portofino gray looks pretty darn good in the snow we'll say that let's go ahead and start up front of this one first thing i wanted to mention if you were comparing this to the non-hybrid sonata there is going to be a unique front fascia compared to those non-hybrid sonatas so hybrid gets his own front face you guys could probably tell the difference if you've seen the other one right now with the chrome bar going across the entire front end there that's probably the main difference and also the grille is going to be a little bit different as well but nonetheless to the sides led headlights do come standard they do of course come with the automatic feature meaning when it starts to get dark out at night they are going to turn on automatically for you there led lasso daytime running lights love that you guys can kind of see that let me get up closer to show you but these lasso led lights actually come up onto the hood and then they slowly fade out i love this design it looks like nothing else on the road right now there are no other manufacturers doing that i think that's pretty cool because i like the uniqueness of it but nonetheless automatic high beams actually come standard on every single trim level as well meaning if you just said that and there's a car coming in the opposite direction it is going to dim those high beams down or put it back to low beams i should say and then when that vehicle is gone it's going to put it back to high beams for you so which yet another thing you don't have to worry about while actually driving so i think that's pretty cool full led headlights are going to come on the limited trim level only and you will get a gloss black front grille with some chrome accents for every single trim level as well but now let's go ahead and make our way to the side of the sonata hybrid here all right and so now since we are around to the side chrome window surrounds do come standard across the board matte black side sill molding coming with the blue trim level only and let me get up close to show you guys what i'm talking about here essentially what that means is these pillars that kind of connect the windows here that is going to be matte black only on the blue trim level because otherwise if you were to go with the scl or limited it's actually going to be changed to gloss black in case anybody was curious there now moving back out body colored door handles do come with our blue trim level that we have here today you're actually going to get satin chrome accents for the sel unlimited trims then then take a look at the side mirrors they are body colored power adjustable side mirrors for all trims you'll also get led integrated turn signals for ultron levels as well it's pretty cool you don't always get that on base trim level so i thought that was pretty cool and if you were to go with the sel are limited those side mirrors will be heated as well for super cold freezing days in pennsylvania quite like today but now let's go ahead and take a look at the wheel setup looking down 16-inch alloys coming with the blue trim that we have today then if you were to jump up to the seller limited you will find 17-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels and that's a pretty cool design i will say that too but now let's go ahead and make our way to the back of the sonata here all right so now since we are around back led taillights do come standard for all trim levels you will find that sonata lettering spelled out horizontally amongst the rear trunk there that looks pretty good led license plate lighting also coming standard is pretty cool you will get that hybrid badging in the back hybrid blue badging if you were to go with that particular trim level so we got that there too and of course again if you were comparing this to the standard sonata this is a unique rear bumper for the hybrid only so i do want to mention that and if you were to look down just below it all single exhaust outlet tucked away but nonetheless do believe you guys know what we have to do next it's probably not going to turn on for me since this is a hybrid but we're going to give it a shot as always here is that exhaust clip all right so now since we are around back of the sonata hybrid when it comes to opening that rear trunk there are several different ways you can go ahead and do that first way is of course there is a button on the key fob itself that is one way but my favorite way to open up the sonata trunk is there is a hidden button within the hyundai logo towards the top of it if you simply just press in within the hyundai logo that is the coolest way you're going to be able to open that rear trunk and if you don't own a hyundai you're probably not going to know about it but that is the secret way that is the coolest i would go ahead and do that but once opened up cargo capacity is going to come in at 16 cubic feet if that was not enough space there is a 60 40 split meaning the rear seats do fold down for quite a bit of extra space then if you needed it then make your way to the rear legroom that is going to come in at 34.8 inches so for reference i mean even six feet tall this is how much space i had back there demon also mentioned for those rear passengers there is a rear center armrest with cup holders if you were to go with the limited trim level only you're not going to get that with the blue or the sel so i wanted to mention that rear ventilation however does come standard for every single trim level across the board and there is a single usb charging port just below that again for every single trim level across the board so i do appreciate that but then make your way up to the front seat six-way manually adjustable driver seat for the blue trim level that we have today eight weight power driver seat for the sel unlimited and that comes with a four-way power adjustable passenger seat then as well you will find cloth seating with the blue or sel and then leather seating if you were to go with the limited heated front seats are going to come on the sel and limited ventilated front seats for just the limited trim level and then that limited also going to give you memory settings for the driver's seat as well so that's pretty cool but overall seats are plenty fine they're plenty comfy not the most comfortable seats i've ever felt but they will definitely get the job done but now let's go ahead and make our way to the steering wheel it is tilt and telescoping it is leather wrapped if you were to go with the scl or limited otherwise it's going to be wrapped in urethane which is what you guys are looking at right now and then there is a heated steering wheel as well if you were to go with the limited trim level only but now let's make our way to the startup let me first start by showing you guys the key here you do have your hyundai logo on the one side and when you flip it over lock unlock that button to pop the rear hatch and the circular button when it says hold that is going to be your remote start which is pretty cool that comes standard on every single trim level across the board dimmer also mentioned though hyundai digital key comes with the sel limited you just download an app on your smartphone then you don't even need your keys anymore because then your smartphone is how you're going to get in and out of this thing as well as start it up that's a pretty cool feature i got on my own sonata and ultimately it is all keyless entry with a push button start so all i am going to do is simply put my phone on the brake and press that silver engine start button located just to the left of the air vents there and so once started up what you guys are looking at is the standard gauge cluster that comes with the blue trim and the sel we'll say though the limited trim is going to give you a 12.3 inch digital gauge cluster which is what i have in mind i absolutely love it this gauge cluster is all right it's kind of old school a little bit but it's not bad but i will say the digital gauge cluster is better because it's more customizable but anyways you could still adjust a ton of different things by using the steering wheel mounted controls on the right side you could check out your fuel economy at any given time it's probably what i would leave it on if i had a hybrid also a digital speedometer you could display up there at engine temperature tire pressure how many miles you have left until you hit empty outside temperature the list goes on so pretty much everything you could possibly want up there then taking a look at overall interior quality wireless phone charger coming with the sel unlimited don't have that today but it will be located just in front of the drive buttons if you did get it auto dimming rear view mirror with homelink controls for the limited dual zoom climate control for all trim levels leather wrapped dashboard for the limited only and that limited is also going to add led interior lighting 64 colors of ambient lighting actually we have dual usb charging ports up here as well along with the 12 volt power outlet so where you would typically find the wireless phone charger in the blue trim it's actually just going to be rubberized kind of storage i guess you could say just behind that you have dual cup holders with a little slot in the middle to put yourself in if you wanted to and i do like design a lot of manufacturers will leave this design around the cup holders kind of a boring matte black but we kind of do have a nice diamond or square pattern design located around that so i do like that just behind all of it you do have a center armrest with a decent amount of space in there so i certainly don't have any objections to that but overall it's kind of on the basic side with the blue trim level at least the limited is really going to take you above and beyond so if you wanted a lot better of interior quality go with the limited trim level for this and not a hybrid here but now let's go ahead and make our way to the tech display now it is going to differ once again amongst the trim levels eight inch color touchscreen display coming with the blue and sel that's what you're looking at right now then if you were to go with the limited you will get a 10 and a quarter inch color touch screen display but for the most part you pretty much got everything you want on this eight inch color touch screen display and the reason i say that you still get bluetooth in audio streaming you still get android auto apple carplay meaning if you have a smartphone just hook it up to the sonata hybrid then therefore you have free navigation displayed up on that color touch screen display as well as the ability to like and dislike your pandora songs there's a couple other compatible apps up there as well of course factory navigation system is going to come with a limited trim level only although you don't really need it if you have a smartphone anyways climate control settings you can check out up there as well there is a cool little hybrid icon button on the hybrid specifically for the sonata here which i think is pretty cool it kind of tells you how much battery life you have left also your average miles per gallon your electric motor use at any given time that is actually what i would leave it on that's pretty darn cool i like that but anyways you can also of course check out your radio information up there as well six speakers is going to come with the blue trim that we have today then if you were to jump up to the seller limited you're going to get a 12 speaker bose sound system so having said that you guys we do have the six speaker sound system here today but you know what i haven't tested this one i don't think so let's go ahead and turn on the radio see we got playing today and let's test out our six speaker sound system that we have today [Music] i gotta be honest it's one of the better six speaker sound systems that i've heard in quite a while really decent amount of bass there clarity was fine but i mean it's not going to be a bose sound system but for a six-picker sound system that went above and beyond i liked that but anyways last thing i wanted to mention to you guys on the tech display at least is when you do of course put the sonata hybrid in reverse you will find a rear view camera coming standard for every single trim level across the board which is always is going to lead us into safety and so first thing i wanted to mention iihs top safety pick that says it all right there front side side curtain airbags also coming standard driver's knee airbag in the front in the back you're going to have latch aka lower anchors and tethers for children for the rear car seats rear child door locks back there tire pressure monitoring system as well it's all pretty boring stuff at this point but some of the more exciting safety features for the sonata hybrid include forward collision avoidance assist and pedestrian detection lane keep assist lane following assist driver attention warning system adaptive cruise control with stop and go which is an amazing system for the sonata let me tell you guys you simply just set that using the steering wheel mounted controls on the right side here and it's essentially going to follow the car in front of you it slows down when they slow down even to a stop and then it speeds up when they speed up it keeps you centered in the lane it's a wonderful system i will say that so well done hyundai for that rear occupant alert also comes standard safe exit warning a blind spot monitoring system with rear cross traffic alert that's going to be the little car icons in the sign mirrors all of that coming standard then if you were to go with the limited that does add some additional things like the blind spot view monitor it's going to be displayed within the digital gauge cluster front and rear parking sensors highway driving assist which is hyundai's level two autonomous driving system that's pretty cool and rear parking collision avoidance assist as well so overall when it comes to my final thoughts here of the sonata hybrid 50 plus miles per gallon is excellent if you have a long commute to work this is definitely one you guys got to check out that is an amazing mpg number and it's amazing because you consider the size of the sonata as well you still got room to put kids in the back and car seats in the back even i put car seats in the back of my own set on and it works out fine so you don't even have to fold the front passenger seat up or anything like i used to have to do in the civic so also a max range of 686 miles in this blue trim that we have today that's absolutely wonderful even seeing 534 is absolutely ridiculous i know my standard sonata i think it's 460 or 465 somewhere in that ballpark so that's pretty good to you i guess but digital gauges also are amazing on the sonata 64 colors of ambient lighting if you go with the limited great interior quality with the limited in this blue trim it's okay not the very best but it's okay perhaps my only constructive criticism when it comes to this one is the breaking feel again it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just a different thing i'm not used to it it's definitely when whenever you have hybrids and this is what i've noticed with all the hybrids that i've shrinked so far the breaking feel is always a little bit wonky just a little bit different kind of grabs in certain areas at lower speeds more than it should be so i don't know it's just a little bit different but overall let me know what you guys think of this new sonata hybrid in the comment section below that is about it for this one you guys thank you so much for watching feel free to follow me on tick-tock bottom of the screen if you wanted to see what's coming next on

a membership that I had myself and you get a glass piece every month for $29.99 a month it's supposed to give you your supplies for a41 right in this box this month's box is supposed to be pretty good I've been having some pretty good stuff but you know not very exciting let's see how this one is look at the front cover you should already give you an idea what the glass piece is gonna be glass pieces right here make that last the little bowl just to package it in to give you a little wax Mack never had one of these before this is brand new they're upgrading little by little they die cuts doing their thing they give you a blunt splitter from kingpin a raw clipper later bears where I've been getting all my clipper ladies look at this this is for Halloween this one's free this month is not really like anything new anything but it's wrong then we have a little doobie tube which a little sticker inside I have like six of these already and then we also have a pack of herbal wraps tobacco free xx pedal brushing cream like I said supply you for a month I don't think they'll last but they also give you a pack of raw papers brand new and maybe I can see in the jar it's a glass tip that says DHC we're gonna open it up they gave me one not that long ago it was Tommy Chong's but I lost it so this replaces my last one did it like I said guys it's $30 a month they give you a little

like the stickers let me know I can give them out now let's see the glass piece all right you guys y'all ready look at this look at this that's a rocket bubbler he's a little Bowl in his little packaging to this bad boy right there I'm supposed to make you lift off then hey so since we already have it I have a little bit of some gelato right there kind of sprite this up a little bit let's see how this rocket hits not sharing this hole looks pretty small to put some water in but I'm not sure I want to put it - yeah I think I'm gonna put it through you all right perfect gelato breaks them down real quick got to do this the old-fashioned way always like it old-fashioned don't like it broken down too much turns into dust all righty see this is a straight hit you feel this view you milk this up I'll have you feeling pretty good but that finishes off the daily high clubs unboxing like I said I appreciate it daily I clubs good look out like it every time is upgrading every month is getting better but like my usual videos we're going into pain tapes alright usually I'm vaping my thanks on a vision spinner but sadly about a week ago from my last video I accidentally lost the battery and I stepped on it so I bent the tip of where the paint goes and I can't use it no more so I went into a lookout went on the website and I ordered this from whose is a twist slim pin preheat mode because with the charger already with it and suppose II the charger that is in here it automatically knows when to turn off when your battery is fully charged so it won't overcharge it so if you don't use this charger you're gonna gonna break your warranty guys save the charger don't use those cheap find all these charges from some friends little gas stations this ISO package pop it off in here because of this charge already screwed on you can mess with the temperature at the bottom you can spin it all the way to through 4.8 volts and the charger all righty the battery the battery looks pretty nice a little all at the bottom with the whole symbol has it on the little button as well and guys I got to think thanks today to ding beats today listening I have this one which is blue dream it was a request one 24/7 vape life thanks for the request my god I was able to get my hands on it here it is blue dream from Dean babes like always I think Bates official all organic no propylene glycol it also has a little story on the back I'll leave that down in the description and it's eighty nine point ninety nine percent THC this is an indica with a sativa so it's a crossing of an indica with a sativa and then I also have Jack Herer when dink Bates as well look at this that beautiful oil besides always out of a pink pigs official all organic no propylene glycol strolling on the back as well I'll leave Bolton down the description if you're interested and this one is ninety six point twelve percent THC this is a sativa dominant eye I messed with it because but you know for today I think I'm okay with uh sativa and they cuz make me want to go to sleep so we'll start off with the jack herer like always comes with a little seal at the bottom and I've always said guys if it's not a C cell it's not a dink vape also it's supposed to be a kosher tank has a little K at the bottom guys should be looking for these things and it comes with a clear plastic tip I guess is not glass is plastic and a good thing about these tanks is if you drop them they don't break as easy I've had a brass knuckles it broke after a job to like twice these I dropped them a couple times they just pick them back up on they're burning like like new let's see how this goes yeah let's taste it without hitting it without actually burning it how's that go and I can't say it's not piney it's like grassy like earthy herbal kind of teas I'm sure but it's it's not sweet at all like it's not anything I'm used to vaping but see how the highest all right off the bat the hits pretty strong it's really potent but it doesn't taste anywhere sweet it has a grassy horrible taste you wouldn't need much to be feeling lit on something like this it's 96 percent is about the highest I've ever had I am I've had a king Louie it's like 95% but this one to me it was the highest egg I've got my hands on it's 96 let's try one more thing all right I ain't joking you ain't smoking but if you can get your hands on it I would recommend it so me I'll give it a 9 out of 10 cuz I'm I'm already feeling pretty good I'm not even sure if I'm gonna make it through the blue dream after this but let's go on to the next one like I said guys I've been getting database a lot I got one brass knuckles I probably won't even go back after these kids done the blue dream like I said it was a requested video so I'm combining them both right here this is oil here's a seal so Cecil as well like I said all of them are the same this battery is way better too it's like the perfect battery to be burning the soil the hits bigger this this one it was good it lasted longer this one doesn't last as long but the hit when you burn it is way better than the vision spinner all right let's see how's that go a blue blueberry taste but then it has like a date taste as well like you actually taste it in there see how it is all right this one as well it's pretty good I would say if you can get your hands on it as well it does have a sweeter taste in a Jack Herer which is this one and it's even less potent than a Jack Herer but it's I think it would be one of my favorites I'll give it an 8 out of 10 as well flavor a 9 out of 10 has a blueberry type of flavor not sure what other flavor has inside it but it's pretty good like I said guys stay tuned this will be in my next video don't forget to Like and subscribe [Music]", "qmzN5rA3aa8": "unlike Blue Dream which is a hybrid beyondblue dream is a pure sativa and puts you in a creative mode ready to work while still retaining full body relaxation with a relatively potent

needs", "eQUmBJUFgbo": "hey guys this is Alexander Williamson and this is the secret history living inside your aquarium and I am doing an unboxing a very very special unboxing from lrb aquatics none other than Lucas our Brett's himself and he has sent me out a package I bought a bunch of yellow shrimp and he messaged me and said hey you want to do some designs for me so we have some limited edition shirts coming out soon for his channel and his brand I don't want to show my address up there but I almost missed this package I got the alert that it had arrived not to mention that I was out at our biggest auction of the year for our fish club and I managed to pick up let's see a bag of pindy pelvic Acronis tinny honest a bag of pelvic Acronis pulcher and another bag of dozen moly way pelvic Acronis tinny honest as well as some vinegar eels and a Daphnia starter and a tank all of that was $45 altogether which is awesome so that was the icing on top of the cake but it meant that I needed to rush home as soon as I got the alert that this was here and I know that sometimes it's delayed so I get home and I get the alert as I walk up the door that it's delivered it's not here so what happens I run down I see the mailman down the street and I say do you have a box a lot of fish in your truck says nah I delivered it to six zero one six and I said that that's that's not even the right numbers you know I won't tell you my address but it was off in the beginning and the end so he was off and it was up a hill so I run down like three blocks trying to figure out where is it's not where he said it is and it's at the house that did actually have numbers transposed similar to mine and so I got a hold of it the heat packs are still room temperature which is awesome because this is the beginning of day three and Lucas is a pro he's been shipping for like a decade so I had no worries about his shipping ability I do have worries about the ability of the post office this is downright hot still so it looks like he wrapped it up here in an in a in a bag I'm gonna try to do this one-handed for y'all I'll just use a little razor blade so let's cut this open we'll do a true unboxing how's that for an unprecedented on the channel you're actually gonna see the point of view of my fingers alright so I know I have yellow shrimp coming the rest I kind of know but it's a bit of a mystery wow we've got triple bag maybe looks like triple bagging so let's get this bagging I know it's blurry and blurry so very insulated plus we've got foam wrap in every corner foam wrap foam wrap foam wrap which is great because I hate styrofoam I have this weird thing where styrofoam gives me goose bumps so let's pull out what he has sent so these look like what do we have here so this is supposed to be his own private stock here it looks like if it's what I think it is and these are his end lers and these are his leopard end lers that are the king stock they're not out to the public this is because I'm doing the limited edition shirts for him and looks like they're in a breather bag which is awesome and let's try to get a view of them maybe up against the white we can get something and they're obviously stressed but they're all healthy oh wow they've got true rainbow colors and a spade paddle tail with color around the edges this parody is their own tank there's there's no doubt about that Wow that is beautiful Thank You Lucas that is so incredible I'm so excited I just asked for a pair I thought I was being really difficult by asking for a certain pair of a certain critter and oh all his shrimp are alive these look to be the eight yellows these are Europe to Alex Williamson eight and these are yellow shrimp Neil caridina they're also obviously low in color he's got some plants in there which is always good it looks like maybe Pearl wheat or something I know he's got a pearl weed addiction going on so that's awesome it's the right way to ship shrimp not that I have any word to speak on that and then let's see here so then we've got oh my gosh oh my goodness this is what I have been dreaming of so these are his I think these are the world's best blue shrimp and I don't know if that is a beedi Oh blue dream the world's best 10 Plus that is so awesome and you're seeing the mess in my house but I have waited for so long to get these again mine died in the gut and attack of 2018 the beginning of this year and I only had a few left at that point anyways just due to time and I'm so excited to have these thank you so much Lucas for sending those out I think let's see here oh we got we have more we have more so then we've got Ludwig er colada which is just a nice pretty plant he sells the stem for a buck 50 good deal Lucas has great prices for somebody who he really refines his strains all his products are refined like he's been doing this for years and last thing I got was a bag of blue shrimp all right sorry red shrimp and these are the fire Reds some of them as they're cold or stressed I should say they actually don't feel cold they feel about room temperature have like a blue sheen to them and so that's probably the line that keeps them ultra like when when they are alone I bet they will color back to a redder color than this color but they're still super red I mean they're almost some of them are almost as red as that red line which is nuts and they have these won Best in Show at the shrimp shrimp cup and then I can't remember but they won Best in Show and that's incredible and all that very insulated to heat packs sends it out a priority so what what a cool dude I'm so excited about this we are gonna have these blue dreams they're gonna be going in their own tank all alone and you know these these uh these kings collection which are rainbow and lers and it looks like I got a fright ooh they're gonna probably go in with the blue dreams for now and I need to make them a rawhide but for now we're gonna do that now a word on these bags is so with these they actually have oxygen X exchange so you can put them into another bag and you can they let oxygen in and co2 out which is really cool so you can fill them take up less space plus the fish don't get sloshed around quite as much so I mean everything the way he packed this stuff is just pro to the max so when you acclimate these bags you don't necessarily just plop them in the water unless you're gonna do that really quickly but rather you over time you can put them in a new container and you can do a half and a half and then a drip method into another container so that's kind of when it rolls or you can risk shock but I wouldn't I wouldn't so yeah thank you so much Lucas breaths if you want to check out his his critters and you know what let me just show you some of the existing critters that I have of his so these end lers here those are his the ones you can buy online right now at lrb aquatics calm you can check out his youtube channel it is one of the most informational mad-scientist crazy monk fish Jesus as they call him just for his looks channels but these are the beautiful rainbow and tiger and lers and these I've kind of started breeding into more leopard variety with a spade tail and green on them with the yellow so I'm starting to get more pastels and things but he sent me a whole new route of stuff to play with they're gonna have to switch spots with this orange stripe endler and in here we have the Panda shrimp sorry Boop nd that's what is in the other bags but in here we have the the new shrimp that I just got the Bob Alti shrimp there's only a couple in here right now there's like four in here and then there's some killifish so what I think I'm gonna do since there's only a pair of the Royal rainbow tiger and lers over here let's see these guys I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do this long term because I don't want the bag to swell or them to suffocate but I just want to show you in the water the quality of these fish so they're gonna color up but that's going to be an amazing fish you can already see the markings on those fish just freakin incredible and what I can do is I can leave the females in with it if I want but I think I'm gonna just allow these two to be and see what happens first because that should be quite amazing so yeah I'm just gonna let them acclimate for a few minutes because the waters almost spot-on actually so we'll let them acclimate for a few minutes and then in like ten minutes or something we're gonna well switch them out the shrimp I'm going to be doing a drip acclimation but you can just see that he just hooked it up with the shrimp they are incredibly beautiful and not a single single one passed away which I don't know how he did that I honestly don't and these yellows they're even coloring up as we speak they're some sort of secure yellow maybe they're not the golden backs but he said these have the yellow really gene in them hidden latent so very cool looks like there's eight at least one two three four five six seven eight nine ten I'm counting ten in there all with plants and then this I'm really happy to have this to it'll go in the tank that's going to be Lucas's tank right there and this is all a mess pardon me because today was the big sale and I sold thirty different items at auction this is about unboxing Lucas's stuff but just so you can see how I'm going to reorganize and since these are Lucas's critters over here so I'd show you those but then I got these boop indi cribs that are gonna be living in here and then up here we've got the Japanese blue and lers and blue grass Guppies which will have a whole lot of moly way cribs these are pelvic a chromis tinny oddest moly way these were $6 or $8 for all of these they're usually 40 bucks a pop at the store and then up here I think we'll do the yellow shrimp up up up in this smaller tank plus today I got this tank so we could do one of my older healthier stocks might be able to just hop into this tank like instant filter it and I've still got bright well substrate to keep the pH lower so thank you so so much Lucas it's very awesome go to lrb aquatics

looking for a new mattress. It's time to find the perfect mattress for\nyou. If so, you probably come across two of the\nmost popular types of mattresses -- memory foam and hybrid. Today I want to talk about what exactly is\na memory foam mattress and what is a hybrid mattress, who should get one over the other,\nand which one is the right one you. First, I want to say Casper financially supported\nthis video and also sent me this great Casper Hybrid mattress to try out. I was a big fan of this mattress and big thank\nyou to Casper here. Now, let's talk about memory foam versus hybrid. Memory foam is made out of the polymer called\npolyurethane. You're going to find this material in objects\nlike car seats, sofas and, more importantly, like today, mattresses. Memory foam has this soft, slowly moving quicksand\nfeel. You slowly sink into the mattress. A hybrid mattress, on the other hand, is going\nto have soft, comfort layers on top, or some type of foam comfort layer on top. That could be latex, could be memory foam,\nor a blend of the two, or some other type of poly foam. Beneath that, you have supportive coils. For example, I'm on the Casper Hybrid right\nnow. You have a couple layers on top. You're going to have a latex-like foam, layer\nof memory foam beneath that, and a zone transition layer beneath that. Beneath that all, you're going to have your\nsupportive coil. That is a hybrid construction. What are the differences between a memory\nfoam mattress and a hybrid mattress? First off, it's going to be in the construction. Memory foam mattresses, as we're talking about\ntoday, is going to be an all foam mattress. A hybrid mattress, on the other hand, is going\nto have coils and the coils are going to make it very, very different. First thing it's going to do is it might dry\nwith the price just a little bit. In general, a hybrid mattress is going to\ncost more than an all foam mattress, than a memory foam mattress. This isn't always true, but it usually is. It's going to do a couple things for your\nhybrid mattress and it's definitely worth that extra investment. First off, it's going to make it more supportive,\nso it can handle heavier weight. It's also going to make it more durable, make\nit a longer-lasting mattress. You pay more money upfront, but it should\nlast for a longer amount of time. Hybrid mattresses is also going to be more\nbreathable in general than memory foam mattresses. Last, but not least, ease of mobility. With memory foam mattresses, I've had this\nexperience where I sink in too far. I am stuck, I can't move at all. With hybrid mattresses, you have less chances\nof that happening. With the coils, they don't let you sink in\ntoo far. The mattresses are usually more responsive\noverall. It's easier to move around in general. What are the benefits and drawbacks of memory\nfoam? First off, memory foam is great with pressure\nrelief. You slowly sink into the mattress. You feel a little pressure on your joint in\nyour key areas. It's also awesome in handling motion transfer. If you sleep with a partner, you get up in\nnight to go to the bathroom, your moving shouldn't disturb them. Off of that as well, memory foam is not a\nnoisy mattress. We don't have coils in the mattress, it doesn't\nsqueak. If you do move around at night, you shouldn't\ndisturb yourself or your partner. At the same time, there are some drawbacks. First off, memory foam is known for trapping\nheat. This is a big issue for me. I'm a hot sleeper. Lying down on top a memory foam mattress,\nit traps my heat, directs it back at me and I overheat at night, wake up sweaty and clammy. Not always a great experience. It's also sometimes harder to move around. Memory foam is not always the most responsive. You can feel stuck in your mattress. I've also had this experience. Last, but not least, memory foam is not always\nthe most durable material. Depending on the density of memory foam, it\nmay sag more quickly than a hybrid mattress. Definitely something to consider. What are the benefits and drawbacks of hybrid\nmattresses? First off, hybrid mattresses are very breathable. You have coils at the bottom there allows\nfor more airflow, shouldn't trap so much heat as memory foam, shouldn't sleep so hot. In addition, they're going to be more supportive. The coils add some serious support to the\nmattress, should be able to handle heavier weights than a memory foam mattress. At the same time, you have a soft comfort\nlayer on top. It's going to be a good balance of comfort\nand support. For instance, with the Casper Hybrid here,\nsome soft comfort layers on top, beneath that supportive coils. Good for all three sleeping positions. Finally, durability. The coils are going to add some serious life\nto your mattress. They may cost a little bit more upfront, but\nit should last for a longer amount of time. In term of hybrid drawbacks, first off, you\nhave price. In general, hybrid is going to cost more than\na memory foam mattress. You have coils in the mattress as well, and\ncomfort layers on top. You're getting more out of it, but it might\ncost more upfront. In addition, it can be more cumbersome. Hybrid mattresses can be heavier than the\nstraight memory foam mattresses. Whether you're moving your mattress across\nthe room, across town or across the country, it might be more difficult. Hybrid mattresses aren't always as good at\nhandling motion transfer. If you do move around at night, your partner\nmight feel more of your movements on hybrid mattress. Right now, you might be wanting to say, \"Marten,\ntell me which one I should get.\"I can't tell you exactly which one to get, but I can give\nyou some hints. With memory foam, first off, if you want to\nslowly sink into your mattress, feel that quicksandy slow moving feel, memory foam is\ndefinitely right for you. It's more like you're sleeping in the mattress\nversus on top. If you like that, definitely check out memory\nfoam. In addition, it's usually a better fit for\nside sleepers. I'm a side sleeper. I love lying down on a memory foam mattress,\nslowly sinking in, feeling the pressure melt away in my shoulders and my hips. Side sleepers, those with pain issues, definitely\ncheck out memory foam. Also in general, memory foam mattresses are\ngoing to save you some money. They're usually priced lower than a hybrid\nmattress. If you don't want to spend quite so much money\nupfront, definitely check out memory foam. Last, but not least, if you sleep with a partner,\nmemory foam in general is better at cutting out a motion transfer. Whether you or your partner move around a\nlot at night, you go to the bathroom a lot at night like I do, you shouldn't wake up\nyour partner so much on a memory foam mattress. Who should pick a hybrid mattress? If you prefer to sleep on top of your mattress,\nyou don't want to sink in quite so far, with a hybrid mattress, you usually sleep more\non top. There's also more bounce to the hybrid mattress,\nso you have less chance of getting stuck. If you're usually worried about mobility issues,\nyou get stuck in your mattress a lot, this happens to me on memory foam, hybrids are\nusually better at addressing this issue. In addition, a hybrid mattress usually features\na better balance of comfort and support. The support of coils and the comfort of those\ntop layers as well. That makes it a better match for all three\nsleeping positions. On your back and your stomach, you get the\nsupport there. On your side, the comfort layers give you\nsome good pressure relief as well. It's also a better match for hot sleepers. In general, you have more airflow from the\ncoils. You don't heat up quite so much as you do\non a memory foam mattress. And then there's durability. In general, a hybrid mattress is going to\nbe a more durable than the memory foam mattress. The coils add some serious durability. While you spend some more money upfront, it\nshould be a better long-term investment. It's also a good match for heavier people. I'm a larger person, I have more support needs. I'm 230 pounds. If you're my weight or larger, definitely\ncheck out a hybrid mattress. By now you should know which one is right\nfor you, a memory foam mattress or a hybrid mattress. If you want some more help, I'd definitely\ncheck out mattressclarity.com.

going so today I got a kingpin Blue Dream it's a TV car so let's talk about this but before I start the video if you are not the legal age to smoke in your area please click away from this video please don't watch it it's not meant for you audio so it comes in a box like this I can't blue trade all those numbers I don't care about the California thing like on everyday packaging cannabis fake cartridge more [ __ ] no one cares about and then here it's talking about like date that it was made and all that I don't believe it an expiration date so yeah let's open it so there's a sticker that's supposed to be up here but I took that out for the video cuz you know I can i film money all right I can only open use a woman so that's the box that covers this just flip that over take that out what his peace out pop all right my bad the camera cut off put basically just take the cartridge out to you know these two bevor plugs right here [ __ ] I can't pull this off there we go that's there I won't be using the views five it's compatible with this cartridge and I'm actually really like this battery let's look at this wax so as I can see it moves kind of fast I mean kind of slow kind of fast so I do I'd say it's pretty fast but at least four you know all this [ __ ] is portraying doesn't seem like a good quality oh my god so I just took a bunch of hits off this card but I'm gonna take like one or two for the video sake real quick so yeah cheers by the way all right so let's talk about these cars hi guys so I'm here with the cart where do you tell you know I feel about the car and then I'll talk about campaign after but the cart you know with all the stickers and labels on you're making it seem so legit the wax isn't the quality that I would have expected it to be when I'm talking about quality I mean like how runny it is like this it's gonna shoot to the top in like ten seconds where normal wax it would probably take like a minute to get to the top even longer depending on the wax so you know it's probably just some liquefied wax or even said of like the distillate which is what it's supposed to be this to it but like it's it's okay though I'm at like a 7 out of 10 high it's strong and it tastes good so my hating all right someone's talking about kingpin the actual company it's a real brand but these are knock-offs especially if you're in the legal state but if you're not getting it from the dispensary it's definitely a knockoff unless it's really expensive because the suspensory kingpins are pretty expensive but you know don't trust any of these stickers and labels like it's literally August and it says that this was made in February so that's how you know that this isn't dispensed we're just gonna [ __ ] keep it in sponsor me for that long so just don't trust these but don't trust these to be real cards but I would say that most king pens are pretty fire so I'm gonna pass King pan I'm gonna say you can trust them for a decent high

it's just it's really good really nice cannabis trichomes says it on the box Keith Richards go get it you", "lULIkkPgnEY": "today it's time for another review hold on gotta get my trusty pad over here doing today my review is of the green dream or just green dream it's a 4 gram off hot health so i don't think i've had it yet so i don't know what to expect but it's a hybrid it's a hybrid but it's a 50 50 hybrid so i guess it's not really so it's you know right down the middle right down the middle uh as it says 50 sativa 50 indica thc is 23 to 24 affects creative energizing euphoria happy sociable lift uplifting flavors aromas blueberry earthy fruity skunky sweet yeah definitely getting a fruitiness off there i wouldn't say blueberry but see there aren't really a lot of nice big buds in there it's just like a little bunch of little small ones so it's kind of hard to show you a nice big one they're all just really tiny but i got my thing vape vape all warmed up here so i usually get a lot of 5050 hybrids it's usually like a hybrid of a higher percentage of either of either wow the fruitiness i get on the exhales surprising definitely a sweetness to it okay so it's 50 50 but only in the explanation it says it's a sativa dominant hybrid oh my gosh the cross between blue dream and green crack oh green crack is nuts so i don't know if that one's going to give me the boost his name is attributed to the fact it has a mild taste of green tea i guess i don't know green tea doesn't really have a greatest taste used predominantly for stress this out of body experience can also help with depression as well green dreams aroma resembles a musky and earthy tone similar to wet soil a citrus undertone that spices up the overall flavor [Music] it does have a lot of flavors to it it's like i can taste a bit of the fruitiness a bit of the earthiness a quick acting strain there is a change in sensory perception sharper external stimuli visual distortion and a shift in cognitive thinking a great option to enhance brainstorming and working on creative projects recommended for those looking for a boost in the morning and best consumed during the day so i don't get why it says 50 50. how is it a sativa dominant if it's equally both i don't know i can't remember if i bought it for four grand boxy graham when i was a but you know what considering this is my the first bowl of this type and the vapor production is already getting a little down i mean that's what happens if you buy a four dollar gram right i guess yeah so graham was four bucks if you got an eighth it would come with 13 bucks that's not bad for an eighth though i asked where to go these options weren't there when i ordered off here a week ago it's so annoying i could don't i hate ordering gram per gram so annoying may relieve add adhd bipolar disorder chronic pain depression fatigue assign your migraine stress uh maybe i put too much in the bowl but maybe if i stuff the bowl too much it's it's hard to get the best vapor out of it but i mean this is a new bowl and well it's gone out now but i should have been getting bigger clouds than that had my cat in a little kitty cage for a second she was jumping all over the camera but i let her out because i felt bad so green dream definitely it started out with a bit of a almost four o'clock in the nose started out with a bit of a i don't know i was a little down i'm not down but you know what i mean tired out or whatever so it gave me a bit of a boost like like you would but it's not like caffeine it's a different kind of boost and it'll wear out and i'll probably be tired see there's a table shaking my cat's on the table knocking stuff over but you know what it's a good daytime wait but if you can get a better version of it like because i'm not saying i'm not totally saying order it from here but green dream is good if you get a better version four dollar grams are cheap but they're not good enough i'm a bit of a baked but you know i'm a bit of a baked what do you think of my new avengers sweatshirt pretty sure when i wash this once this is going to all fall off that's it for me i'm gonna turn off now before my cat eve

experience I've smoked it all from crappy brick Mexican we transported over the portals in the bed of diesel gas tanks you still smell the diesel on it back in the day now to California's wonderland of dispensary strains so today I've got in store for us four strains we've got the first one packed already it's called purple monster this is the indica that I purchased the good ending I got one good indica one good hybrid one gets teeth and I got El Chapo which is also I refer to as el cheapo this is the cheap we got a quarter of that as bolstering weed as they call it it's good weed it's just not fancy okay so let's try the purple monster here again an indica [Music] okay it's got kind of a camp dog taste to it but planty it doesn't taste very floral it doesn't anything like that it's got kind of a a sharp slightly acrid taste to it I have to pull another bowl as far as I've got I get a little bit of sweats a little bit tingle on the forehead that's a good sign it means it's fairly high THC at least it's not dabs or anything but it gets the job done the buds you can see right here it's not the densest bud in the world it's kind of like segmented off a lot as is the case with less dense we at least it's not stringy though so the parts that the segments are dense it's just not as tense as like super super dense bud that has no come like chunking off sections so okay this is pretty stony I can actually feel the first bomb are still affecting me a little bit so let's try second one and make sure we've got the this thing down purple monster yeah like a lot of indie guys you're not gonna get much from the taste department from indicas in general if you want taste and smell where's your team is that's guy that's good good dip smoke to it peasant it's heavy Long's a little coffee it's not really it's not really heavy its court of a curtain coffee but you know the old saying you don't coffee you don't get off now this is the Blue Dream this is top-shelf blue dream so it's the high-quality Blue Dream I don't historically like blue dream but this smells good they tried to fool us with their super Blue Dream which was just the same exact lead same plants but they just put all the bigger buds in one jar didn't fool me didn't pull you either smaller budget just as good this is the top-shelf Blue Dream let's see how it tastes there should be a higher good tasting one because this is teyla okay dancer is the first thing to note the weeds a little little moister it's got kind of a jack flavor to it which is another sativa tastes like Jack you're super Jack but not as strong doesn't have as clear as the stevia flavor it's clear Jack flavor but it definitely I would say comes from the jack family of sativas it's good I like it I mean this this is gonna be like my favorite one to smoke I like it's hi to mixes well with the purple slice a for lasses old favorite I haven't had in a while which is private reserve gorilla glue if this is a private super gorilla with four is what I would hope but it doesn't look quite like it it's not a stringy as perverse or grill glue for is which is a weirdly stringy strain where the glue is one of the odder hybrid varieties and that's why I like it a lot it gets you high in ways that other kind of weed doesn't really seem to do I'm already sweating from the blue and the purple let's try the gorilla glue private reserve is a specific brand of gorilla glue of course consistent with grows with it's tough to pull through I think that's why they call girl glue it sticks when you're trying to pull it through a drop bowl yeah that's good this is good purpose or grill ooh this is the [ __ ] that you go oh [ __ ] yeah I got a good one this time this is good stuff this is by far the best of the three it's got that weird gorilla glue punch to it that's not like any other strain it's a really unique strain they were real girls with or guru glue number four is even more like that that's the best one that's the Cannabis Cup winner I used to get that up at Foothill there's a dispensary up there that had it and man that [ __ ] was great but this is pretty great too see hard that's it it's bull through high road taste is really just thing to do okay so that's my recommendation for today's string thing there I'm not a huge fan of blue dreams hi in general this one's good and it's got a great taste braid Jackie as I said the purple thing is fine whatever purple master I wouldn't get it again you know I get kind of bored of [ __ ] Kim dog og indicas there was just too many different variants so ignore that stay away from the cams and the oh geez anyway I would say in general unless I got something looks pretty girly dank and of course lastly go with the grill if you find nothing in Korea loop by anytime you won't regret it it's fantastic any comments from these simple personages regarding the marijuana strains your own experience with any of these strains or comparable strange I'm just gonna say up here Blue Dream is so abundant that it's basically like $100 ounces like they're just I don't know it's kind of like the non offensive like mainstream kind of but up here and people are smoking it all the time it's it's like it's generally non offensive but it's not particularly like something to write home about you know it's well I will say this about the Blue Dream is top-shelf allah dream is different than a standard blue dream in general I normally don't ever get it because I think regular old Blue Dream is I've had it before it's just been like not even hard we got me high so I don't like it but this looked particularly good it was top-shelf and when I realized it was the same as the super Blue Dream except just smaller buds and five bucks cheaper I was like you know what I'm gonna get that because that does look like particularly good blue dream and if in a while since I gave it a shot I'm gonna give a shot so that's the other person I got it but yeah I'm not a huge Blue Dream fan if I'm gonna get a sativa I like to get super jack a jack a prayer berserk jack is really good but that's interesting to hear that that's a popular strain so you are on the East Coast no I'm in Colorado row in Colorado okay so it's like on a corporate so it's like they got big warehouses growing blue dream you know and they kind of just unmask it's like I found more expensive in Colorado than California well it's things have started to get a little it said like people are getting up to scale you know and they're starting to be able to turn out hundred-dollar ounces on on a regular basis but it's not the highest quality right it's like mid-shelf if you're lucky kind of okay interesting well that's why I got out cheapo but even this is still 60 1/4 which is kind of fright the place I'm going to right now is pricey though okay I go someplace else get good deals like Foothill they sometimes have $100 or $120 ounces sometimes they'd have like $8 1/2 or something like that or $70 house or something but I don't know it's far away I'm lazy let's try the El Chapo that tastes like ol to assess you know it's like good ol straight-up smoke it all day a Mexican weed but it's got it's got a cake to it sure got some spiciness to it all right anyway any other comments on the marijuana and such I'm curious if you've ever had rain since a star since a star yeah oh one second hi Kimberly can I call you back in about three minutes I'm just at the end of a video I'm making right now and I'd like to finish it up real quick all right thank you sit but so okay what do you say it was called Oh since a star I just linked a thing in the chat so you could take a look I've been looking for it up here but barely anyone grows that I've never gotten a chance to and I heard it was grown in California so I was just wondering if you'd ever had it all right it doesn't sound familiar I wonder what it's related to since I start I've heard really good things about it it's very cerebral almost like psychedelic kind of hmm yeah anyway sure get a chance you should try and pick some up if I see that well you know I get a lot of these branded like like Private Reserve is a strain brand I guess you'd call it so since a star has been around before all the all of that it's all right well you know I have my own favorite older one and they had told you about it before it's Northern Lights mm-hmm Hannah's Grove with number four unfortunately I don't have that hasn't like that one I think I've got girl remember whatever nothing nothing but you know the place I linked you is really poor description I found a better one on wiki leaf it actually gives you a bit more data I don't like Larry oh gee that's not good I think I get it ones of it anyway God's gift they had this at the dispensary today it was expensive though salic the sneeze cop those yeah sort of it was either a snuffer key Chinese I'm not sure tried sketches an indica strains staggering 27 percent to suit is a potent offspring of granddaddy purple and OG Kush which explains pain relief revenues exceptional flavor so if you it says here that the since a star was created by the crew at Paradise seeds and they have not released the full truth of the strange genetics they have stated that it is mostly Afghani indica but the strain most definitely contains some sativa in her lineage in her lineage so it's a mystery it's very mysterious hmm interesting these are interesting things well you get a lot of Girl Scout cookies around here that's very coming with that go Scout cookies that is oh is that a strain yeah is it strain it's funny you guys don't really you don't even it's all over it's probably like blue dream is over there you know except you get lots of little variants of it you know Girl Scout cookies you'll get I think I've actually seen it before I think I've ever gotten it though maybe yeah real good Girl Scout cookies is very flavorful and very whatever yes you want to say okay I gotta call Kimberly back so I'm gonna stop this video and thanks for watching and I got a little distracted here I forgot for a second we're doing a video for donuts always but I've been smoking some of these wonderful strains I suggest you enjoy them as well if you're in a state where that's legal and you are of age of course I wouldn't want anybody working any critically important very respected laws so thanks for watching and don't forget to eat plenty of cheese", "1HSpJIIo8Vs": "hey everybody welcome to the secret history living in your aquarium what I wanted to show you this is a sad sight we have a mama shrimp of Lucas Brett's blue dreams that has passed away but I wanted to show you something here it's kind of interesting I don't know what killed it it was in the prime of its life but one you can really see those little grabber claws that are pink you see that too you can see that my panda loach wants to eat it no but what I wanted to show you is the color of its shell so on the outside you see that blue color that's its actual exoskeletons color and it's its flesh right under its exoskeleton whereas the flesh under the exoskeleton that's not part of it there are several layers is a pink color now in in Bloody Mary shrimp this color is actually blood-red rather than this salmony pink cream kind of color so my point being is that even blue shrimp have this this color pigmentation thing going on and you'll only notice this sorry guys about the focus you'll only notice this a few hours after the shrimp dies this color thing going on and before all of the scavengers including other shrimp start eating the flesh out from there you can see on the back of the tail hold on in the back of the tail where they've actually started eating away at that just like you would when you have shrimp and shrimp cocktails so this probably happened a few hours ago but the color disappears pretty quickly when they when they die so it's just interesting that some sort of pigment that is does not last long it needs them to be consciously flexing these layers in the the skin and that's why they can change to from darker to lighter you see the the normal color they are up here and it's just kind of one of those weird things about shrimp about neo caridina shrimp is they have the the odd pigment of their shell which is a phenotype that means it's it's the physical appearance of the shrimp as it's been bred and then underneath usually that flesh stays the same color or you can't see it except for on snowball shrimp or really or Riley as they say shrimp and in those you can see through and so they actually need to be selected for clear flesh underneath there if you want them to be high-quality and so here you can see what you would get in a cherry shrimp or a blue dream shrimp this being a blue dream if it changed color like if it had babies and the color change was to Riley you'd end up with this pink color first and you'd have to select for clear and clear flesh but you can also see that the tail right in here even though some of it's been eaten they're chewed on up here is prime area to be clear to have that clear color and that's why you see the Riley's or really shrimp have the clear patch right there behind the main plate of armor up on the head where the tail starts the last thing I wanted to point out is just you can see the sections and how these are invertebrates meaning they have exoskeletons and their spine is on the outside basically it sits it's on the on the shell portion that comes off of their of their body so kind of an interesting look kind of sad kind of a bummer but such is the circle of life and I will fish this shrimp out just in case it's sick but I'm assuming it got stressed or something along those lines and it's not sick I hope if it's sick it could spread to the other shrimp and you want to get about but I swear just us even looking right now it's losing more blue color every second and so I'm going to get it out of there soon it will be a colorless life form you will notice also that just like crabs shrimps other other invertebrate when they cook them when you cook them in things the flesh turns like a pinky color and it's gooey and like liquidy like crab legs if you crack them open while they're alive whereas when they when it's cooked it it's more of a firm texture so invertebrates shrimp crabs things like that snails kind of interesting how they work you can kind of see here the blue but imagine that pink underneath and that actually determines a lot of which colors stand out let's see where's where where is that shrimp I was just looking at that actually determines a lot of how dark the blue dream is gonna be so if that color is a darker pink it will have a darker blue body whereas if it's a clear color or a whiter color that under flesh then you'll get more of like a crystal colored like a blue velvet rather than a blue dream shrimp so just thought I'd point that out and as I said the blue is leaving us as we speak so good timing all right guys if there's more ship dying in here I'll let you know what's up with that but I just thought that this was a good opportunity to show a little bit about the layers of pigment inside a shrimp all right guys please like subscribe and hit that bell when you do subscribe if you'd like to see more of this tank in the shrimp and the panda loaches and the baddest and breeding all three together in this funky low-tech tank that needs a scraping actually the scraping will be by the Loach's alright guys I will talk to you later and

the channel alright guys talk to you later right", "DDDThQdXslQ": "hey guys Alexander Williamson here with the secret history inside your aquarium so we're gonna talk about the history of selective breeding for red cherry shrimps blue velvet shrimps yellow sakura green jade pearl blue blue pearl red really or Riley shrimp all sorts of different shrimp everything other than the caridina and the the bee and the bolt shrimps and the tiger shrimps that are popular in smaller scale aquaria so first of all let's go over where they came from so in the wild yes cherry shrimp do exist but not as vivid if you can see here they've done a pretty good job showing that they may have red but traces of that kind of dusty brick brick red or rust red and in the wild there are three phenotypes or I guess visual types of shrimp that come from primarily Taiwan in Southeast Asia and these are our near neo caridina david ige and there are those three wild types basically we've got your your chocolates and your darker colors and then you've got your deeper blacks and grays and then you've got your lighter rusty and tan colors now outside of that neo caridina David eyes there's also Nia caridina palmata which is another wild type and it has given us some variants including some strong yellows and some greens and a lot of the Pearl varieties which are kind of an opalescent color and that has to do with a couple different things so first of all when you have a shrimp as I've talked about in other videos you've got flesh color and you've got the exoskeleton or shell color and when they molt of course they they leave behind as little of nutrients as as possible and so some of that color gets reabsorbed but you'll probably find a clear shell or a lightly colored shell yet the shrimp when you see it has a new shell grown underneath and that has color but in between oftentimes when they're breaking open you can see if their flesh is that color and also on their legs and antennae and in their face sort of so essentially those genes were hidden long ago for millions of years in these wild types and these wild types in order to make a brown color believe it or not you actually need to have a lot of different colors present so as you can see from what people have learned selective breeding wise is that the colors that this light tan brown include are clear so it has a clear shell to let different light show through and then it also has some white in there and it has some blue in there and some yellow and it may also have green in there naturally that could be a mutation we don't know for sure but likely it has those colors in its chromatophores so it has white black green red and blue and possibly yellow as its as its colors to make up brown just like if you took your paints and you mix them all up and they turn into like a mess of brown so surprisingly these too many boring looking wild shrimp have the most potential the brown ones and the kind of like convoluted colored ones because they carry those genes in order to make that brown now what happens is in the wild if they were to mutate and turn bright yellow there's a good chance they'd get eaten right away and you see here that they would have to mutate yellow or orange and then to the green so they're not gonna just flip from the wild species to a green randomly or a green jade so that's why we don't find them like that in the wild you do find blue in the wild occasionally and same with lobsters this is common in the you know in the invertebrate world and that's because the red and blue are really potent and common chromatophore colors that they use as a base in their their active camouflage and their lifelong camouflage so shrimp can change color against their background in their setting and they can turn lighter or darker and what that means is putting more color into their cells on their flesh or on their shell and they flex it so that they are pulling it taut and they've spread that pigment out across the cell and that cell is called a chromatophore and there's layers of these cells and when you see a red shrimp for instance it probably only has blue and yellow and red chromatophores at this point it has been selected for that and that's why you're seeing those intense colors so your your if you look here on this chart you'll see that you know a red shrimps not going to jump straight to a green shrimp if you have them living together and breeding but there is a chance you know that that if you cross it with really or a Riley shrimp you can get a blue Riley and then end up with the blue jelly but really what you need to do is you need to go to these darker types and that since they're darker there's actually blue in there if you took your if you were on your computer and you took a your color dropper in paint or Photoshop you would see that gray like that is made up of blues and reds and other colors blacks and whites and so even though these darker shrimps in the wild look like a gray color if you separate out the colors that we're looking at almost like pixels that's where you're getting these really vivid blue shrimp in the Neo caridina David eye brown type the chocolate type seems to throw the most and then there's the Neo caridina David eye there's also the gray or dark coloured shrimps and they throw the carbon relays and they throw black and deep deep blue they throw the gold black here that you can see but they're not gonna throw any of these colors and so these are your main evolutionary pillars and so when you're looking at this chart we all know that cherry shrimp are the most common and and kept and they have become the most Hardy because they have been bred so many times in different conditions and they are one of the first throws from the wild they are one of the first mutations from the wild and they can be kept whereas in the wild a bright red shrimp probably isn't the best idea in a little quiet stream with probably gray or tan colored rocks and greenery in the background that is just waiting to get munched on so that's why in the wild you will see them but rarely and they're not gonna be vivid that needs to be selected for over time and so what you're doing is you're getting rid of some of the other color variations that are hidden in their latent gene pool so they may have had an ancestor way back that was another type of shrimp and it may have had yellow it may have been yellow and maybe that fit like living on sulfur vents or something like that deep in the ocean or in a cave or something and it retains that information inside and that is like a recessive hidden gene and then whereas the dominant genes the red hop out really quickly so from there when you breed them with more shrimp that have that red it is a dominant trait and it ends up taking over now if you have two shrimp that are red and they have a really dark red then you've either selectively bred them together over and over just taking the ones that are the darkest and you end up with these red fire painted grades that the S the SS the Sakura Reds the red Taiwan fire Sakura Singapore but interestingly here the chocolate colored wild shrimp or Shoko which is one of the first ones that was kept by hobbyists it suddenly through the formal chocolate shrimp which is a darker Brown and it through Bloody Mary and the interesting thing about Bloody Mary is it skips all of this refinement because it's flesh is actually red so not just the shell the flesh and the shell are dark dark red and because of that red and blue are in the same spectrum very frequently to give that vivid red because you've got kind of a yellowish orange color that is a primary color that gives you red if you look on a color wheel red is the primary color but to make a red a darker red there's no such thing as darker red what you're doing is you're adding in genes for blue and if you add too much it turns purple but if you add just the right amount it's this deep crimson red and the same thing can happen over here but it gets a little more convoluted so really all if you have a blue shrimp blue dream blue topaz blue carbon or Riley really shrimp the really or Riley shrimp what that is is that's a lack of pigment so you can have a lack of pigment in the shell and in the flesh and then you can also have color and a lack of pigment in one of those places if it's on the shell you're not gonna see the flush but so you have clear shell and clear flesh and then you have color together and that's what we consider a really or a Riley shrimp so I just wanted to give you a rundown by looking at this you can study this yourself and you know pause it and look at it and see what's bred from what but for neo caridina shrimp there are only three real wild types if you count Neo caridina Pal Matta some of them get bred into but really all of these shrimps are coming from three different types in the wild and that's like a lighter tan brown and a dark brown and then like a dusty dark brown gray and black shrimp and so all those colors have been thrown from there and we have selectively bred it so it's pretty cool to see how far this has come as far as people breeding some things are unexpected like why would you expect orange to throw a green variance well we know that that Orange has yellow in it so yellow plus a little bit of blue which is also clearly hidden in the ancestry sometimes an orange will throw a blue or a green I should say and that's odd you know sometimes you can see it happening here so clearly there's something going on in there chromatophores and color in their flesh the pigment that allows that jump to occur and it's not jumping though straight from red to green so we're eliminating that darker red which then allows the green to show rather than having it turn out brown so sometimes you can screw up when you're breeding and it'll revert back to a wild type looking it'll look muddied or it'll only be patchy spots and that's because it has all this history in its in its bloodline so I just wanted to give you that quick rundown and have you look at this great little chart it's been put out by a couple different people and I just thought that maybe you'd get a kick out of that and that's a little bit of the history of the breeding it started really in this late 60s early 70s in Japan then it kind of spread to the US other than that I mean I'm sure there were hobbyists here and there who did that but really they collected wild-caught unique species and it was kind of a upper class thing to have a blue lobster or a blue little caridina shrimp and that was just kind of an anomaly but these yellows greens oranges soft blues those are colors that are getting thrown now more with our selective breeding as well as the patterns on them that's very selective breeding so that's an overview on kind of the history of it since the late 90s we've been getting these different variations open to the public and not just in close-knit hobbyist circles blue and red which makes sense because those colors get thrown the most in random mutations we're the first to hit the the hobby market and see them in big-box stores and as well as now later into the 2000s we're starting to see Jade and yellow some of those I've even seen at the the tangerines there's a lot of names people trying to come up with proprietary names when they breed something that they deem interesting or new and you have to be careful on what you think is what and that's the important part is say you have an orange Sakura and a yellow Sakura and you think they look the same they're pretty close okay so say you have a yellow shrimp and your goal is to get green shrimp out of it now you're gonna have a problem if you end up here these still have many forms they could revert to back up the line or even mutate into new forms that we yet to see but you're not gonna get the green jade and things like that from the same shrimp so you really need to know the history and the lineage of how it's been bred if you're hoping to do something specific now if you just want to keep colorful shrimp no problem just keep whatever you want mix them together and call or get rid of the ones that don't fit whatever it is that you're looking for so thanks for tuning in sorry that was a little long-winded but it's a big subject I'm gonna be talking about grading and also natural factors in the environment as well as chemical factors in their skin and if you want to know more about how shrimp change colors check out my other video on chromatophores and active camouflage vs. passive camouflage and thanks for tuning in if you stuck with me this long please like and subscribe it would greatly appreciate it and just like these little guys keep on swimming guys I'll talk to you next time bye", "n9Qi4YsY_8g": "all right so I have noticed that some of these shrimp look half malama half neo caridina and I am noticing that there is actually mounting and straddling going on here I don't know if this is some sort of territorial fighting type thing going on or if they're really actually interbreeding but what I wanted to show you was that this is a female with eggs ready to drop to the buried position and a neo caridina on a Malala caridina and if you take a look at some of my other shrimp let's take a look here and with the water reflecting I actually have one that's blue mallamma shrimp that has blue all around the edges which is interesting and I have all the shrimp this aged about the size of that one compared to these bigger ones they all have blue including this pregnant one has a blue band buy her eggs so we will find out soon hopefully whether the Molalla shrimp meloa shrimp actually can interbreed and hybridize with Neo Cardenas they normally carry this color I mean they have a range of colors but you see the orange you see the Browns and reds and this clear with the kind of galactic sparkly bits on them and the dots like this but then we also have these lower grade caridina neo caridina I should say that have spots and purpley eyes there's just as many of these juveniles in here see this with the very poor color quality compared to the parents so here is what they should look like right there there or back up in there there's one but I as much as it says it's not possible I'm starting to see look at these lower grade blues so that looks like a neo caridina that has some mala wa features on it which is interesting those dots the clarity and just kind of the head and shoulder placement and shape check this out the eyes being a bit bigger bulgy and having a pupil in the center whereas the other these other guys have just a black dot the Lucas brett's ones and you can see the patterning on their leg it's just at the joints where they get the blue I mean they're translucent blue but I've got this aperture cranked way up to show you guys the contrast and you can actually make out the blue you see that blue sheen in that one behind the neo caridina compared to the normal which is just I mean no you would not call that blue and again here we go looking at a traditional mating position placement going on so I don't know what's going on here and I would really love to hear anybody else's thoughts I have at least half a dozen pregnant female male shrimp here and we will see what happens so please like subscribe and click that bell look at that two of them are trying to do it so I think this is a mating thing these females are all carrying saddles and ready to drop the eggs into the Buried position and it's no accident that you're seeing both of these shrimp do this so very very interesting that we're watching this we're witnessing this and these ones are already I think half I believe these are half and I don't know if they are viable if they're a viable Malo or not if I would assume that they are not as most hybrids that that do that in the wild are not viable but perhaps they are I don't know maybe we're maybe we can expect a whole new line of shrimp's a new new hybridized species they are very similar so pretty exciting stuff going on in this research tank so as I said please like subscribe I do need to get a couple more tanks I want to keep things set aside buy some new stock if you want to help me with this project you guys will get first dibs on the offspring that I have here as well as future offspring if you would like to support me through patreon or super chats on live chats or even just PayPal or if you're not into the patreon thing a lot of people aren't right now so check this out this this is another one that has a very clear case of having blue all over our shell very clear blue hues in the show so yeah it's very interesting I don't know what to make of it quite yet but we'll see where this goes thanks for watching you guys let me know what secrets you have in your aquarium and I'll keep sharing mine take care of yourself your critters and have a great night I'll talk to you guys later", "YyUVQSVuDy8": "yo what is up everyone shout out to all my stoners out there worldwide shout out to you this videos for you guys this is a Apple DAB's review Blue Dream alright and I'm using the rose battery for this one this is how it looks now before anything guys before anything I've seen a good amount of these review cartridge videos and here's here's my thing about it when they recorded the videos gonna take like 20 to 30 minutes right recording that video and then box it and they put it on that battery and then they hit him and it said damn this is bomb that's what boy here's the reason why I'm not doing that because you couldn't beat high ass-fuck which I'm gonna say medicated for that time that you're recording it and then after you record it like 5 minutes later you're not medicated anymore alright so literally I was hitting this yesterday a good amount of times and I was medicated for at least 45 minutes with like five hits so after five hits of it I would be medicated for at least 45 minutes and if this takes bomb this tastes super bomb me actually does taste like a blue dream I've had two other cars that tasted both different from Blue Dream I'm like this is not Blue Dream what is this like no this is actually legit it literally does taste like a Blue Dream is it's a nice a nice beautiful citrusy flavor on this it tastes Bob and infused bomb you're not stuck like this doesn't give you a stuck high this gives you like a euphoric funny high like things are funny you know you're smiling and that's like one of my favorite types of highs like when you're just like literally relaxing everything feels good everything tastes good music freakin here's good and everything just feels good it just like this is why I like blue dream is one of my favorites because of that so like if you're looking for that kind of euphoric funny I like this is it like you're not gonna get stuck you're not gonna get stuck all right yeah but it's strong but it's not to the point where you like you cannot do anything no no so that's how much I was hitting yesterday and this bomb this is straight-up bomb so check how it looks right there tastes so bomb guys like the other the other cartridges you know they didn't taste as good I know I should've done a review about it but I was iffy about it but not now I'm gonna review everything now so these this is actually a legit company - it's not like one of those fake cartridges you know you follow on my Instagram they got like 500 followers and like this is actually a legit company they're based out of LA Venice so Venice Beach area I mean I mean but yeah and they're not like super big yet I know they've been out for a while but they're not like super big they're not super popular yet like steezy cuz I guess I don't know but this is how the inside looks out of it but you know you guys want to pause it and read that you know go ahead the packaging is dope dope dope though the ceilings dope as [ __ ] everything is dope about it like it tastes good like honestly like I'll give this a solid eight what I buy this again of course like yeah what and when when I picked this up there was a the other wax cartridges are OC far but you know I picked this out of that but they do have like a few selections I wanted I wanted said that the King Louie the thirteen have like 12 selections then I would post like I'm probably gonna post a link in the description if you guys I want to follow the page and if you guys want to order it if you're in Cali you know but honestly this is a dope-ass review like I legit [ __ ] with Apple dads I like jiff [ __ ] with this like there's actually fires bomb like like I said you can you can take five heat ten hits you know in that video and you're gonna be medicated as [ __ ] but then after the video like you have to keep hitting it this is like like this is it a weed pain like I know a lot of stoners get confused and they think this is like a weed pan they think this is a blunt like they keep hitting it and hitting and hitting it like dig this is stronger than a blunt this is stronger than that like take a few hits relax dawg relax this is strong this is good alright so honestly with five hits I was medicated for a good 45 minutes I didn't have to dude turn it on and take keep getting more hits only reason why I did that after you know was to try it out to see what would happen and yeah well like 10 hits I was good for it for a good two hours and it was it was good the quality is good like just this is just a high quality brand and this is like underrated and no I'm not getting paid for them no I do not know these people is just like man this [ __ ] is just fire now I will be reviewing all kinds of cards now alright so stay tuned let me know what you guys think let me know if you guys have these let me know guys shout out to every single one of you guys who are watching this shout out to all my stoners I [ __ ] with you guys heavy much love from Cali peace", "p4joBq4g6A8": "hey guys I'm posted I just picked up on a blue cart boom there you go yeah I'm gonna be reviewing it seeing how it is if it's good it tastes nice you know ever gets me high oh yeah get to it please sure you just pull this this came out today was a good day I only use a blue battery keep away from heat and Sun if clog of the Curie's detach the battery unit and help through the cartridge until the clog has been fully dislodged basically just how to use it I don't need this you hear that it's like Christmas right now okay I'm [ __ ] confused oh okay it was this side take that out boom so it's here let's go hopefully this is real you know some face shape but if it is Wow I guess it was 20 bucks that's pretty sketch but I was like I don't know maybe he's like running out well like nobody's really buying it I don't know why the [ __ ] it's 20 but Browns greens on boom I have this battery but I don't I forgot what it's called it's moving but very slowly I [ __ ] what they go oh it's pretty like yellow it looks like a like the KRT oil I don't know how I feel about that I didn't really like the Quixote's we're trying something new so let's go this battery I'm gonna show you guys how it works here's to like turn up the heat look at this 3.8 here's the power button / the hit button to like press it to take a you know whatever I'm over this review let's go see how it tastes it smells like sugar smoke like honey I'm scared what I'm smoking honey breath okay I'm just hitting it tastes like [ __ ] sugar that's what I'm saying like what the fight this should taste like sugar like I don't know something sweet sweet sweet sweet oh it's cool I've heard of these before though the Bloom cards this kid in my class he would always talk about it he got so high that off like one blinker he was like darling he could feel it as soon as he was hitting it and [ __ ] this one I don't know like I feel like you overhyped it I don't know if you were just excited or maybe I just got a fake one I don't know like I don't know what the situation is right now but because it doesn't taste like wax you know it tastes like sugar do you like I don't know how to explain it let me take another hey you know I'm tripping make sure you guys are smoking with me not this for you yeah that should taste sweet as food people like overall I don't really know how to feel about this I don't know if I got a rule one ever I would have got it from a dispensary I would have loved it pretty good card for like cheap you know but I got it from a plug so that makes it halis good just like so scared to sleep I just got it because it was 20 bucks and I was like dude like that kid was always talking about is a lip mac and B get it I'm asked for their opinions yeah they like yeah they like oh froley like keep smoking they don't like it I'll throw it away book that I'm trying to get what you could get from like smoking pesticides and [ __ ] probably [ __ ] bad you know probably overall just sketch about it because I got a funny play basically because you know what I mean I've never picked up from that play I don't know if it rings fake shit's not gonna wanted to get my reaction to be oh you guys all that Tennessee doesn't really see how much place we're presenting it whatever I'm over this review I don't like it was a waste 20 bucks and I saw it at the dispensary and probably get it though cuz you know I know that it's legit this

the time in the BC cannabis store and I just see it in the regular stores quite often this is blue rhino it's a hybrid but more dominant in the indica side of things so it will make you nice and relaxed it definitely has a stony kind of an effect to it because the THC levels are between 18 and 22 percent it's a lower CBD level but the the buds on this one are pretty nice they're not they're

there's quite a few little crystals in there a couple little red hairs just different things Oh on the nose it is very potent smelling this stuff so for being a medium level of THC it definitely has some skunky characteristics I am going to try and use just a little bit of this and just roll a nice nice little joint cuz I kind of keep that bud intact so we'll see what I can get out of this stuff it might fluff up we will see it seems to be grinding really well how's all you people doing out there give me some suggestions that you some different strains or different video ideas that you'd like to see I'm gonna start doing some different videos coming up that might be interesting so stay tuned I think you're gonna like them okay we're where are we going here oh I forgot to do something which I've been doing at the beginning of these videos lately but I'll roll this first it came out quite powdery actually and feels a little bit dry but that's okay sometimes that's a good thing sometimes hmm might not be a very big joint but I kind of want to save this little bud here share it with some friends so that's the other thing I want to just talk a little bit and we'll go we'll do a video about this just with marijuana etiquette it is rude I would say to not offer the joint you're smoking to people it's for sharing the more that you keep it like a treat it like a and a listen illicit substance then the more negative connotations are gonna come towards it and I'm not a fan of that like I know other drugs that are illegal and totally not cool like say cocaine it's interesting people that mm do cocaine it's like a very secretive thing where something like rolling a joint and passing it around in a circle or in your living room or with your friends or at a concert or wherever you are it's very just kind of a common thing I'm in British Columbia here so maybe it's a little bit different but I think that's kind of just something that people do okay here I'm gonna have a little taste of this mmm it's definitely got some citrusy notes on there a little bit of fruity flavors let's just do this one quick okay doesn't seem to wanna light there we go okay I'm just gonna have a couple puffs of this the flavor is nice and it's not excuse me it's not um what do you want to call it it's not very grassy so it's not doesn't have very much characteristics of like an outdoor it is definitely indoor strain you can tell by the way it's been manicured and they'll help how densely packed the bud is again on the flavor on the nose it's quite citrusy but you can tell there's a potency on there oh there's almost like a kind of chocolate upfront taste to it which is quite nice so like herbal not very grassy a little bit citrusy a little bit fruity there is some chocolate in there kind of like that um cocoa powder chocolate this one keeps going out and here I was thinking it was really dry like we would just burn up right away but maybe once I get this thing started will actually burn nicely but for now it doesn't seem to be one into light okay there it goes I'm gonna put this down let it do its thing so on the show lately I've been opening my advent calendar and I realized that I'm probably gonna end up having to just eat it all cuz I crave it so bad and it also kind of makes me have an obligation to do 25 videos this month and that just doesn't seem like something reasonable you want quality not quantity but for now we're on December 4th today I gotta find it on here why don't they put it all in a row there it is instead of hidden I guess it makes it like a game or something I don't know oh yeah we got a nice little lint chocolate here nothing better than a couple munchies when you've been smoking some pot I don't know you guys tell me what do you what do you prefer do you like sweets or do you like savory I I you know I like both you're crazy for both things but because people buy bags of chips and whatever but sometimes having a nice chocolate to go with it it instead of getting the pasties it like almost Reese elevates your mouth okay Oh creamy Center on this one I eat okay anyway don't have too much more to say about this again this is blue rhino it is a hybrid more dominant in indica moderate THC level this one at the government store was ten dollars a gram so it was lower on the scale which I tend to go for a lot these days because if you're comparing ten dollars a gram versus sixteen dollars a gram for the same kind of strain you're not really getting to too much benefit for spending that extra four to six dollars a gram just doesn't seem worth it to me especially when I've said this before but especially because on the street you used to be able to get a gram for about eight dollars and it's frustrating when you see the government try to come in and take it over and claim they're doing a good thing by getting it off the streets but in actuality they're just it's just a big [ __ ] money grab anyway that's okay I'd rather it be legal and have to pay a couple extra bucks then you know people getting in trouble for a little bit of herb that grows out of a plant in your yard you know doesn't make any sense to have a jail sentence for something like that anyway that's all I got to say today thank you for joining me I'm bud subscribe click like catch you next time", "qu3QSQjZD9A": "what's up guys I'm Jeff and today we're gonna be going over our teams list of the top ten best hybrid or coil mattresses so if you aren't super familiar with buying a mattress I wouldn't be surprised so that's why I'm here obviously and just so you know people kind of have their own definitions of what hybrid means all we're saying is that it's a combination of two different types of materials coils and foam so that's just an FYI also subscribers you will know this we have tested a ton of mattresses like way more than 50 mattresses and so I'm pretty confident this list is definitely gonna be very helpful for you we've obviously spent a lot of time testing beds researching beds sleeping on beds building our lists and I think this is gonna be the best place you can go for looking for the best mattress that has coils and is really supportive and that's really the main advantage of getting a coil or hybrid mattress as opposed to an all foam bed coils tend to be a lot more durable over the long haul they certainly are better for heavier people and so if you are in a genre or if you just really want your mattress to last a long time you probably want to look into a coil mattress that being said there are some pretty durable all foam beds that I think will last a long time it's just in general coil beds are better and speaking of beds all of the beds on this list are just in alphabetical order there that's how we laid them out alphabetical order now if you do enjoy the video and you find it helpful we obviously put a ton of time in this stuff so give us a thumbs up if you do find it helpful that always helps us out and we will do a much larger post for this video on our website so if you need any more details check down below in the description there's a lot of stuff you should look at down there including the link to our full post before this video I'm gonna rattle them off quickly I got 10 beds to get through plus honorable mentions so I'm just not gonna spend a whole lot of time on each one of them also if we do update this video which we probably will in the future check right here on the screen if there's a link click that that'll be our most up-to-date video if there's no link then you're in the right place alrighty now let's talk about bouncy beds okay so in terms of shipping returns warranties all of that stuff all the brands on this list offer completely free shipping so it's literally just gonna show up in your house some of them will show up in a box and you unroll them you get them all set up some will come with free White Glove delivery which just means a local delivery firm sets it up for you and you don't have to do anything there are pros and cons to both of them check our website for more information there a lot of them will offer a trial period so you can sleep on the bed for usually a minimum of a hundred nights to see if it's right for you keep in mind that all these beds will soften doesn't matter what type of bed you get will soften and change its properties a little bit over time or maybe a lot of it over time so don't judge the bed right away give it a few weeks think about the bed and then kind of wear it in for yourself that's why you have the trial period and clearly they're very confident in their products so they can afford to take back summer turns now speaking of returns a lot of the online brands will for completely free returns there's no catch you literally get your money back if you call them within that trial period some of them aren't completely free returns just make sure to check for more information there and then in terms are warranties get a bed with at least a 10 year warranty that's the bare minimum and speaking of bears bear hybrid is first on a list now I personally slept on this bed for a long long time like many many months and I love this mattress and if you ask my girlfriend Amelia I think if she had her druthers this would be the bed that she would pick for the next ten years she really likes this mattress so there's a lot of good things about it it does incorporate all different types of foams including some memory foam some proprietary phones and then it does have pocketed coils it's a little bit on the softer end kind of like a medium on the firmness firmness is subjective though if you're heavier it seems softer if you're lighter beds tend to feel firmer to you so just keep that in mind but yeah bear hybrid I really like it it's pretty affordable for a coil mattress out there and one thing that you probably won't love is that if you don't temperature regulate your house much or if you are a little bit heavier you may sink and more and warm up a little bit on the bed doesn't really have the most breathable cover the one thing I do really like is that it has a sealant cover sealants apparently is an FDA recognized wellness device it can increase blood flow restful sleep help with recovery I don't have any data on that I did sleep on bare mattresses for a while but you should check their website out or the sealians manufacturers to learn more about the material I just think it's kind of cool that they have it in the bed I do think this will be a very durable mattress and I'll have a review and I'll find a coupon code and have that in the description as well I'll do that for most these beds so if you need any more information check the description now we're moving over to the Brooklyn bedding signature mattress which is actually the one that I'm sleeping on right now it's not the bed I'm on right now but it's the bed that's at my apartment so this is an eleven and a half inch thick mattress and incorporates different types of film it does have pocketed coils and a kind of nice thing about this is that they offer three different firmness levels you got the soft the medium and the firm so if you want to sleep specifically on your side you may check out their medium or their softer option if you're a back and stomach sleeper check out the medium or the firm option so you have a little bit of flexibility with Brooklyn I think this is an incredibly comfortable mattress and Brooklyn actually owns their own manufacturing facility so they make their own beds a lot of people don't they make their own beds and they ship them directly from their facility in Phoenix Arizona now we have dream cloud newer mattress brand out there but it does come with a lifetime warranty or they I think they call it their ever long warranty read the warranties on all these beds check those out usually it's nothing scary but you should read warranties before you purchase their thousand dollar minimum product and then they also have a 365 night trial so you have a year to test out the bed and if you really want to scam the system you could pretty much go bed company to bed company and not really ever end up spending any money I don't encourage that though do not do that and if you do do not tell them I told you to do that because it's unethical but dream cloud it's a 15 inch mattress super durable very thick really nice mattress it will soften over time because it's using memory foam a little bit of latex film as well and then as a cashmere cover some people will like the cover some people will hate the cover it has pronounced peaks and valleys for me it's distracting it's annoying and I don't love it deep pain the pain train no slept on this bed for quite a while in fact I had to pry it from his hands just to get some more footage of the bed anyways they cover it just has those peaks and valleys and I just think some people might not like it but apparently Dylan loves it it only does come in one firmness level it's like a kind of a medium firm I think it's really comfortable it's gonna be best though for back stomach and then combination sleepers kind of like myself that rotate positions at night also dream cloud is one of those companies that sets prices a little bit higher and almost always has a coupon code check the description also they're reviewed out there now we have a better known brand it is Lisa although I'm not taking their original mattress we're going with Lisa Sapiro which is their high-end bed it's their coil mattress and I happen to really really like this one it is an 11 and a half inch thick mattress it's about a medium to a medium firm gonna be best for back and stomach sleepers in particular you're gonna sleep a lot more on the bed as opposed to in it but it's gonna be durable supportive it does have quite a lot of bounce and has good edge support as well for couples so if you're sleeping on a smaller bed and you want to utilize the entire space of the bed you want to bed I said that a million times now you want a mattress that allows you to sleep along the perimeter because the space is so small so Lisa superior is really good for that to me it's the best mattress that they make now we're on to the bed that I'm on right now and I think this one probably more so than any bed out there that we've had people test is the one that elicits that uh oh my god this is comfortable feeling I think almost every single person has laid on his bed and said that mat slept on this mattress for like I half a year maybe more we do rotate bed so I don't fault us there but yeah he slept on this bed for a long time and he really really likes it very supportive very luxurious like it looks a cut above most online brands or online mattresses nest bedding just makes really good products and the hybrid one has a little bit of Bounce does come in different firmness levels we have the medium it's on the softer end though so it's gonna be better for like stomach sleepers and combo sleepers you will also appreciate though that nest bedding backs all their products with a lifetime warranty which is pretty rare and then also they have a lifetime comfort guarantee which again gives you even more downside protection of you don't end up liking and after their trial period you can get a discounted mattress they just want to make people happy look into their lifetime comfort guarantee it's pretty cool now we have the new purple mattresses so if you're a subscriber you know I happen to love purple beds if it wasn't for my girlfriend I would probably sleep on a purple mattress and it would probably be one of their new ones so they have purple - purple 3 in purple for the only difference really is that the thickness of the hyperelastic polymer changes so on purple to two inches purple 3 3 inches purple for 4 inches and purple forward yes it would be my favorite even though it is very very expensive so these beds are pretty dang durable like pretty freakin durable and they have coils on the bottom so they are gonna be better for heavier people like previously with the older purple bed it really wasn't great for heavier people these are gonna be a lot better for heavier people and if you don't know about purple look we've done a ton of videos we've done a lot of posts on them check in the description but here's the quick rundown purple uses a proprietary material it's kind of like gel maybe like silicone a little bit like rubber and it has very little surface area and allows for a ton of airflow so it's one of the best beds out there for staying cool it doesn't actively cool you down but it doesn't sleep warm and it will never warm up so these things are amazing purple for is almost like you're floating it's super cool now purple doesn't really ever offer any coupons they will do bundles so if you check the link in the description you can see what they're currently offering usually it's like a pillow or a sheet set or something like that now we have sava super luxurious brand they make three different beds their original soft the mattress is super nice the downside with them is that they don't have free returns it's like 99 bucks to return it but that being said comes in three different firmness levels has an organic cotton cover that smells amazing the bed is really comfortable incredibly supportive it does have two layers of coils so you have your inner spring system and then your pocketed coils and surprisingly it has relatively little motion transfer so if you want a luxurious bed you want the organic cotton cover and you want your choice of different firmness although satva is one of the best picks out there but like purple they don't offer any discounts almost ever I don't even know if they do bundles so their bed is already affordable enough that's what they're saying and speaking of affordable and also a big name-brand Simmons so you've definitely heard of them Simmons has their Beautyrest line and if you're watching your wallet and if you want a more affordable coil mattress their silver lineup is really nice they offer different firmness levels they are 14 inches thick and they're really nice mattresses it's just that they're very very affordable so if you're going into a store or you're buying for like us mattress comm and you're on a budget this is gonna be a really good pickup and you just want to make sure that you find the right one for your sleeper type they have a softer one that's just way too soft for me they're gonna have some firm ones that are probably gonna be too firm for you so try and figure out the one that fits you best and also sticking with Simmons kind of tomorrow's sleep so they offer two beds we're talking about the hybrid but this company even though it's called tomorrow sleep they're actually backed by syrtis simmons so just keep that in mind they offer a 365 night trial full year to try out their bed and it is a memory film and pocketed coil mattress so if you don't like memory film just move on you're not gonna like to spend that being said I think it's comfortable it's actually kind of like a medium for medium to medium soft medium firm memory foam a little bit of the stuck in the mud feeling but if you like memory foam it's pretty nice and because as the coil is really supportive and it makes it easier to switch positions when you're rotating around on the bed and you're kind of flipping around and stuff like that I like that tomorrow sleep bed it wouldn't be my personal favorite pic out there but there are people that love memory foam and if you like that and you want some coils on the bottom tomorrow sleep I think it's a very good bed and last up we have wink beds I've talked about them in other videos they make luxurious pens I mean I think on their website they even say that they're like luxurious hotel beds and that's what they would remind me of they're thick they're like 14 15 inches thick they use two different layers of coils super supportive they usually have a pillow top that's really comfortable they offer a soft a luxury firm a firm and then even a plus-sized for super heavy folks they're hand made in Wisconsin they're just really nice mattresses so if you're looking for a more of an innerspring bed with kind of a pillowtop cover this luxurious it's nice that's very supportive Wenck beds is definitely a winner that's it for the list it's a lot of talking for me but we also have the honorable mentions so let's get to that quickly all's well hybrid relatively new brand owned by Walmart avocado it's a natural and organic mattress really nice probably could have been on this list easily big fig specifically made for people with a bigger figure really nice mattress I don't sleep hybrid flippable bed relatively new company brentwood Oceano super nice bed reminds me of the one I'm sitting on now or the bear hybrid so that's it see you guys next time have a great day [Music]", "8NWEJ5sguac": "so what do you reckon Alyssa

really appreciate sir my cherries turns on strands parks do you know what's wrong a silver zombie gaming is is any ship that goes transparent when it's non the colored means it's traced somehow so you have to look at your water parameters things like I will check first is the heat as it is the tank being heated enough is it warm and then look at your board primers if you don't have if you're using tap water for example check your pH th first and go from there go for a walk with no thought she can read Lauren's she can read Augustine tongue hello welcome to the stream that's only cause you can't

by the way guys as well the other issue was me trying is streaming 60fps these cameras only go to theory of gear so it would be wasted in 60fps I'd have to upgrade this camera at least to 60fps which I will probably do have her swim with the shrimp kidding swim the shrimp Jack be nimble hello welcome to the stream those are cool come at pump 19 says he'll love Lissa pee did you hear someone is someone coming who's that is it funky gonna kill well maybe she's heard someone either and we can actually start she's she's like a guard dog at the door or maybe she's coming back again alright guys I think we'll head over to the tongue hello Kay welcome to the stream as well forgot to say just say your name D H a.m. zero zero hello welcome to the stream your shrimps are high or and streamed on a 65 inch TV W air how big is your TV 65 inch was done 65 inches for is that not like almost two and a half three meters in size bears your I'll be hello welcome to the stream hello I've painted finish shrimp and Guppies my a leotard I have big java moss and co2 system should I use it up oh my god I can't talk today yes I would I would use them a filter in your tongue for sure depends on how well you have it set up and tuned in because I've seen some co2 syrups that have lots of plants on they have like bazillions of oxygen bubbles when when the stuff pearls so it just depends on the setup the print montes bit your hand you have to be careful with pre- is because the the bites can affect your hands like a zombie Farzad hello sir hello right so shall we jump over to the other stinger magic brother tank see what cameras now let's let's do some stuff here you may also hear Lucy barking in the bark one when I'm doing stuff by the way guys I'll get rid of this little screen so you can see more stuff which I'll do just now actually if I can actually remember how to do this stuff shrimp comm that's the wrong one so buh-bye mark where's the where is this one that one can go as Weldon so you will only see this much oh cool the camera back a little bit but I have to keep the door open when it's sixty five and I should use it I have a flu valve 106 hollow iron external marks this support channel HTTP four slash four slash to sport DG horror slash hello Coco John says woof the TV is 1.65 meters that's pretty big over here let's say I want to see Lucy hello hello I'm Alex by the way bored angora Alice all right guys I'm gonna move over I think my headphones are long enough for me to do this as well right will position the camera reposition it and make take me a few goals to do this because oh I'll have to you know do it on the fly I'm just gonna quickly wash my arms again because I was holding Lucy so remember of what we said before when you wash your arms with washing up liquid try and use unscented stuff cuz you don't want that that scent or anything from the scent to go you have the tanks do you face to wash your arms like you're a surgeon you can hear me wash my arms here give your arms a good rinse um this might sound a little bit gray but I re actually have my own towels from a symptom they only use for shrimp rim stuff right so I only dry my arms with these towels as well I don't go and use something else in my wife's used with the conditioners and all that kind of stuff for eight years to get over here think I just need to close the door weave it let's pull you back how is that looking a little bit more my apologies have you hear me burping by the way that's almost good enough you know this camera here is probably the worst of the two for the exposure setting being pretty rubbish on it I don't know what it is it just doesn't cope with the lighting very well a little bit higher maybe I should have moved a laptop over here but then it'd have to move all the cables as well I've got almost there guys almost there right so that will do is then focus doesn't really need to be in focus that great here he's the biggest who what who said that can you weigh in the camera view all I see is green rock pile god damn it Leo get back to your ice fishing which I hopefully will be doing a lot of this year no the reason you're very limited to what you can see here guys is I have a door right behind the camera that needs to be open because Lucy is here in our own let me just pick a box good but let me see Jesus Christ mark bloody dddd right so I'm gonna clear up a wee bit you guys will be good and seen in the comments what more just do the top yeah I know guys I know Jesus maybe I should have pre-planned this a little bit okay so this is probably enough yes it will do it will do right so I have an 8 I'm gonna use a bucket we're gonna do some siphoning and it isla Hansen if you're in here I don't mean you right so I have to pass my headphones through this space here all right guys right so the way I do my water changes is like this but we will of course go over to we will of course go over to the war change back in a section will tell you are dead below because you guys will know already I use reverse osmosis water so I always be first guys is I take the water and then I Nick mostly the the duckweed from the top because layer will be able to go through the stuck weed and see if there's any baby shrimp right armed I think we're being lucky with this tank because I don't see a ton of babies in here the babies that we had before are like almost the adult size so they're quite easy to spot right so I use this this is a power what's it called a Power Bait container with the tea strainer half a tea strainer dremeled into the top here you guys have seen this before I like using this because the tea strainer the dumb or of the stainless steel the holes is tiny it's like 0.5 milk which is perfect for this kind of stuff right so and we go like this and then seitan and of course you won't be able to see that part but trust me you you'll see the water level wouldn't in here and I'm only going to take her but 4 or 5 liters from this tank 4 or 5 liters and that is it because I'm still thinking along the lines of 10% is good but I wonder if we can get away with a teeny bit less I know it's on the outside of the glass roots or lies it already give a get all that crap off and this is one of the ones I showed you guys before one of the tips when you have lots of baby shampoo so it's kind of awkward to try and get all the duckweed over so taking shrimp with a right and the easiest way to do is just actually to use your hand I use it like a rake like you would use in the garden like this okay so you get all your stuff into the corner might take some of this Portland stone as well all your stuff into the corner here let's you see how my fingers are separated bring all to the corner it gives any shrimp that's in there chance to escape hopefully we don't have any duckweed and not duckweed a string like you would do a little bit not too much about touch because I can get pain to remove right and then you go we've actually removed probably a good 60% of all that duck weed that was across the top already in one handful and then what I do guys is I go over to a barbecue skier I'll show you down a second simple barbecue skewer I like to use the wooden ones because they're kind of course on this side it helps to grip the string Algy it's all you do this is put it in like this I start to twist you see there depending on the type of string all you have it will be harder and harder for you to turn right when you're doing this guy's just make sure that there's no baby shrimp in it so you have to be quite vigilant here and try and shake off any snails that's what I always do like this just give it a shake and when there's this much it tends to be a little bit too much later so break off you should green lollies here use your fingers and just pull it right off like that I'd see gone on to the next better and as I said while you're doing this make sure you're checking for baby shrimp and snails you see there's like a malaysian trumpets neighborhood you give this a shake enough it will come off hopefully if it doesn't come off they will go into they were going to the bucket anyway right where you will have you would give a second chance whatever snails are whatever going here they all got a second chance because you will be rechecked this pocket anyway all right so I'm not too bothered if I lose a few bits of stone I just break the algae off and throw this lump of the bark I don't want all this stone at the time that's already a huge improvement we've only just started race I want to get some of the stuff up for the bird then can hear Lucia barking there somewhere this is actually stuff that stuck to the back of the glass like so come on let's get more of the same we already have a lot oh you just have to keep on going and going and going and going so this isn't too hard to do and it's only gotten this far because a pure laziness I've actually swapped there lakes around on this tank as well with with one of the other ladies just to see if I can get difference in algae growth in the shallow AC tank because it isn't enough I don't think for them it's not the right type of algae they need like a lot of biofilm and it's just not growing in that time very well there's silly let's see we can get these last bits off here maybe some of the longest best off for this sponge in that ideal world or just cleaning that sponge pillar but see I'm still off like this while I'm doing I'm making sure that I'm not grabbing shrimp snails anyway so that's already a big improvement this just depends on how from Nikita you want to be you can spend an hour on this and go really fantastic looking by the way this little something here look at them on the cool so get this stuff up here and then we'll put the water back in and then we'll do a feeding on this tag now however should this a little bit different well explain that to you in a second once we put in the time so the big clump of all give the bark you listening to get some of this a week just like a lollipop Malaysian trumpet snails on them as well is here give a shake it all falls off that's already bazillion percent better than it was so there's just a few bits here I'm not happy with I'm gonna do by hand although it's pretty much yeah I think maybe a little bit more in the back here see if we can get some of this long stuff off the bar there you go that's not so bad all right so that is most of the stuff out that we need to take care of the tag it's gonna quickly dry the edges and then we're gonna put a Warren now quickly go over here and I'll switch on the other camera so you guys can see what I'm going to talk a bit with the water and how we add that back to this time one second [Applause] okay let me just fix the caramel go back to the main screen for a minute please subscribe if you haven't already rip your phone users hello Belle notification alright so here's the war container here I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you the war container and I'll explain what we're doing with it at the same time so here is my war container this is for all my reverse osmosis water goes into you guys are probably the regulars in the stream we'll have seen a 600 times before let me get this off there for you chat box right so I have circulation pumps in here my reverse osmosis water comes in through here in the top if you don't use reverse osmosis war on you use a top like this then you must use at the corner right but all water goes in here sits in here for 24 hours I then add my salts which is oh this this is what I use for my neo Cardenas on my tiger shrimp and this this cost about 30 40 euros for this size of top I think it's this one's like a kilo I'm not sure if if they make this size anymore or if they make this smaller sizes I have noticed in Europe a lot of the ones are sold Avon this so get it well you can kinda thing so I add as I said this is like 25 litres of war I add this amount six point five grams to get 182 parts per million TDs and that's why I use for neo caridina because this is what they recommend the people that make the buffer whether simple conversion you can do in the bar from microsiemens of Benyus here ben and jerry they know all about microsiemens you divided something by something like 1.56 the microsiemens and it gives you the tds okay so this stuff is all ready to go i drop something in there what was there what did I drop in there it sounded like mail let me see it was a spoon thank God that's all it was alright so that war is actually ready to go into the other tank well let me show you one more thing as well I have an extra pump up here we have two pumps in here the gray one is a circulation pump this one here is a pump that pumps up to a higher head if you don't know what that means and it means this when you have a water container right the the power of the pump on it will see the head height and the hair tay is important because you need to know how far the pumpkin side here how high you can pump up street vertically and that is important in a shrimp ring ray because if you have an underpowered pump like my gray one is in here it means I can stop tank up here if I use the gray one it simply wouldn't be strong enough to pump the war up there right so that is why I have a bigger pump in there that has a high pay tight pump rewrite this one is like three meters or something which is more than enough for my shrimp rim alright so then we pump that war from that Cantina via a pipe very simple plate so even on it is let me see can you see if it took me spilling all over the place you can see there I have that blue a container and a blue container the blue pump is on your own I don't use a tarp or anything like that I actually just use my finger like this close it okay so in here is my reverse osmosis war with my buffer already made and all I have to do is put this clamp on the tank could I do this with one hand my left hand to change camera angles put this on whom seal by God why they make it so difficult see please don't break off let me so embarrassing and there you go you guys can barely see that because of the Blue Dream thing is in the way but trust me on the right hand side you can maybe just make it oh actually that there's water going into that tank on the top not much point misciagna unless you I can actually see what I'm talking about you can kinda see let's so that was the border wrong thing to grab mark it's thinking good idea so you can see up the top here on the right hand side right so we'll keep that on there until it is done because too many times skies I've like not paid attention and let tanks overflow so today we won't do that we'll we'll just wait until this one's filled and then I'll deal with this then we can feed the tongue okay okay port football understand er as your pawns hello welcome to the stream I measure Ponce's how many shrimp you need to get babies technically you only need a male and a female but you bear with more shop and breeding tinder that is like the comment that means that you're getting it you're part of the shrimp farm he says haha I'm starting to understand this hobby now what do you do with the extra shrimp get extra tanks is the correct answer the go that wasn't so hard right so this is filling up you can see the flaw right there this will be at least a few liters a minute probably what was that oh I'm back I'm back in the room computer says no I said well let this fill up I have a different food for this today that'll tell you guys about what when we're feeding and it is it's not something that you typically think of DeFede shrimp but I was looking at the ingredients today and I've tried in a few my tanks and just let's see guys right just let's see just let's see this I put the food in my tanks and you even see that from this angle I can't get the camera in the closer god damn it you can probably just make that over all the shrimp this is the tacos having deaths and remember last week this is all the shrimp boom absolutely crazy for this good bye guys and I put this food in here like four hours ago and they're still doing absolutely bananas for it I put a little bit in this tank error on this tackle my house like five something here where did where did you take it so that this one also had a bit in it today and it's completely gone so did this one and you can tell they've totally inna guys because look how far spread out there right so I'll do a big reveal of that food in a second I've actually fed all my tanks that same food today race so it's something I'm gonna start to use regularly and it's not meant for shrimp either but I can't see why it wouldn't be meant for shrimp it's a secret food secret food for massive shrimp success and by the way guys I actually think it's gonna be an awesome food for shrimp too so bottoms up and so let me see do I even have the pocket here for this food let me quickly no I can't I can't leave the room because the cameras in the way oh my god I haven't thought this over very well oh I do I have a bigger piece up there like a piece of the food let me just get it and then we'll what a full screen because that tank is almost cool you see it it's almost full and then we can do the reveal of the secret food days this shrimp love it shrimp absolutely love it just keeping an eye on that war level there dried mushroom you know I will give someone in the comment section a packet of nettle mix right now if one of you guys can tell me what the food is there's a green bean Lord that we can tell me what the food is specifically like if you just run them the guess what it is then I'll send you food nope it's not green beans it's no broccoli Bryan my people says it's crystal blocks no it's not crystal block but our dog use them it's good avocado no I wouldn't go anywhere near my thanks Nell makes no it's almost a good answer but not quite beans on toast then spinach is something I've never tried actually dried apple tree leads nope crushed celery lettuce maple leaves no bio mix nope this will surprise you I think this is gonna surprise the loggia cucumber no bugs no SOS I dunno what is hello Lawrence by the way I think I missed your name Leafs melon no pumpkin no broccoli it's bacon I tell you what that tank is overflowed oh Jesus once a good so just shows you there how horrific my memory is we're actually watching the tank and I don't see that it's almost overflowing almost it's about a centimeter from the top connec pagane pagana banana no turmeric powder no frozen at media note zucchini zucchini nope grass wheat grass powder no dog meat for shrimps oh you're very close very close I knew flooding avoided sent tea or salad you were praying there's like haha doesn't see the tanks gonna explode the glass will just shout everywhere brewers yeast nope I think I'm gonna move the camera over and then we'll put the food in one of you were almost correct one of us was almost correct dog food nope beer beer beer in let's get us come over I'm not sure how I'm gonna do this because how can I see this screen from away over there ginger beer dog food technically no Oh 67 people watching shrimp food dried blood work I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it guys so don't have to give you wanna a pocket he's a squash 16g pass who said that they said who said down the pinna Charlie I am NOT a squash stingy bar alright let's get you down here to the substrate area roughly down here I'll set you up somewhere lovely we may actually tick you off this let's see I'm not sure how well this is going to focus but at least we can get you off the tripod I don't want that black line there now obviously have to fix the focus for the mourners I saw ideal they have worn that back edge there you see the edge where the yeah that's a good edge it's almost in focus first time not even Scott see the Hargis I love haggis is my absolute favorite food Hargis mashed potatoes neeps oh just think the beer a nurse I would kill a puppy just to have her go straight now Lucy better not see though what I think to see be far faster smart get set of focus Alice you're out of focus haggis neeps delicious that's what it is it's actually hardness no it's not I saw that the camera needs to go down at Todd rate and I'll put the food down right and then we'll see if anyone can guess from then on but but the game is finished finito I have to use the I have to use this pipe because my earrings not so great I mean like for food not for anything else pair boots or this is a lovely bit food here one of you were almost correct by the way hopefully this food will go all the way down please where are you there you go now what I'll do guys race I'll come over here and I'll check the chair and I'll see cut off stop it cut it off come as a wee bit high come as a taught high that will do you think but in the focus mode Paul Tina doing know what that is sniper trooper says dog that's exactly what it wouldn't know it wasn't tier solid correct it's kind of dog treat but I am in Norway too seldom for us cop stick things and it smells like right so I've been breaking up Lopez so this today and giving it to the shrimp and they have been going absolutely crazy for it and it's 40% protein right and I think I think it's something like twenty or thirty twenty or thirty percent locks which is summoned I was thinking what would not make an awesome shrimp thing that shrimp leaks to block doesn't it's to block looks like a piece of hot dog sniper wipers right no this is actually cartridge you said dog food as I tried to give you a clue you said or you came to write but no one said carpet no not a single one mark I mentioned G and my recent shrimp update video here will don't know send me a link mark at mark Peggy mark pay get a hot meal calm send me a link to you actually I'll just go in your channel put a channel spam spam channel I obviously can't watch it right now the video though I'll subscribe to you know watch it Lea Donald thank you for that let's deal with this camera a little bit I don't know why it's so blurry you know that it's the good old shrimp calm you know the it's never like perfect looks like a piece of hot dog and the hot dogs do you eat chicken lips oh my god chicken lips okay so this looks underexposed there's my guys the picture so let's fix it boom there it almost twice that is so bright the white is super bright in the shrimp or dark you see this there's a shrimp and there they should should be removed now I'm not impressed with this Karma for this type of stuff here because these are meant to be like blue dreams and stuff but look how look how to and they focus to come resin like the ages and stuff I just I get sick of this camera chicken lips looks like a piece of hot dog so I was right lux yes it was luxe as their copper maybe there could be layer Fadi asked did you know this guy's right the shrimps blood is made with copper you know how it like human bodies human blood is iron based called hemoglobin well shrimp blood is copper based I can't remember the first it word for it guys and you guys know Leah J you might know what's the word for copper based blood as it my mice Cardmember mycelium mycelium copper yeah so I'm not sure what it's really up with this camera boys like as the the to Commerce a is the worst don't we have your dogs confit of X the what that's just rubbish that's one of those things that people say an internet without really knowing what they're talking about don't give my dog carpet there are facts there I say missus diet is very varied she gets minced beef minced pork mince chicken mince not mince locked where she gets lock swishes salmon quite regularly her hair dye is quite varied so I wouldn't worry about like us given her treats meant for cars so what is up here to fight balance what's up I'm dying guys to show you there will see their ass amazing that at the Lord that white balance and the shrimp look blue again so what's the blurriness and never win yes mark google it no I don't need to google it I only feed Lucy the odd car treat the lot sausages some some things I just eat cat food for lunch I can't see so here in cat food makes those dogs go Blaine esta lies I would just what I would just know how to post out here you what there will be no posting jibber jabber on this channel yes so I've been told apart from the ones that are like the odd columnist Hank the there's blue velvet and blue dreams and the one that is like the biggest female isn't that a blue diamond too many kim yuna variations on the name it's the shrimp litter blue they're a nightmare to film although the picture shouldn't be this blurry though looks like it's focusing on the bond I can't even see the screen my eyes are so scripted oh you know what it could be guys my body you know what is I think he said and fully in gym I could be what is every stream it's an issue with these effing cameras why can it not be like a I where they just do do what they're meant to do let's see it's not in zoom is it it was it was kind and zoom to for us but it's so blurry but now now I need to fix the focus sir the shrimp are just so dark you know like the the base the substrate where you can see all the like half shells and stuff they're white and kind of focus a little bit Sniper Versailles cotton dog food are more or less the same yeah I think so like if you go to like the factories where they make this kind of stuff a lot of it will be made the same 70 viewers hello shrimp farm welcome if you're new to the channel let me quickly go over what myself you said that you said plug myself if you knew your channel then please hit the subscribe button and Pell notifications so you never miss another yes Lea mode is the Lea is the new moderator by the way on Facebook of any you want to congratulate her on her promotion what the hell happened to the ship come I'm getting absolutely sick with this camera we did nothing there and look how they're almost like block Sakura no but you notice like the shell is almost normal color did I not put the light back across maybe I haven't got enough light on the tongue the light is above the tank they look almost black God these cameras are pain in the butt I hope Torian is considered an essential amino my sister's car therefore all cars required dogs in the other hand can make their own children which is why my daughters are deficient and missing you want me hey Mikey notice three of my Amano shrimp have been colleagues for at least here for weeks now is that normal yes probably but you should be aware of the Amano shrimp the young wouldn't survive in freshwater unfortunately but I won't tell look at this tank but I'm sick of this camera you know though I'm just trying to see if we should press one of you think we should shift to the silhouette attack because I tell me something guys the a lot is the Scylla we have been out in numbers today press one of you want to see the silhouette press 2 if you think I should try and fix this camera again on here it's gonna be the same camera but I think you might be a lighting issue Torian pop 19 noses noisy steroids right there pop 19 - did do I need an almond leaf and my cherry time do you need no you don't need to have them but they are beneficial and shrimp tanks I have lots of them and all my tanks I have like even hole branches with like six leaves on them one one or you want me to try and fix it okay you want me to try and fix it there's always these awkward people in nature okay so what do you guys reckon it is why is it boys the issue with blue shrimp that is so hard for the camera to pick up need a spotlight for these you think because there actually is quite hard from in the tank itself is lit well enough but on here they just look ridiculously the wrong color contrast saturation that's not it is exposure isn't it guys but how do I lift the exposure and not wash it the fights hair please I think mark sales them I do I do sell them but I think right now I only have like five or six pockets left oh let me see now white balance maybe let's play with this that did absolutely nothing bring this movie but when I find the answer to filming blues but that is this kinda works this is kind of working a little bit this years that you have fed your camera carpet I can't you know I actually can't even see the screen that world today I need to have a I need to wait a car play this white bounce back like compensation let's see if this does anything no that's made it worse saturation is just a color isn't it blue this is probably probably about as good as going to get unless I put the brightness rate up probably but as good as it's gonna get with these guys I just lost one of my best female chilli she gave birth to eggs and two days later she was dead oh yeah that is often the way it happens as well with females they're waiting waiting waiting so long it must be quite stressful for them not to mow when they need to and the waiting told have had the babies and some of them at the end up being just too weak and they died firstly if you want to see me do something crazy what you want me oh it could that possibly be Blizz longer length weave and blurry Chaz human eye yeah I don't know what it is rate when I look at the tongue it looks fine to me but then on the cameras that you just can't see it carpet will make a dog farm possibly kidney issues this is long term and the occasional tree which is what we are talking about yes oh I'd give Lissy these treats ever deal with us maybe dictum three three three hey wait a minute what tank is that for three holy what tier salad thank you for the months of Ganesha [Music] it's very appreciated thank you sir fear solid 500 Danish trances it's like I don't know where is it it must be like 600 Norwegian krone or something like that thank you very much for that by the way it's really appreciated if mrs. Dennis Bogart another Dennis if me Mamma Mia Magnus who plans going cray cray hello and good evening everyone hope you're feeling better I'm action Thanks I am Nadya I actually have to go to hospital tomorrow but I have to go a hospital tomorrow but I I actually don't know why they didn't they weren't very specific in the lair what's the name of the car treats let me one second guys I'll gonna get the pocket for you thank you thank you oh Jesus rip headphone users again my bad guys right so the name of the stuff I use is or the stuff I'm gonna use because I reckon this would be a really good food for the shrimp is this is they're just called whiskers sticks right and these sticks are I'll actually tell you what whereas it says 90% fish it says white fish and lox which is summon my god my Norwegian is so bad maybe I should have glasses on for this oh my god what's this German I'm reading German here anyone read German last fraction zero no I don't have a high Spector she on a stick for cars honestly that is what it smells like but am lucy-belle loves them as well you know I'm not so sure wouldn't see it says it's farmed responsibly I don't know what that means if you give me a second I'll be able to tell you exactly what it is analysis 40% protein as we talked a bit before rasca mineral I don't know what eyes 21% Boston 29% like that I must be doing it wrong because barn is water yeah can't read it Brian Khan Frank and reach airman well you know what I got Brian I bought a whole load of eggs German military gear that would be what was it called is it flock Tim flocked here in Carmel maybe plucked in camo so what I saw is your English flock down camo I got a nice waterproof gore-tex jacket I also bought the British Army I can't remember what's called a MTP smoke as well to go with it and I got the gore-tex flocked air hoses and they've got a bar shot today as well and you guys have been in the Army were probably like oh my god is buying all this army gear I'm in the army no no it's a little pinkish antibiotic Lyn farmed salmon ciske how did that's not entirely true okay I've actually spoken to some people to work in the industry and it is in some foods but not all foods don't know fish vibes see you tomorrow or the next day whenever I stream next it will be a sorry Peter Rock one three one three welcome to the shrimp farm thank you for subscribing by the appear you probably already know this but you see it's not the shrimp inform on the wrong bloody screen when you subscribe remember and hit the bell location have you hit the bell notification then it remains you there stream oh by the way guys I want to talk about something just very very ever so briefly right because when you do the kind of stuff that I do you always get haters always I have had like four or five different people like that are very vindictive and hateful you know like they're just mean because I don't know this a jealousy thing or portray and there's a guy recently there's been making like a ray just posts about Mira even posted in my own a sham keeping group right and it's a guy that used to be here all the time that I used to talk to all the time and I I can't understand what's happened to him overnight like that he just he just he just flipped right and if you are in the char right I understand sometimes like alcohol especially can make people see and do things but but things right but I've known I've actually known this guy for well over a year and he just just all of a sudden like this flipped and it's very sad ray and I hope if you're watching that you go and get help right before it kills you because it will is that what the militaries for no I have the greatest respect for old military personal personnel I can join you in your foxhole no it wasn't trolling right it's a I honestly think the guy has an alcohol problem he's an alcoholic and he's fine when he's not drinking and I think he liked when he's I mean I've helped him with so much stuff but it's shrimp and then just instantly overnight to change to this vindictive hateful trawler like you know you wonder how can someone change like just like that in this alcohol it's always when people change like that it's always alcohol normally just notice the beer market or you can see it more here Konya yeah this was a test with the like party died but I was like no no we're not Nadiya that might be very true maybe he is unwell cuz I'm not the person that holds a grudge I can understand that the guy is sick right by he needs to go and get help aquarium and duckweed is amazing by the way I have killed with a duck weed in this freezer that I'm gonna like liquid eyes and add to my food I keep on forgetting to add it but we brine is already here but I'm my bad Brian I didn't know you were here I wouldn't talk about you behind your bar I'm not always nice to here's though Dennis I've had some really awkward encounters with here sometimes on on YouTube some of them are even youtubers guys again overnight change instantly it's amazing how many you get and it says I have orange facial hair but Brown here me too I actually have like ginger in my hair the sides on green I think it's still a yes I hope I'm actually hoping that it's watching this right and it's just if he's watching it just to let him know that I don't hold against them and I hope he goes and gets help seeing I turn on the volcano watch it and sit back and watch the fish swim I hate smell when you liquidized ugly I by the way why does duckweed go like your pinky purple color after it's been out of the water for a little while what as though I've noticed dated some of the bugs it was you know if you don't store it fast enough cookies and milk solve the world's problems yes like my mother every time she drunk I would highly every day oh that's that's sad to hear my pizza ginger and squash as a tater salad is said to be ginger and I think I [Music] already have the die for it already so I'm just waiting I don't know I was gonna do on Halloween but when is Halloween is it tomorrow it will be probably on Sardis Stream and my beard will have changed color there's there's another reason as well may I have the hospital tomorrow on them I don't know why I have to go there they are but they weren't really specific in the lair that they send me it doesn't mention about anything about me going in for my operation or anything like that yet so it's probably just another meeting with the surgeon again because even though I've already been long lifted gingers you know I was told when I was younger the ginger-haired people have no soul I'm holding my laughing so hard they're ginger people have no soul and every freckle they have is a soul they've taken by the way what happened to those they're lovely shrimp let's see how they're doing what is going on sort of my part of it this is the second time we've tried to do this tankard it's just so hard to film these guys and what we're going to do though is we have about 20 minutes left because I want to finish the stream a bit hard pass today I have another something else I have to do I want to raise the camera up and I want to show you the silhouette because guys they're so beautiful they're so so beautiful I have a ton of freckles says Eddie Eddie my bad seller look into my eyes seller oh you guys are sorted by any chance we know mark long live the gingers we have souls look alright guys so I'm am hammock again gonna do this stream starting I don't want to pee or not stream windscreen subscribe again if you haven't already I need to take that off autoplay because I must get annoying for you guys to watch all the time it's me to six years sober let's start there I have a blemish I have a blemish I probably can't do this with the headphones on so I'll just keep on talking to you guys fella do this and you have to look at this scenery behind here they just think of questions is this work still have this I still have the headphones on so let me extend tripod legs before I do anything else oh yeah so my buck is actually quite bad today I was you know what it was doing that war change I bought Kingdom said to me look mark if you're gonna put us under this much abuse sure honey we're going to punish it was like no please bark please it's like okay we'll give you a second chance but come on don't do again like fine pain please oh so just be a second guys you trying to adjust camera thingamajiggy you know with my we squash just went legs and stuff I have severe polio walk like I've been riding a horse Oh Molly why is it is so awkward today everything I'm doing tryna just legs units like one step forward 20 steps backwards for this thing all right let me see I'm gonna let the common up I shouldn't be too much longer I'll be back guys don't worry don't worry no more tears tears oh yes this is me barely the triple so see all right I have to come up to size but I think it's too big for this corner and when I'm gonna move the camera into this side guys are watching a blog screen fill my shoes and the typo just wants to fall over come on check what's the story here all right let's see if that works there if this works here we'll put the fridge right there and again we're gonna try it with a little bit of this treat I'll put you guys on the caramel a we have five years left yo left so this this cameras so much better than the other one although guys I took probably all but like two or three of the penis viruses are left in this time rate so it's nearly all silhoue see so don't be surprised if these guys don't like rush all to the food all the ones because they never do normally they never do but today they have been in numbers today they've been here in numbers so it will be nice if the play ball will come to the front for some food hopefully the sinks come on it's never a good sign when you put it in and it just nothing happens what the over here would it go on no oh there's the go little way into the rocks oh you know what it was is the foot it's the force of the of the war this is not going well guys I'm trying to hold it don't you there god damn it let's put you there then no oh my god visit gone don't laugh sound a bit no laughing in the comment section okay so we're just going to move the camera instead of trying to move the food everything's gone wrong no the camera is the wrong size oh my god I don't know how this even looks if this moves again I'm going to go crazy we might not even see anything here because it's so late this fit it probably will only take one shrimp to come over here and it will be gone Missy shrimp calm 71 people watching a blurry image Oh Shemp cameras who would have thought saying option camera would be so awkward lots of laughing lot of people saying Lowell in real life who says that press what have you runner in good long long long long long so what's up with this picture apart from there being a bazillion shrimp on it what's up with this picture the brightness maybe focus for one she does a decent image but the to the brightness is quite high so that means the exposure is too low yes that's just ruin the shot no you better not score we oh my god I can't win how am i doing it's getting worse that's a bit as good as it's going to get this really underexposed I don't think these cameras were made for this kind of thing I'm see will will see a shrimp eventually remember it's because the brightness is too high let's try that again add the brightness all the way up that's probably why something was wrong that's a bit as good as it's gonna get I think nor we mark these guys screaming the comments no mark we want perfect picture the squash yeah job Rick it's not gone well is it yep we have a food I'm looking at the bigger picture here and I can't see a shrimp at all lowering the frame rate it's only our 30 FPS of course the first one that come as a we cherry Brian screaming market these are not blue dreams mark Brian shut up I something just gonna close the shrimp own info instead of updating I can see one lurking yeah there are deer but they're just a mate teak I never for them to come across I didn't take into consideration that there was a flaw in this tank and it will push the food away from them are you talking about Brian blue dreams uh I don't see blue dreams on the screen whiskers stick treats yes come on shrimp come across their legs so far away from it what am I meant to do here they may never come to the front you know I need to do I need to see if this whiskers thing right we need to put some food in that they're actually going to go forth for the camera and we need to move the camera so you can see this the effing shrimp where's where's whisper Nordic to help me with this stuff [Music] if you're not a cafeteria right so I have some fit here that will sink for sure but by the time the stream is finished though there may be one one shrimp coming across today maybe one ever lucky yeah you should play the troll old song in the background right now or this time with me on the left-hand side of the food here guys there's a lot of Scylla we see so we just have to be all over patient watch the snow though they will go to the other food so have a tank for looking at the food looks lovely didn't it you can actually see the biofilm in the glass here with this I see white mittens though you can actually see the biofilm is the focus in the wrong thing yeah they're common there behind my picture on the left hand side you see them the willow white hands these commas for sure are not meant for this kind of stuff Dean Bank says it hasn't seen any shrimp bar boy you have to be so mean bro but this disdain banca is like so brutal come on get in there let's see some shrimp action some shrimp on shrimp action so this is a little bit dull this picture but we will be able to see the shrimp maybe of the turn-up where are you guys hello hello damn it the time they get Hugo's at stream is going to be finished whose jewel are you talking about only jewels discord hello Cheryl by the way waterproof camera last fraction zero no this is Logitech c920 it's actually a web camera there I swear to god guys they're literally right there behind my picture why isn't it coming forward instruction zero says they only want to nominal microorganisms and Brooks yeah I actually feed the misfit as well they're always a little bit slower though so we may not have enough time for this today we may have to I don't want to pay any more food in the time because well we're already pure couple pieces in come on shrimp where are you [Music] where are you you know I could do one last walk you oh my god the Commerce Oh dammit what a farce 72 people watching hello shrimp mom welcome to the stream old and you people haven't seen here before hello Smiley's Aquatics how you doing are they still away see well that's the be able that I have any in this time for no I have I have a lot them in this tank I spend more time in a stream fixing focuses and all that crap than actually looking at this shrimp everything every single stream the same because these cameras are so substandard sick of it sick of it it's like why is that why the blurry why are they even blurry separation they're not that real in this tunt is easily like 40-something silhoue see and here I started with 20 like a few months ago bum I'm absolutely disgusted by I hope who the camera quali is you know because this should really be at MEAP clear crisp frame and it's just rubbish did it I did it did it did it I mean I'm Blake literally blind guy Jay almost with my eyes and my vision is like ten times better than what you're seeing from there easily second second crop the images that's about as good as it's gonna get but there's no idle shrimp there yeah some of them might turn up like the what's disgusting is like look at the rock there on the right hand side why is that so out of focus remember remember to like the stream thank you now you can see some of them you can see like more and more of the little Hans going crazy I kind of wait to like maybe try and change and use a different camera from this like a DSLR but micro damage you're gonna yeah we have frost here as well we've had the cold quite quite a lot this week it's not cold called by a Norwegian standards it's only like minus four or five or something and mate I'm Cheryl Evans these are invisible ship no these are these are sila we see Cardinal silhouettes is shrimp highly unprofessional but Hylian thirteen no he said yeah entertain not highly entertaining my body color saturation is too high I need some I need someone technical help me with this stuff my problem is Gary is the is like the logitech cameras they never remember your settings saturation to I said is that do that that helps I helped a bit actually that help thank you for whoever mentioned out there that's a bit they advise I'm just so annoyed by how rubbish the focus is when you look at this image the image in the middle rate is barely in focus and the rest of the outside image is just crap it's absolutely rubbish nice to be baby here see it wouldn't be cool if it wasn't focused though but this 1080p camera yeah this is our web camera I can't really change stuff dear solid Holy Mother of God buying you camera a new counter for this kind of set will cost a couple of hundred dollars easily to improve on this kind of stuff bit thank you very much for that donation it's really really appreciate you're going to spend all your money you don't have to spend anything thank you though it's really appreciated it would be nice if we got a Lucy dancing Lucy though so no dancing Lucy on this screen sugar daddy here solids my sugar daddy apartment thank you theater salt again the focal point is on the food everything else and for grinev that will be blurry yeah but I want I want the whole image to be in focus just because it kind of ruins that when you're looking at my cream and the rest of their claim is is blurry so I don't know what that is is the aperture or something I need change your eyes so this is a web camera there's no settings like this in a web camera dennis boren guard says a need twice every twice it's really appreciate I actually do have the wife has a DSLR camera the wife has one that she doesn't use an awful sold that as a possibility because she even has micro lenses and stuff for it too but I think I have to buy a dongle or something for it what was it called an elgato USB dongle that you plug into the camera I'm not sure how it even powers or anything like that so I tear a solid need a pool boy no pool required what do you mean no pool boy refer all Dennis's are from Dennis from Denmark and then Dennis Mark kind of change the aperture on the common no all I have is the very basic settings like exposure all that kind of stuff so these cameras are really meant for like to look at us or faces because this camera you're seeing here this image is the same camera so you can see how it works okay with this no pool required says Brian what does it mean it was a cunningly to download a program then it could work a son Nick on something as she has hello RG have you doing sir smash the Karmann Ghia bear what I need to think of something anyway I'm I'm absolutely see this the c920 is fine for here for this image for aquariums is just rubbish need something new we may try a GoPro although I can't focus with a GoPro that's another issue alright guys we've gone past a time a little bit only a little bit though maybe maybe we can go for another five minutes I have something planned radar after Gordon watch I don't want to thank you guys I'm leaving to go and do something else but you know where's like I have other things that say to streaming as well really is in this corner oh she cover really is okay cool come on Cilla we see more force where are they it could also be just because like that this camera is really not mainly it's really really not meant for it's not meant for this king of stuff you know it's not meant for cream [Music] another aka gone on supercharged ten parents thank you very much Nadia she says not rich but towards the camera very generous tear salad thank you for me to Louisville for a good cause thank you very much another Thank You net here okay so it's not just that as well my whole camera setup is kind of like a sheet up today you can see let me look at that little shrimp on the left and we can't even see the thing shall we try and see you guys I want to see it before we go we must see this baby you must see it in perfect focus there's like mark four four see my bad guys hope none of you're offended mark for say we cut do this with your streams all the time half of your blame from the amount of stuff I've done here Jim come let's go shrimp come the final edit final eat it this is gonna be awesome configure video I said please mark plea I want to see it please if there is a God let us just let us focus on the baby oh you're so close almost there it's almost there the other issue is of course the camera is looking through the glass our Mongol but look at the little white arms there was perfect and then you ruin the show again because alone it's actually in time with the music it's a we DG thing who over doesn't go over there please don't go into the it's listening don't go over there little fella little fella please no hope it comes back down into that little bit oh yes it wants to be it wants to be a DJ I think tip i magnifier to that may be an option actually now look at look at this Neil coming in on the bomb okay look how bad the call is it's like my cameras of went backwards like there was it was the opposite weird evolving nice rooks me thank you very much here salads us a lot coming from you nice you know the other thing we could try is maybe the default settings for the camera but it will make the camera look awful what did what I just happened mark what did you do what did i do guys yeah I think I think we're done for the day I think we're done for the day yeah mark taught us how to throw a good karma party anyone what maybe I should start a stream for the camera guys that they come to come see marks or some karma party streams you've really knows what it's doing right so this is what this camera looks like when you sit on default and it's not stretched well that is small there's a wee camera so don't know I think this might be 720p something like that let me just check actually because it should tell me what the quality is no isn't actually what device default done no that was me I just made myself tiny oh my god I'm absolutely wrecking this stream today you ever have one of those days guys how is my ratios here by the way has it acceptable marks tech stuff before you go mark what type of camera as it is a Logitech c920 I have no idea what I'm doing I'm making a mess of all the cameras the oh I'm back I'm bigger again yeah good and so I wanted to at least have a we go I have like five minutes or something before I need to go and do what I have to do Jim calm okay so it's on the default settings configure video with it it's very very limited I have brightness contrast all that crap white balance what it looks like the is overexposed again will it be awesome have actually just did everything itself point is the camera out this the item on it just wasn't focused and stuff I think this is as good as it's going to get for today so the next stream will be on sadly we'll have fun Halloween themed thingamajig for it as well probably have pink beard by then to the pink beard donations are at the top of any you guys want to try and be a I think the the new donations have to start from after the next this month race so if you want to beat it I don't know what the donation will be but you guys will see so we mark that we more for mark please low yes marks low marks low everything will go wrong and shrimpin rim will happen I'm surprised the tank hasn't broken in front you as their brackish water no it could be but it's not it's fresh water fresh water high pH very low focus oh my god wait you know instead of this like moving the cameras around during the stream I'm gonna have to like fix them so the cameras are say looking at the things before we start streaming I think such a hassle this stuff well you need a channel you haven't subscribe you then please do remember and hit the bell notification so you never miss another video okay guys I'm gonna go and I'm gonna tell you what I'm going to go and do cuz I don't want you to crying and you and your big pillows with your massive heads I'm gonna watch the football I'm oh wait you're watch the football race so you guys have an awesome evening and let's select the patrons take it away bye guys I'll catch you in the next one happy shrimp game guys", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "lzIK9Io3RYg": "what's up guys back to my channel I really posted for reasons the reason I don't post is because I have an agenda to print out yeah I Joy's I can't say

welcome to royal fish aquatic well i know you read the title and you're wondering about these fish that i'm talking about these royal blue jaguar cichlids well what it is is a buddy of mine ended up breeding a jack dempsey and a jaguar regular jack dempsey not the electric blue ones just a regular jack dempsey and a regular jaguar and this is from the second time that he bred them and actually got six babies of them and i'm gonna start working on them now he's just did it once he did a few times getting out of them but i'm gonna continue the project so i got six of these bad boys i'm hoping i could grow them out all and get one to two pairs if i get two pairs i will be super excited i'm trying to get at least one pair so jack dempsey and jaguar hybrids this is how they kind of look they're very stressed out there's actually six babies in this bag and what i'm gonna do i'm gonna get the tank set up i'm gonna get these guys nice and acclimated but there's some work i want to do to the tank so i'm going to get the tank really really set up um really nice give them enough coverage because think about it jack dempsey aggressive fish jaguar aggressive fish mix them together aggressive fish so i'm gonna give them as much cover for they won't actually kill each other and i need to keep them fed constantly to lower down the aggression and have them nice and happy so let's get to that i'm going to start working on the tank for you guys get to see it and i would like to have give you guys a look when they're nice and relaxed in the tank so you could really see the beauty in this fish so let's get going so guys this is their tank i gave them a little bit of hiding spaces they kind of been chilling more about the sponge filter right now but let's give them some time and they will be having their territory and i'll get them growing up really nice right now there's brine shrimp in there so you that's what you see floating is uh frozen brine shrimp so i was able to capture some small footage a little bit closer of the fish so let's just go to some b-roll right now and you guys check them out how they look again if you haven't subscribed to the channel subscribe

friend to tell a friend have a blessed day [Music] you", "OXhlb1XB8EE": "hey guys we're hanging out in Langley Canada and I'm actually with a shop tech actually you run the whole shop in land you don't use any cycles yeah okay Wow upgrade that's pretty awesome this is Jason you seem to be really knowledgeable he sounds like you spent a whole year in bicycle school at full time here in Canada yeah I did yes I've been learning from this guy and it's a lot of fun this has been really a great experience because we're looking at two very similar bikes from Cube so over here we have the touring Pro 400 okay and it's an interesting bike because it comes in a deep wave a trapeze mid step that's what I call it or high step diamond and with the the different frame geometry and the different layout of tubing you get different characteristics so like a high step might be stiffer yes good to hang it off the back of your car using that top - right yeah but you're gonna have to swing that leg pretty high yes especially if you have it going over that rear carrier look at this I mean this is a great carrier by the way it's got like a paneer hanger right here that you can clip on standard gauge tubing it's it's welded like I guess the support for it is welded directly to the frame and then they have this adapter plate on top maximum 25 kilograms that's 55 pounds it's got the spring latch that's inset so if you do use a trunk bag it's not pushing into the bag and maybe wearing it out over time you've got an integrated light back here you've got an integrated head light up at the front Aimable it is mounted to the suspension arch so if that's going up and down and you're on really bumpy terrain you could get a little bit of jitter with your lighting versus if it was up here however it won't really fit because we have the large and wonderful Bosch into via display panel I love this display because it is removable like this you could take it with you it's got a little micro USB port built into the side so you could actually run like a GPS or maybe an additional headlight if you wanted to kind of stuck down there right now I think about that for commuting when you have to park outside it does rain around here and sometimes even if people are being careful their bike bar scrapes into your bike it happens it happens so let's let's - over here for a minute this is this is a complimentary bike also from cube they have a huge lineup of bikes by the way and I remember I saw that was the 400 they offer a very similar bike in 500 yes it's for the higher capacity battery yes yeah it makes a huge difference in in range especially if you're someone who's maybe using that higher level of assists climbing a lot of hills that kind of thing so down here this one also uses the 400 watt hour battery pack it doesn't have fenders it doesn't have any graded lights this suspension you'll notice that there isn't a compression and lock out clicker and it's also not an air fork this is just a coil fork I imagine it offers similar travel that one was 63 millimeters of travel I believe this one is 50 to 60 millimeters of travel so a little bit less travel in the same sort of range it might even I'm not I don't know about the weight sorry guys I forgot the way it but we did weigh that one and it's 52 pounds and considering that it has all those like the fixin's and that welded on rack that's not bad no that's quite respectable and easy to ride it is yeah it the handling is good because the weight is low it's centered it looks it blends in I mean even this one you can see that this is the a Bosch active line plus motor and they've done a great job of sort of yeah you know black frame right so it matches the black casing there's even like a skid plate both bikes have that now that FSA alloy chain guard that acts as like a almost like a cover in a way your pants might slough over that versus touching the chain and it keeps the chain from bouncing off track you got the plastic sticker here to keep your frame intact and then a plastic sticker on the down tube as well there's a lot of a lot of love that went into this in this cool battery case cover that we're gonna get into in a minute but coming back to the fork it's a little bit downgraded you don't have the lights you don't have the fenders the tires they aren't quite as nice these are a little bit more like off-road style versus sort of a city slick right so that would be more of a pavement specific tire and these fall more into the cyclocross category yeah and it's interesting to see that and they named the bikes differently so this is the cross one and just like you're saying cycle cross that's right right to me this is an interesting use of a very similar frame and a similar motor system similar battery and I think it speaks to the strengths of both the trapeze and the high-step yes okay and the stiffness because they don't offer this one in a step through no no this is only offered in the two frame styles a traditional high-stepper what some people would call a men's frame and the the trapeze frame they call it like easy ride right I don't like that easy access easy access they say who you talk to and I want to I want to call out here instead of having the battery right here on the downtube they actually move it over here to the seat tube area and again that's over on the other bike I just I wanted to call this out because this bikes like $600 cheaper I mean it might be a good option you could always do a beam rack or you know try to add something yourself they don't really have the bosses set up they do have bosses down here for like a cafe lock that they do give you the the brace on the threaded mounts at the rear okay a simple mono stay adapter off of the seat post allows you to run a standard rear carrier that's a really good point and thank you for calling that out because yeah I really don't like the beam racks too much you can kind of bump them when you're getting on the bike leave out but they're very weight limited and if you're riding your seat up a little bit higher for example I'm at the minimum insertion gear you run the risk with weight on a skinny seat post actually bending the seat post interesting interesting Wow okay so this I told you guys he's an expert so let's go back over to this bike this one's great for commuting probably in this configuration you'd probably get some vendor rattle although they are fairly well connected even connecting on the rack right here you could probably take this on bump your train or maybe a little bit of trail I mean that's a cycle cross the tires are better but it's the same frame it is yes the same frame so that's that's kind of cool comfort wise this one's this one's definitely the winner I was talking about the compression with lockout air she can sag it lower the air pressure if you're lightweight like me the fork itself weighs a let a little bit less and then back here we've got a suspension seatpost only 40 millimeters our travel and the post itself so only 300 millimeters so you were talking how tall are you Jason almost five foot ten five foot ten Oh Pam I'm about five nine okay so I'm also raising my seat up we're both pretty active riders willing to get that full leg extension and look at you got the helmet with like the water protector and like all the gear he had his gloves on earlier and I was like Jason is it cold and he's like I know right without my gloves it's just one of my thing I love that yeah so it's again like high level stuff I want to call out a bottle cage bosses on on the top tube right there you could use those for a folding lock or mini pump or nothing and you could get a little bag and you know just unclip the bag take it with you inside we've got a comfortable selling Royale look in gel saddle and you can look in and literally see and feel the gel that's kind of nice so there's a lot of comfort touch points ergonomic grips up here rubber locking we've got hydraulic disc brakes I appreciate that you know and these are like three finger levers a little bit of adjustment on the reach 180 millimeter rotor up front dual piston calipers kind of standard 160 in the rear quick-release on both so that's the 9 millimeter axle with a quick-release skewer and then they have this kickstand here and it to me it looks like a heavy kickstand I can't say for sure cuz cube brands a lot of their stuff themselves but it stays up it's not one of those annoying kickstands that like it you know the mean the minute you move the bike it wants to fling up I appreciate that the kickstand is also adjustable as well a little bit of adjustable height yeah a length you can adjust the length depending on the fit so if your bike is just whist it that is so convenient you don't have to have your tool kit like you're on yeah very easy but tell me about this other brake levers this is something I've been calling out the adjustable reach thing yes it's not like it's just like they can come in further without before you had barrel adjustment something mechanical so you're simply adjusting the starting point of that brake leaver so let's say for example somebody who's gonna ride the same brakes but a smaller Hanson I do yeah to be able to bring those brake levers in yes you're adjusting nothing more than the literal reach and so it's like you still have to go out to get them but then they they stay closer in that's not like you're trying to get leverage when the braking gotta finish right here at Sears are fully extended you can't generate a lot of grab you know who that's also relevant for people who wear gloves yeah it's not like padded you're losing a little bit here so I think that's really cool again nicer nicer like accessories here they got the rubber flap the rear fender there's a little bit of wiggle here but the cool thing about plastic is that they can get bumped they're not gonna get permanently bent like alloy I'm not gonna weigh as much and they're gonna get rusty like steel exactly if it gets scratched so this is perfect for Canada and parts of parts of the country where it might rain a little bit more and then I'm guessing here but I'm I'm feeling pretty confident that this tapered head tube is is this tapered yeah it is it is tapered so you could potentially upgrade the suspension to something like hardcore if you wanted especially on the the cyclecross version over there you know get get your air fork or whatever maybe a loft something like that carbon fiber have you seen this that would be quite nice that would be amazing out of a maze and it matches the bike really well so coming back to this one right probably sealed bearing headset probably sealed bottom bracket I think Bosch has their own like mini Isis splines type of thing that yes it's based off the Isis platform but it's not exactly Isis yeah interesting German engineer it's like the Sony situation where they're like mini discs and everyone else is like DVD right whatever so I don't know but I do like Bosch they have a great warranty it's like - your comprehensive they're battery packs are modular if you have the power packs and this does have the power pack 400 we'll get to that in a second this motor is measuring rear-wheel speed with that magnet and this sensor it's measuring pedal cadence and pedal torque over a thousand times per second and the active line weighs 7.05 pounds versus 8.8 on the performance line so it's sort of like you know you're making a little bit smaller I just love the integration here because I've seen so many of these new active line plus motors that's just got the bubble shape and it doesn't look quite as beautiful as this does this is this is tight it's very quiet when you pedal backwards the chain actually moves it's it's a standard sized chain ring 38 - ther and I don't know you don't have you can pedal beyond like the maximum supported speed of 32 miles or 32 kilometers yes 20 miles per hour right it doesn't it doesn't have the the car the drag the reduction dragon and to me that's never been a huge deal but I want to hear your honest opinion what do you think on the perf honestly having ridden the CX motor for the last several years and now being out riding the active line I miss a little bit the the torque at the rear wheel yeah but coming more from a mountain background right i I do like that that higher punch of power but I have to tell you this is quiet yeah it's smooth it delivers power really it is usually it can climb it can what do we are we gonna I think we're gonna try rolling land that thing in there yeah it so I'm with you thank you for that perspective having tried many bikes yourself so coming back to other things I feel like we've covered most of it but it looks like there's a bit more of a rise on that stem maybe like 15 degrees and we got a bunch of spacer so you could flip it and you could lower it there's a lot of adjustment that can be done the stand over height on this one's a little bit lower and with that rack if that's loaded up you don't want to like hit your shin trying to like swing over so I actually really like the mid step trapeze frames I mainly makes it like a whole lot more rideable for a wider variety of people for sure for sure and that means you and maybe a significant other a friend or someone who might be a little less comfortable with oh my gosh electric bike it's powerful oh is it safe I haven't been riding a bike it's like look you got reflective sidewalls puncture resistant tires integrated lights so even though it's black to help blend in like the drive system yeah it's still a really I think pretty visible bike I think the big thing the trapeze frame lends itself to is frame stiffness yeah your true low step frames tend to almost feel a little bit rain wax that's right yeah so you get the the benefit of being able to step off the seat flat foot and not worry about where your undercarriage is uh-huh but you still have a nice stiff frame so performance and access very well said Jason I think at this point unless you can think of anything I was gonna go through the display no I I think that's a great idea we do that okay cool so I love this compared to the period for me that's a that's a big upsell you can actually install into via for a pure Aeon bike yes you can't it's just like 200 bucks or something so it's a little bit of a you know and then you're like well I've already paid 200 you know for another 400 you get all this other stuff yeah but anyway so the display press the power button comes on very quickly five ticks on that battery infographic if you I suppose ten or a percentage or something but they do have a range estimate to which is really dynamic so if I press the plus button over here to go to the lowest level of assist eco it says eighty eight miles you know we're pretty full charged here maybe it could go ninety but you're really not getting a whole lot of support it's very limited helps to offset the weight of the bike and you know just give you a little bit of a boost as you click up to turbo who drops way down to thirty eight miles which you know that's still pretty good in my opinion and that's back to the efficiency of new things we'll also remember that it's constantly recalculating that yeah so it's gonna sample what you're doing at any given time versus what the the drain on the motor is or the strain on the motor is and it'll give you a live a live readout of what your approximate ranges yeah it's fantastic it is and because you and I we might paddle differently or way more that's right you know have more gear you got the wind resistance going on yeah whatever it's create it's really sweet to have that to help you my preferred window to have it on what I'm riding that system that's great yeah great feedback I like it too and then there's this power like chart that you can't really see right now cuz we're not riding if we press the I button here or here it cycles through some trip stats and then there's this light button which activates the headlights just pretty cool so you know here's the front light I haven't actually tried it in super dark it doesn't look like the world's brightest light to me and it's sort of got this interesting beam pattern but it does have the side visibility which is nice so you increase your visual footprint and then the rear light it's positioned out of the way and it's got the integrated reflectors so they're doing they're doing good on that and then there's a little light icon I'm just gonna press the I button and show you some of the rest of these stats here so we got odometer you trip distance clock max speed average speed trip time and then back to range you know this button pad is really easy to reach and you can almost navigate it without looking at it because it's a sort of tactile and there's this rubber eye button here and it you hear it click right so I like this and actually liked it more than the Peary on the pier I on looks like this but the buttons they click inward whereas this Clips downward and these are more consistent in my experience and then yeah I mean just the removability all that other stuff do you have anything to add about the display no I think you pretty much covered it I just touch back on the fact that the display is removable yeah so for security standpoint if you park your bike and you go in somewhere you pop the display off stick it in your pocket that's a good point or if you're someone who you know for a lot of demo events for electric bikes there's actually like a set screw and there you can permanently a fix it yes well not permanently someone's definitely semi-permanently there we go prevents somebody just walking by and pocketing it yeah which would be sad but you know our kid just having fun and they thrown it in the field and how it does we're gonna go in that field later too soon to find let's do the let's do the battery thing here because we actually brought the key and check this out this really reminds me of like the mustache bikes not only is there a plastic cover but it's paint matched so it matches this blue this dark blue color really nice high quality stuff there's a button down here that you press this little plastic thing and then I think you just kind of slide it down and then lift up at the top a little bit pull it off so there's our old friend the power pack for and remember they do have a 500 watt hour version of this battery - if you want and maybe you have an older Bosch car bike you could swap the batteries or you could travel with this bike because lithium-ion batteries you're not really allowed to fly with them you could borrow or rent a battery on on-site there's the keyhole right there and then we've got this little rubber grommet so you can charge on or off the bike I recommend charging you know every month or two if you haven't ridden the bike keeping that battery away from extreme temperatures the heat and the cold can sort of diminish your capacity or even wear the cells out over time certainly can absolutely okay especially in Canada it's like you can get pretty cold and then it can get pretty warm and yeah and right and so we just imagine like the stresses that are happening these batteries are kind of expensive - if I gave they countdown perhaps US dollars Canadian retail price were rain around 11 or 1150 Wow yeah but they are pretty reliable they are incredibly reliable I've only ever had to replace one and it wasn't actually a warranty issue as a customer care issue okay so you know as far as warranties are concerned they're quite so don't drop it don't drop it don't don't put it in the bathtub right it's not a good idea out of good idea people okay will you do the do the honors here sure so Jason has the key I'm gonna go to this other side nearly 180 degree turn and then the battery comes straight up yeah I'd be careful if you're trying to pull especially on the trapeze frame if you hit this a bunch you're gonna scratch up your battery no one will notice because you have that cover but I your heart your heart will notice and then right here there's a handle so you don't drop it there's the plug this one I believe that comes with the 2 amp charger which is a little bit lighter yes more of a value play you know Bosch has a 4 amp charger which is nice but I mean this is the value bike right in some ways even though this is a step up from the one across one over there I think that's about it there's even some some space in here for dust and crumbs and things to fill up so peachy you might want to keep an eye on that it looks like it might pass through and water can probably drain a little bit I'm sure they've done a good job the cabling as a shop that you know you do service a lot of these bikes so how do you access to the cables is that nice it is it's quite nice you know being able to feed new cables down through the frame without having to fight in person Square and yeah we don't have that right and it's especially with this one having lights and everything too there's a little bit more going on there is yeah anytime we can have easier access to the frame at the end of the day it's a lower cost to the end consumer coming back in for those kind of services that's a great point we love it we love it ok let's put the battery back on and we'll just take a little ride that's cool I've never seen one of those before you can vote yeah and you can kind of like interact with a camera or oh yeah unreal this portable you just this one's a bummer cuz you got to watch out for that that knob thing oh yeah or it'll right now it's on follow mode and that'll like lock it so I had to relearn my old one wasn't water-resistant and it did eventually break just stopped it got fried so how about this you take off I'll follow you will go around the swirly thing and then at the top before we get to the road like somewhere on that that one that deck on the top of top deck but not near the road put it back up stow that kickstand and I step through the other thing is that bike doesn't have a kickstand so we had to lean it up against the sign sweet it's going pretty well feels pretty stable these tires are 28 by 1.75 so they have a lower attack angle just more efficient it's a good city size but the air volume it's it's more of a high pressure tire setup and that's where the suspension seatpost and suspension fork really shine hey guys getting ready to take off you can see the chain 38 to chain ring with an FSA alloy a guard I love that it's gonna protect your pants a little bit and it acts as a guide because of where the motor is positioned and then back here 11 to 42 teeth that's a pretty great range for like a city bike like this I usually see it on a mountain bikes and stuff Shimano Deore and it has the one weight clutch so it's gonna tighten up if you want to or you can put it down to service the wheel it's gonna make the quick-release easier to work with love the plastic slap guard here cube does a great job there's even a plastic slap guard on the base of the downtube just to keep rocks and stuff from from hitting it and you even have fenders so it's kind of overkill but I wanted to point you down here so you could see and hear the motor in action when I pedal I'm gonna be using the highest level of assist and the cool thing about the active line plus motor is that you can pedal backwards to do drivetrain service if you want to there's a little bit of resistance but it's something you couldn't do on the performance line motors worked up pretty well and these actually have shift detection so when I was shipping gears supposed to ease off a little bit and just reduce the mashing potential so from here maybe you can see the suspension a little bit I just wanted to point out that it's 63 millimeters of travel it's an air force so you can sag it you know and hit you're sort of your body weight I'm a little bit of a lighter weight rider so I like that it's definitely a nicer fork keeps the bike lighter to about 52 pounds total for this one then again the Bosch motor here this active line it only weighs like 7.05 pounds versus 8.8 on the performance line however this one doesn't support you up to 120 rpm it only goes up to like 105 so it just means if you're pedaling too fast for the motor you're you're gonna drop support and then you need to change gears in the back and slow your cadence not a huge deal something that you know for a city bike like this it's it fits and it's just so quiet yeah feelin very smooth and the brakes are working great 180 up front hundred and sixty in the rear hydraulic so there to actuate it's not a lot of hand strength and the motor just starts and stops so quickly it's really responsive feels very natural and I love how topped in it is on this frame beautiful man you out of breath no the bike did most of the work that's awesome are you in turbo mode here was I cheated me got a cheater oh my gosh well we rode here from the shop it's just it's been a beautiful day we haven't been getting rained on which is really nice thank you for your insights your absolute pleasure yeah yeah excellent excellent background and experiences to draw from and it's just it's a pleasure again he works at the city cycles shop in Langley Canada you got it okay well awesome I've done my best to your guys but feel free to give me some feedback if I miss something or if you want to see something I didn't quite cover I've got all the specs and really deep details back at the site along with several other like cube reviews I'll keep doing this the full written review electricbikereview.com have fun ride safe we'll see you next time see you guys", "Ae0QcezLnpg": "how's it going I got some cali blue blue dream yes I know I do a lot of cali one all right let's fire this [ __ ] up and I'll give you my opinion it's not a bit it's not too bad there's a lot of chemical after days on this one add to my coughing I'm like i said i'm not a chemical guy i don't mind using chemicals in the growing process but you gotta purge your plants before you harvest them this one feels like it's going to be more of a pain reliever than anything but who knows we'll see one more in for the road guys alright thank you and I'll see you on the next vid", "etTdVHKACFg": "hey whistling that Sims wishes here and welcome to another episode of The Sims 4 randomly genetic household challenge I know it's been a while since I've been on here and it's moving into my new house I'm finally back and we're excited to get back into some more Sims videos and in this episode I wanted to create a blue hybrid family so mum dad and we're going to have six kids as well so they're going to be two routine two children and two toddlers but in this series what we do is we randomly generate every member of this household and then give them a bit of a makeover what we do is we roll five times for each person we create in this family they're completely randomly generated but they've all got to be blue so to do that I need to pair a sim with a blue alien now aliens come in a couple of shades of blue when I roll five times I'm only going to count the blue aliens as the count so blue this is a dark blue earth canada's blue is an aqua blue there's also a light blue so they're all considered to be blue as long as every person in the family is blue go blue skin they're going to be counted as rock all right well let's get started so we're going to create the mum first let's see what we get so we have to randomly generate these guys per so five roll one two three four five oh pretty nothing I want to say as well as I don't edit anything that's randomly generated on their body and thus like their body shape their face shapes and facial features that all stays the same will only change hairdo and clothing okay she's pretty cool all right let's move on so that roll one two three that's about a potato blue blue green means we won't count that hold that one Capri one role for that role for next blue one will be it was fun photos are we're getting rid of couples there we go all right like an apple blue cool all right now we go to randomly generate the mum from these two now we're only going to choose the ones that are human and blue as part of the role so this lovely alien work counts so let's see how we go okay let's see there we go not wrong over one and get another wrong whole number to live people all over three or what about pink I showed up awesome whole number four okay one more and then that's going to be the mum oh there she is that's the mum how cute is she I'm going to save section how I create my sin I randomly generate them with genetics and then give them a maker this is legit how I do it so she's pretty cool now let's give her a makeover so she's a mum another thing I like to do is I kind of like to try and stick with a style they're randomly generated with but I wanted to match so what I'm going to do I quite like that jacket and skirt thing but I'm going to change the colors the suit I'm gonna keep the red hair she's running my hair out of his red hair red hair and we're going to make it work for her we're going to get work so red jacket with the red hair it looks awesome know that boots I want to get these groups in a color that's suit who that's okay I reckon we could do better let's see what these ones look like that's pretty cool and with a little strap in the back or is that too much is red you could always surfaces black through now that little - oh my gosh and I'm very indecisive all the real little boot size data post cool shape those boobs so me to add more expansion pack to get and more choices you have and then the harder it becomes a two and ones you want okay but those ones they're pretty young and if either too bright at the top those groups white boots could be cool hmm red boots I mean I don't know feeling maybe boots and not the right choice maybe we just went with some so this is the everyday outfit something like this might be fine or even in white mean a white or black oh yeah I think black let's go with black and now let's give us a makeup to match her outfit I might add some to actually that's a little read I'm going to see what is there any good little earrings it'll massive a black maybe sort of just tiny little black studs or red studs or even white clothes why start to quite fall I'll see this black if there's any black ones anywhere that we can try that out there are any actually maybe some of these one mm maybe stick with the black studs is kind of little white one yeah that's cool alright Allan's a locket necklace is this one type of little dripping that close could look cool black feel maybe a red one they're gonna plain silver one that tool I chose red one too much too much okay I'm just a white simple yeah and I'm which is it earrings white earrings and white necklace alright alright let's do a some makeup let's see what we final get some eyeliner going always over this one it always looks nice now lips you can even go full on red lips which yeah it might be a bit much hey we went live like a Maroni colored lip so it's like slightly darker a bit shiny like super dark screw the dog which is kind of cool as well when she is she's the mom so listen or I could just put a little bit of gloss on that could look cool ah ah we went with her skin tone anyone go for blue so you'd be surprised how well that can work all look black and um yeah maybe not all you can have this little pink little look here okay I might go with a gloss but maybe a darker take a little dark gloss there so type of darker blue and I see if any blush will work with the skin atomium for the files blue skin tone it can be hard to get a blush this looks just right you see can you do that that kind of makes a cool effect of a flatter face but you might be a bit too harsh yes you can't even see that one but it's like is it worth it it was even worth doing that or you can go stand a blush can I can look alright but no I think not alright working on people just like that nice and simple and pretty it's a classy lady classy month okay I was new on formalwear okay my stuff and scratch here so I'm feeling I have a long red ball gown for her I love that one and I saw that one is like yep gotta be that one after we're a real or bracelet hmm red ring to be nice as simple or a still just a silver ring of one of these lines the red stone in the middle yeah let's go with that one and that's awesome okay and her makeup I think we can go for a bolder lip with this outfit and maybe some winged liner it would be cool we cool winged liner and the wings at Shadowrun what to say this let's go dark ellipse maybe Oh should we go that pink is to make me like a Moroni red okay hair beautiful okay athletic all right let's put something together and go obviously I'm going with a red theme it just seems to work for her otherwise the blue skin and too much see if you get a blue you just blend too much okay let's find a little road like this one and some pants match or you just and slap on grey one hmm one sees one gray its God blue gray underneath - topped it there she's got any good running shoes how many months okay with those I feel like you want some shorts and you want some shorts black short they're okay with that and maybe you have the hair looks like white pretty like that serve backwards cat now is it too young isn't it mmm not beyond that let's turn it on right here Red Hat or should we throw what black hat as a black shirt off yeah black hat cool sleepwear all right let's go with oh one piece could be full something elegant what this yeah let's go an estimate thing like an elegant lady party where we could go to set outfit like that I like that that's cool I'm sure she's a trendy young mom it was awesome okay shoes there we go about that up cute and I'll give it a little my bracelet bangles and some kind of necklace maybe maybe the necklace will need to is that too much now you'll take the bracelet off too much the bracelet just to go with that tool and make up like make it make it up with the makeup okay liner and I think we go and dark our eyes we've got outfit yeah like that oh let's try the other ones out okay that's maybe fit true dog hmm oh you know it was like it no it just does not look good against blue skin that does you can barely see it [Music] I'm thinking maybe the black eyes are get to pong this is good you punk looking for her okay I heard that subtle pretty love it okay let's give her one piece this one piece is a great you just fun this one I like that one wall awesome okay now we're going to randomly generate a name I'm going to click 5 times see what we get 1 2 3 4 5 Breanna let's see last name 1 2 3 4 5 Amaya all right oh my - oh she still a team let's add row to another last time one lobster knees you still look pretty much the same very lovely both live really generated certain she's pretty tricky kick-out all right we're going to randomly generate the tropes as well so I'm going to start I've got a little randomly random generator app thing it's a few sensor and I'm going to put in the amount of traits there are and will spit out a number and see what we get so sometimes I'll count from the front sometimes account to the back so we never quite know what we'll get all right let's see what we get I've got number eight so I'm going to cap in the back one two three four five six seven eight is good one other ways a good start isn't it I was

enjoy this episode please like share and subscribe and have you swimming everyone", "GkUQY1Hxnu0": "the new bmw m3 and m4 and my Kiner cars rear-wheel drive 425 brake horsepower and nought to 62 in around four seconds they both look great sound hot and offer the kind of sex appeal performance and driver involvement that you give your left clutch foot for as actual machines however there's nothing new to see here three litres of turbocharged straight six launches two car forwards and sideways while sprinklings of carbon fibre helped keep weight down and center of gravity low they're both remarkable vehicles in isolation but compared to BMWs new flagship sports car vi8 they are also very unremarkable to start with the i8 looks like something only reserved for blockbuster movies it's striking and fascinating with curves and scoops designed to make the sports car of the future super slippery it's the type of car that takes a while to warm to aesthetically which if I'm honest is something I'm still working on that face why more from Pokemon am i right and look at that the i8 has actually eaten or is trying to give birth to a Porsche 911 you got it yeah once you've seen that it cannot be unseen underneath all of that striking air tunnel bravado sits something truly amazing at a back of the i8 you will find a conventional 1.5 liter 3-cylinder engine it sits underneath here somewhere there's lots of bolts and knots in the way I can get to it it's also the same engine that you'll find in the new mini except that this one has got a little bit more power in fact it's got a ridiculous amount power 228 brake horsepower and 236 profit of talk from an engine with only three cylinders barring a - probably only that big that is an obscene amount and that engine drives the rear wheels at the front of the car we have got an electric motor it sits underneath here and it powers the front wheels that makes this car when you've got your foot flat to the floor four-wheel drive now thanks to a total combined output 357 brake horsepower 420 pound-feet of torque the i8 will run north to 62 in just 4.4 seconds and is also good for 155 miles an hour limited the most impressive fact however is that it achieves these types of figures while also achieving 135 mpg and wait for it 49 g/km of co2 that is my news for a bit of context 49 g/km of co2 is roughly the same amount that I am it every time I yawn look oh boy they grow so covered in co2 and all that from a hybrid sports car good for 4.4 seconds so then a mini engine in the fact that turns the rear wheels an electric motor doing the donkey work up front and more Road presence than a GTR yeah I went there so what's it like to drive now the first thing you notice with the i8 is the noise that's a really really good noise and all of that remember from a 1.5 liter triple that sits behind me for a three cylinder engine that is absolutely astonishing it's rami its base see it sounds way more like a v6 or even a v8 that is really impressive seriously impressive away from the awesome engine noise you will also be very pleased to hear the horn yep as you can hear that's typical BMW horn which is something that BMW drivers pay particular attention to BMW drivers need a strong horn it's like a firm hand to say to people move hasn't move out of my way I am coming through in the i8 and you get that the car is edgy is completely different it's like nothing else you've ever seen it's like something straight out of terminator it is that futuristic I mean even little things like looking the rearview mirror and just seeing the curves on this thing this car has been designed in a wind tunnel the wings on this they kind of art shop like that it's like a couple of elbows just pointing up it looks weird from these mirrors all diseases Elba shares hold this you think they look like Elvis is all right we'll go with Elvis years all I'm seeing is Elvis is inside the i/os cabin you have got every single thing that you want from a hundred thousand pound sportscar there is leather there is magnesium behind the dashboard this steering wheel is nice and small it's for a steering wheel that's actually really attractive I mean have a look at this dashboard as well swooping lines there and there and you've got you know the usual kind of infotainment system and I've also got BMW idrive the interior is airy it's fresh the seats supportive and they're really really pretty it's magnificent now as an out-and-out sports car BIA absolutely nails it it is feel so it goes like the clappers it looks spectacular it's noisy it's ah it's just amazing this thing rides smoothly but it writes confidently as four-wheel drive it doesn't weigh a lot it doesn't feel like it weighs a lot it's simple it's poised for me this is the best sports car that money can buy at the moment granted it should be for a hundred grand but as a complete package this is it this is the future this is the future and I'm in it you", "a6KMj1SUgxA": "camera stand Oh lazy [ __ ] today we're going over Liberty Health Sciences blue dream click review feel free to smoke along sorry I forgot to say that oh so flavorful so flavorful this bug is very good at least looking on this on this all day look at the color that little bit leafy for my liking oh sorry got a trimmer these are uncontrollable trimmers from the spinal cord injury that's one of the main reasons our tables make medical marijuana oh yeah I also wanted to say that distillates and the Turks started working amazing I haven't taken any of that so I was waiting to talk to my shower I mixed some of that and made a little bit from what cartridge that takes a pure tangi just oh shout out to search art take a dick a quick step a screenshot of that if you don't have a good idea of a turf chart those flavors and smells are what gives you an indication of what the natural flower is doing you know if you got like a earthy woody herbal that's like a human lien so that's gonna be good for like anti-inflammatory appetite suppressant pain relief anti tumour the humans specifically so those earthy or woody flavors are like good for like you know different types of things like that so you know each each one like the pining and my mayor scene and my Moline each have their own areas you know there's different flavors do different things like a spicy or woody or peppery will usually be a pain relief antidepressant anti-inflammatory and anti-tank so each one is a little different like I said take a screen shot of that and definitely study it you can oftentimes determine from your taste buds what the each each individual herb is good for this blue dream is giving me some very floral slightly sweet hints of uh maybe like a spicy or wittiness on the tail end of it but mostly floral and sweet so yeah good stuff amazing can't say enough about their delivery crew Mike shout out to the driver and everybody on the delivery end from their internet crew to their phone service they've all been amazing I've got the delivery here within 24 hours which is what I always hope for and you know sometimes it doesn't happen and sometimes it happens faster than that like when one last week was in 12 hours I need to give them a video about their reception time but we'll talk more about that next week I'm definitely gonna be doing a video about how long it takes for some companies and other companies to get deliveries to you and what that means for patients like me who are paralyzed and cannot just drive down to your local store any time or day of the week and just pick these products up like like anybody so anyway that's it a day for waiting alone signing off not for long peace", "o5eKFJ34il0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hi everyone welcome to the channel my name's CJ and today we're going to be taking a look at Josh's amazing style at GT turbo these cars came out in the early 90s and in my opinion are a little bit of a Forgotten pocket rocket featuring a 1.3 turbo coming out with around about 130 brake horsepower from stop but today's example is nearer to 50 so let's speak to Josh see how he's done that and take it out and see what you guys think on the road if you like the content today don't forget to Like share and subscribe so 250 brake some 800 wait let's see what she can do in a straight line okay guys so we are now in the GT turbo my first time in one of these and it is a little tight but you would expect that for by just such a it's such a small yeah but they look small from the outside they get even smaller inside haven't if you own this little B so I bought it from a track on Lewis in Manchester last May so I'd spend probably well over a year or a year and a half looking for one I wanted that was the right kind of mileage it's panic as we said before my hairdresser had one of these and the Pulsar no way and there he had a white one of these and I saw it when I got my hair can i fulfill the hell I really like I never really see mom I've got chatted about to in thought I'm gonna try to get one every time I went for a haircut every couple of weeks have you got one yet no no no that went on for a good nearly two years yeah I finally found my the in what it was worth it's super clean yeah I like I think whilst you can still find these cars around that their value really is rising quite quickly this is a super nice look up on there's not many about now a lot of them seem to rust or people have done dodgy paintwork or Fela blown and mark or there's always something stuck there about 130 year roughly I think it's 132 or so mile and not not too much but for a little walk went three that was made for kind of economy with a bit of power they've brilliant been kidding well I was really impressed actually like obviously we were chatting before the video to show some of the differences between the Galarza said the latest spec star look at this one and this kind of actually sounds like the one to have it does everyone wants the fans I don't know this just because they're more modern they look a bit more aggressive I'm already sure that he's been wanting to go for the year as we said by the grandeur has different stock thinner con rocks yeah compared to the GT turbo so if you're looking for like budget power that's more reliable one of these is an ideal your engine might wanna take a little time yeah so see this is I'm forward to making 245 breaks all the time so see what does it take to you get to that sort of power because the route that you've got is quite a sort of well dreaded rear so to get to like 180 200 brake it doesn't really take a lot but for to get to the power level I'm at now I've had to go hybrid tdo for which is the super turbo running a bar boost cool there's still stock injectors so there's enough fuel in there you know I mean you're on the limit but there's enough fuel that's theory so we're basically done HDI from man which is really big from Anning who worked at replace because knowing they were like stock they had a top mounted in for the Hoodman we brown all of the manifold kit with the tire looks that always goes to scream the screen I think the scream of pipe makes a noise did you realize this an Escrima pipe on it yeah when did I do oh yeah that's good okay yeah I like a scream of money so from a hundred and thirty break to 250 issue or two four five yeah so you're looking at it like how much is that gonna cost maybe some of us to start at tomorrow once you've got the turbo rebuild done everything else off so you need last month ECU as well but the gradient manage lights through interpret whether you manage blue is just a fuel give you back to you not looking at much really it's kind of Miriam holders technology now yeah so I think in the future I would go women a me to t1 now inside the more standalone but yeah you know a new look I know you grant relief get it up there but not a lot and if you want to do it properly like this with a quite Philistine stuff oxy price goes up but I handles so much better because these way less than the collateral do I think why they're round Sigma think about sixty kilos less of something because the plans aways 950 in these way 8/9 you stop impressively carefully I think not enough people look at the measure fast car in there grows old against the stuff on that and all the crab use if well begging elves the most modern cars now you get a 300 pound map and you've just gained a hundred dollars here it's as simple as that you take it someone they map it you you laughter you don't have to spend any money but in my opinion for those who know this just turns heads more just does it oh there's something about all the cars they drive different completely they got that kind of present doesn't have I don't think there's really many new Fiesta zhim would go past me and I think off I see you laughs yeah we machine I'll pop some bangs man yes actually her retinas pops at night for the thingy this kind of fun when you're in something this learning in 30 years old the upsetting cars that are mob plays anymore yeah cuz I think a lot of people really won't know what these are not really because they won't ever sold the UK so less and less people know where they are there's the same like ae86 when I take that places people you say oh I've got her older and they think they just think of this little front-wheel drive yeah awesome real the drive money boosted car but people just don't know that all the checking stuff and everything but they're now starting to creep up advance more people are kind of like cuz I mean this cars probably worth like what six seven grand man yes I know how you did six for it with a lot of this stuff already done make sense so because I wanted I thought shall I spend the extra money I'm doing my cell phone if someone's done a lot of the work for I don't have to worry I can then carry on from where they've left off there is a lot of benefits to that like modifying a car it doesn't generally add the value that they cost you to modify at all does it go I think the only downside is you don't really know the quality of the work that they exactly that's the risk you take yeah you just got a risk it really and just can I hope for the best I can help yarn and I roasting it like me what we have is just loads of stuff the Japan like a massive folder full of just all the details like we had like the export details and bits and pieces like that and it's basically just a massive list of stuff he'd done service and stuff he'd had done you got bits in here right just silly little stuff really and there was I suppose it's kind of hard to even tell like a lot of is just history like yeah it's that date back to I have no idea I'm not Japanese enough so no yeah but this is like kind of like just the little toyota booklets you get like service booklets and stuff that's such a cool little thing so they're just so random yeah they're really cool and that all came with the car it's nice just to see some history with it really because a lot of these it's like you said a lot of the Japanese import stuff you don't get much history they just come in and that's that so it's quite nice to have some history with it and you've got I think it's in here you have a full style at book oh my god which is pretty cool which had everything in its Lizzy like the owner's manual I know it's like brand-new and the crazy thing is I have Marlo's tape decks start original start tape deck in my cupboard at home that came out of this Carnot but oh you just didn't fancy using tapes anymore didn't work for some reason hollow so I pulled it apart and decided are I like listens music I'm just gonna put an old stereo in yeah I still have that part at home I'll mate Wicked's is there's a gritty turbo time and down here when you turn it on it just that makes this little jingle if it didn't have an LS they even for you one will spend them all the time there just be no problem tell you what we'll help ya you buy fine during a win see this I felt very high on yeah you did the white I don't know if I just buzz these things are so let's show ya I think the stock seats are so springy on there you kinda feel about from absolutely yeah I mean I don't feel like ridiculously stupid my eyes these were just meant to be like nil see cars were they were like they were designed they were like design for Allah and I think that you think well over engine in the edge I mean they must have done you don't because in any car which can kind of take a hundred plus more yeah fairly rely on the weight is free as well as if you forget that don't you laughs yeah you always forget I mean do you think the same as me because do you make your twenty yes I am but when it so be in 1.3 I don't know whether that necessarily means insurance was this is quite an affordable way into Germany enough it is because a lot of people said to me if I got it is going to be really expensive you're gonna have loads of trouble getting insurance sure you pay it's like 14 quid tax so that's nice insurance now this is the difference okay the Glanzer costs seems to cost a fair whack more on insurance isn't that of Scots isn't it is so is the cleansers more common mysamma people are praying they're credible yeah so yeah top tech guys cheap insurance by GT turbo so I pay for years about a hundred quid see for twenty years old so something with this manpower I mean the public health I'd like the 86 cost me thirteen hundred quid I mean ae86 half the pub half the power and everything out or so really isn't easy wait if people have got the money to spend outright and get the car rather than finance a car and it's a no-brainer really a few things I think mainly now he's kind of clean the body woke up as much as I can then look at breaks I think before you can touch power again look this right yeah it's all ready to be sketchy let alone head in another 50 preyed on top I agree mate good place to stop our will do that and then hopefully Forge it over with the newsstand loading in Amanda's vampire to development originally oh cool so ever I'll go back there but there's a place I can't meanwhile they call their in suffering life people their name is I'm sorry to them and they do a me to t12 where writers take you there the closer the easier that's out so good so that's it for today guys hopefully that video was something you really enjoyed and thought it was quite cool to see up close and personal with a Toyota Starlet GT turbo I tried out loads of new equipment today so apologies for some of the audio clipping that we had there I'll be sure to get that right for the next time I'm just such a perfectionist but there was a few clips I just couldn't leave out so like share and subscribe and catch you next time", "GvVmEp9hr_Q": "what's up YouTube is Darrell with Auto dreams so say we're the 2018 hyundai ioniq hybrid now this cart out some pretty empty fuel economy numbers 57 city 59 i way but this was published today we're gonna do a real-world test to see what fuel economy numbers and I'm actually getting might be hard might be Lord but stick around and difficult to find out [Music] okay if you're watching this video you're probably close to making your final decision between the ionic and the Toyota Prius you're probably wondering about the validity of those published fuel economy numbers we all know there is some margin of accuracy there are factors that affect guild economy tire pressure outdoor temperature etc etc so the marznap accuracy in my mind is probably close or minus 10% so on the plus side maybe as much as 63 64 miles to the gallon on the low side maybe 52 53 okay anything outside of that range well if it's more the nicest amazin right I'll take it if it's less then really want to kind understand why am I so far apart from the numbers so let's head over to the gas station filled up the car and calculate we're actually MPT numbers are so the basic form that we're going to use is miles over gallons miles driven divided by number of gallons it took to do those miles now at my previous field up I made sure and reset thee the trip odometer so I know exactly how many miles I've driven over the gallons that I have consumed all right guess few more days have passed into the change of clothes have used almost a full of paint okay all right so Lucy I used nine point eight gallons if you can see it it 9.8 okay and now we will get to see looking at our trip odometer how many miles were driven during that nine point eight gallons all righty so we drove 545 miles 545 miles you see that okay so doing the math mpg equals miles over gallons in this case equals 545 miles over nine point eight gallons and that came up to 55 not bad at all ada actual numbers keep in mind it's gonna be very dependent on outdoor temperature I'm gonna Texas climate what I get through the summer won't be what I get during the winter I hope you enjoyed this video hope you found it informative if you hadn't seen my other video where I talk about what it's like to have the done a ionic hybrid after one year of ownership in miles then I'll drop a link to that video here at the top of this one go ahead and check that out please give the video a thumbs up if you hadn't already subscribe to the channel go ahead and smash that red subscribe button guys and gals I would really appreciate it stay tuned we'll see you on the next week you", "_0u8DvmDbR4": "[Music] all right

gonna be uh smoking cool cucumber it's pretty good all right i already opened it um but i'm gonna be session when i get back because i'm about to get food [ __ ] starving and uh yeah last video i made when i was like taking hits and then driving a lot of people were coming saying like yo why why would you do that why would you drive high like why why wouldn't you do it but it is what it is all right so yeah [Music] all right thank you all right i'm back home i got a smoothie all right last time i [ __ ] saw some comments saying that i talked more about the [ __ ] smoothie than the car so i'm not even going to talk about sweetie i got my food too i'm gonna eat oh my god i thought it just stopped all right like i said i had opened it i haven't scanned it for some reason i'll put in the try to put the little scan thing right here all right i'll try since the [ __ ] roof is [ __ ] dirty oh [ __ ] it's hot as [ __ ] in here i don't know if you're gonna be able to hear the air but yeah it's hot so all right i'm gonna take a hit and then i'm going to continue this video uh inside because it's hot as [ __ ] and i don't want to [ __ ] sweat all right cheers cheers what the [ __ ] am i doing that good but there's some bacon some chicken in there some cheese all right the only thing i don't like is why the [ __ ] do they put those [ __ ] pieces of lettuce eyes and chips the smoothie smoothie [Music] dessert all right so i'm going to continue it here um i just i just crashed it oh i just crashed it and yeah i got authentic i'll try to wait right here i'll try to put the video right here or something but yeah let's take another hit i just finished eating by the way that [ __ ] was good see how my smoothie right here that's good all right cheers this is a this is the car by the way by the way um this is like the first card that i get with like hardly any bubbles it had like a really small bubble i also took a video when i was like opening it up yeah cheers [Music] oh yeah this shit's like [ __ ] with my head because it tastes like nicotine pots or like that flavor but he also has like a little hint of weed so yeah it tastes it tastes a lot of uh it tastes a lot like cucumber i'm not gonna can't it's like the first this is like the first time i ate i ever [ __ ] taste uh cucumber in a cart i don't know it's also like exotic supposedly i don't know pretty good i'm gonna try to take a i'll try to take a good uh a good thumbnail [Music] cheers [Music] [Music] it's a hybrid and i think it's a little bit more of a sativa which kind of makes sense um yeah i don't know if you look at it you wouldn't think it's a it's an indie i don't know but yeah i give it like um a seven out of ten i only like sativas like that and the flavor it's good but i don't know i feel like mohammed's okay they used to have like random ass flavors like i remember they used to have a [ __ ] nesquik or yeah like a [ __ ] nesquik flavor like the chocolate milk and they used to have like hella weird flavors and i feel like later on they stopped doing that and they they focus on like the strains instead of just random flavors so they started coming up with like actual strains but then later on now again we're getting like random ass [ __ ] like [Music] cool uh like cool uh cucumber diablo g like what is this i had ecto cooler as well what is that so yeah i feel like now they're just like mixing [ __ ] and like giving it a name but i don't know i don't know i've been looking [ __ ] with him oh damn bro look at the bubble oh you can't see it but yeah i'm gonna try to take a closer on my phone hold up [Music] it's pretty small wait wait wait wait let's see how fast it moves [Music] i mean it's moving a little bit faster than usual because it's kind of more like it's like really concession on it you know i mean but yeah um honestly it's a good it's a good strain um yeah here's the box it's a good strain it does taste like cucumber which is a little bit weird but yeah okay and also after you scratch it you can also do this to the little sticker so you can try to read the little message they put because they put some thing right here they put something right here and a lot of people get to see it because of the stickers so you can just take it off and it says voip so yeah but yeah this is like an exotic mohammed i don't even know what exotic is about it i mean i guess the flavor i've never [ __ ] tasted cucumber in a car but yeah that's it for the video i'm going to take another hit don't i don't even want to say it but i have to because i know there's someone that's going to be like why don't you take a blinker this [ __ ] blinks like 15-20 seconds all right i'm not gonna do that i'm not even gonna [ __ ] check because i've checked before all right all right cheers take a hit all right [Music] [Music] thank you bye peace out", "lP7B9B7WX1E": "my neighbor asked if I could come over and install new floorings they did a lot of heavy lifting by removing the old carpet they're also happy that the walls were painted and all they needed to do was install the floors right then I knew this was going to be a little miserable in a perfect world I'd like to remove the baseboard because that would make the installation of the new floor much easier this is what it looked like before and here's what it looks like now in this video I'm gonna show how to install these floors but a very first time so if you're a newbie this video is for you before I take you back to the concrete floor I want to thanks today's sponsor Noor board the main reason I started making things is the fact that I enjoy working with my hands and off this job is not for everyone I personally enjoy being in the trenches and taking part of the building process seeing things come together Noor board's mission is to shed some light there's a shortage of framers in the construction industry this is an amazing opportunity that has great pay and there's no college requirement becoming a carpenter is something you can do in a short period of time knowledge is power so picking up a new skill would set you apart I learned to do what I do by trial and error but there's an easier way there's training and apprenticeship programs that you can take part in it's never too late to try something new and it's never too early to start check out become a framer comm slash DIY creators to learn more information on becoming a framer and enter for a chance to win a home depot gift card and its really cool s twing pro framing hammer now if you take the baseboard off this would allow you to run the laminate closer to the wall and eliminate the need for cord around if you don't have the tools or you're intimidated by it all you just don't have the time that's a legit reason to go at the cord around as I said this video is for complete beginners so we're gonna take you all the way back to the basics let's talk about how to measure your room and get the right amount of materials the way this room is laid out I would divide it into three different parts where I would take the measurements and then add those together and with that information you can now pick out the flooring you want you'll also need underlayment and if you're not removing the baseboard you'll also want to pick up quarter-round and to get the right amount and that all you need to do is just measure a baseboard going around the entire room and that'll tell you how much you need and finally you'll need some transition pieces to go from one floor to the next let's assume you have all the materials you need the very next thing you need to do is clean the floor this room previously had carpet and there was a few remaining nails from the texture a pry bar do a really good job of removing those with those removed I can now clean up all the debris on the floor and start off with a clean slate now let's shift our focus over to underlayment and you may have seen that there are a few different versions available at different price underlayment in general is meant to be a moisture barrier and that keeps the 11th floor dry normally you'll see a standard or premium version some of these provided hydrating for sun blocking and the more expensive brands say there are mold and mildew resistant since I'm working with concrete slab here I want to make sure I cover the entire slab with these depending on the brand you get you'll need to pick up a roll of tape to cover the scene this is the standard version and it already comes with its own tape on it so all you have to do is peel and stick the tape is only on one side so once you place the opposite side to the wall you just work your way out from there tape it to the next one and then so on [Music] after working the underlayment in place it's time to move on to the floor so choosing the direction of the floor can stump a lot of people I personally think this boy down to your taste in which you want if you carry this throughout the house then probably make more sense to just carry it right into the bedroom or if you're just doing different Lemony in different rooms you can go with the length of the room or you can go the opposite direction for this installation I'm gonna lay the floor following the longest distance in the room if I was to do this floor again my starting point would be different with the baseboard on it would have been easier to start from the door and work my way to the opposite side so let's head over to the miter saw and I'm gonna cut a few pieces that's gonna be for spacing and these are gonna be for the gap expansion and that means over time the floor is gonna change State due to temperature changes and what you don't want is the floor to buckle because it doesn't have room to expand so I'm gonna place the spacers at the starting point this way I never lose my gap when it comes to the first row I like to spend a little time there trying to prep it and get it all ready to go it's also a good idea to cut off the tongue on the first row of planks the first roll call for three planks two of those are full and one of those I need to cut that and I need to modify the trim going around the closet while it is possible to cut trim without using a oscillating tool if it's possible use an oscillating tool it's just so much easier now I have to cut in the bottom of the trim off you see that the laminate plank can slide right under I now need to cut the profile for the plank so that it can slide onto the trim but before committing today I needed to use tape so I can mark where I wanted to cut because it's really hard to see if I marked on the laminate piece itself the tape also cut down on a chip in from the laminate now that I have this all sorted out I'm gonna make sure I have the proper spacing going around at laminate flooring so let me point out how I like to go about the first three rows of the plank and then it's all repetitive from here on out for the first row I use an entire plane for the second row I went half of that and for the third row only half of the second plank and if you want to carry that consistent look all the way out you could but it may take up more planks by just trying to keep a consistent design if that's not that important to you you can utilize the last cut off plank to start the next row the way these go together is fairly simple you want to take the tongue place it in the groove at an angle and then snap down and this gets pretty repetitive until you make it to the other wall so a quick tip is anytime you're cutting the last plank in that particular row what you want to do is flip it around mark it that way and then make your cut now I like to use a cut off section from the planks and use that as a way to tighten up the joints even if they look tight I tap it a little just to make sure that everything is locked together now I've kept these joints pretty tight going the entire distance across the floor but when you get to the last roll you'll want to use what they call a pull bar to tighten that one up as I said earlier it would have been easier for me to start on this out of the room and the reason for this is the molding did not come off which would have made it easier so now I have to work almost backwards and trying to get it to go under the doorframe and that was a little challenging but keep in mind I do have a little wiggle room here with the quarter round molding which I can hide any gap issues and speaking of quarter round I'm gonna shift my attention to that now normally I'd install the transition and leave the quarter round to the end as I was doing the installation of the floor I realized two different things was happening here the two inches into the room there were different levels one was high and the other one was low my only concern there was I didn't think that the transition piece we had might have worked so I pushed that off to the end and shift my focus over to the quarter round for me to cut down on the back end for I like to cut all the pieces and laid them out before I started and I'm on I cut all the quarter round to a four to five miter which gave the cleanest look I can't think of any rear starting challenge on these so you can pretty much start anywhere and just work your way around a room you can use a nail gun or you can go nail and a hammer now I prefer to use a pin nailer it's not as strong as an 18-gauge nail gun but it leaves the smallest holes in which you can cover while you apply and caulking as you're working on the quarter on you'll find that you need to extend some of these the best way I found to approach these is cutting those out of matter as well these are very easy to cut you can cut those on the miter saw or you can also use a miter box if you really want to finish off the quarter on with a nice touch I'd say matter the ends and cap it off now that I put my undivided attention to two doors it's time to install the transitions when you have two floorings that meet up at the same height you'll want to go with a tea mode transition like this so after a trip to the store and my neighbor informed me that they didn't have any tea moding at the store I do find it to be odd but I didn't want to help the job by not having what I needed so I wanted to see if I could make some modification here at the door and I was able to make it work I druid and install the motor track and they also gave it a bit of a shim so that it's at higher than the tile and also the laminate floor after installing the metal track all I have to do now is hammer the transition piece right into the metal track there is enough tension on the metal piece to hold the transition piece down so these can be pried off if needed even though they have a nice finish on them they're not high quality products so they will come apart if you disturb it too much now I shift my focus over to the bathroom this is a situation I never been in before one I already had an existing transition here in the bathroom and what make this different is the fact that I have to cover a transition with another transition in a way I wish I had a better way to address this but for now this is it a transition please not only provide a decorative solution from one floor to the next but also provide protection to the edge of the laminate I installed a metal truck similar to the one I did at the other entry the only difference is I put the track on top of the laminate flooring for the final touches that tirana trim and also between the baseboard and the quarter round and again this is a perfect opportunity to touch up all the little nail holes there is a bigger than normal gap under this trim I'm not sure if the purpose of that was so that the carpet can go under it or not but I want to fix this by using some caulking and although I'm not fixing it in a sense of taking the issues away I'm gonna mask it by using caulking to make it look more presentable and once I'm done here all my neighbor have to do is paint the baseboard and trim or just do some touch-up work before turning this over to my neighbor all I had to do was clean up my mess and my job was done here you [Music] you", "ZbZRGWQw-5w": "what's up oh geez welcome back and if you're new here welcome so today I'm gonna be doing a stringer view on beyond dream so basically this is going to be my first time doing a strain review and I'm so excited I got some super fireweed I'm gonna be doing a review on the Beyond dream like I said this was gifted to me by NV closetMaid grower probably guys who don't know who he is he's a youtuber who grows and you guys can check out his channel if you want I'll have his link in the description basically he gifted this to me and I'm super excited to do a strain review on this like what being said this is my first time doing a stray interview I'm gonna do my best but basically what I'm gonna try and do with the strain review is test the weed on its taste the smell the looks the high and like the smoothness of it just kind of in general come to a good conclusion of this weed and give you guys my opinion on it but basically right off the bat I can tell you guys the smell is absolutely amazing this is the best weed that I've ever smelled and I am not exaggerating right now I've had some pretty good weed and this is the absolute best weed I have ever smelled the smell that I can tell you on it is like a creamy not creamy it's like a it's like a very berry with like a subtle cream creamy smell to it it's very um it almost smells like a perfume kind of not not a perfume but it's like very sweet and berry and very nice but especially you can get the nice smell of it when you start breaking the bud up I'll tell you that I can still smell it real good here but anyways I'm gonna start breaking up the bud and packing on my bowl and as I'm doing that I'm gonna show you guys some close-ups of this bud and tell you guys what I think about the looks so right off the bat you guys can tell that this weed just from the looks of it is absolutely amazing it has that light green to it which is probably like my favorite like type of Halloween I really like the light green with a lot of frost this weed is just super frosty has light green has a good amount of the orange hairs and just super good nutnut structure it's like not too dense not too fluffy it's just like perfect to me this is a hybrid so it's like right in the middle and it's just an absolutely amazing weave when I break it up like I said the smell comes out the most as I'm breaking up this bowl I can really smell it but though for the looks of it I would give it a ten out of ten the like I said the looks is just absolutely amazing I can't get over how good the weed looks I have really nothing to say that about this weed I'll tell you guys that can't stop smelling it absolutely amazing anyways to start it off I'm gonna try and get a nice taste test I got some loaded up here in the snake pipe I'm gonna also load some hair into the mini long because I do like to get a good taste from my weed from the mini bong I feel like my mini bong gives me a pretty good taste but as I said I'm gonna be smoking these two to kind of determine the taste and then smoke out at the daily driver war to take some nice fat rips to get nice and stone so I can judge the high and then also for all you guys who've been following along you guys have noticed this is new glass gonna be taking some super fabric side of this also because this is about big bong I'm gonna be able to take some fabric side of that have a glass review coming with this bomb coming out soon as well without a lot of stuff coming up on the channel here got a good amount in there just breaking it up and the smell is just absolutely amazing I'm telling you guys this is some amazing flower but I hope you guys are smoked along with me getting your joints Ligon your bulls lick or whatever you guys are smoking on I'm gonna take a nice rip here try and get some taste of this so Cheers oh my gosh right off the bat when house just overflows with the taste of berries and cream that's how I can tell you guys the best way to describe it creamy berries actually I was talking to enemy closet medgar about it and he said that he has like the same exact ER he gets the same exact taste from it as well and he described it it's almost like a strawberry yogurt and I can completely agree with that it has that creamy taste to it and it's really smooth and it has just that hairy taste so that together is almost like just like a berry yogurt strawberry type taste so that's the taste on it I'm gonna take another few rips out of the pipe take a hit out of the made long and then we're gonna take some fat roots out of the out of the big bones and get nice and stoned but Cheers best-tasting wheat I have ever had the best thing I can tell you guys about this week obviously the looks is super amazing and the high and everything is super good I've already been stoned off this so I can tell you guys the high is amazing but the taste is my favorite thing which kind of goes along with the might smell and everything but the taste and smell of this weed is just absolutely amazing it just grabs your tongue and just destroys it with the taste of berries and cream if that he can make sense but this weed is just flavorful weed you know this is definitely some weed that if you want to taste smoke this weed to some tasty way to go Cheers mmm can taste it even more in here take another rib absolutely amazing on the taste 10 out of 10 on the taste 10 out of 10 on the looks this is just 10 out of 10 we guys this actually won the this actual cut I forgot to say this but this exaction can't even talk this strain beyond dream by north genetics grown by MV closet med grower won best hybrid at the Las Vegas Hempfest so first place best hybrid that shows you guys this this flowers no joke I'm telling you guys absolutely amazing I'm going to go ahead and grind stuff and load up some fab Bulls into the roar and then the end line oh my gosh this smell this wheat is almost too good to get too good to smoke like that sounds crazy but do you ever get some really good weed that you just want to keep smelling you can't stop looking at and it's almost just too good to smoke you don't want to smoke it because it's too pretty that's this weed right here absolutely amazing bunch of little pieces of shade flying around oh my gosh the smell is just overwhelming get a load a nice fat rip here I'm pretty I'm pretty I wouldn't say I'm like stoned or anything but I'm feeling pretty high I'll tell you guys after these rips I'm gonna feel absolutely baked you guys can see this is a very light color weed I really like the light greens like I said looks so nice fat repetitive roar gonna judge the hi guys cheers insane on the taste still even getting a bunch of smoke and ripping a big bong man we'll get the taste but I can tell you guys the highest definitely starting to get pretty stoned here guys gonna go ahead and load up the other Bowl for the end line so I can take another fat rip here really judge the high get really stoned here as of right now I can tell you guys it's just a really nice clean high sometimes like I know there's people out there that spoken to cousin sativas and they say that they can like tell the difference and stuff like that I mean I can like subtle I can like have like have ly I have subtle differences that I can tell like it's not like I can smoke something and be able to be like Oh indica sativa obviously if I'm smoking something that is a like like strong indica or something like that and I smoked it in the morning it's not like I'm gonna fall back asleep or anything I'm still gonna get really high so it's kind of hard to judge the high on like body high head high it's kind of like a subtle difference and it kind of you kind of feel it over the time like if you're smoking an indica you'll maybe start getting the couch lock feeling in 30 minutes or so or after the high wears off you'll feel tired as if with the sativa you'll probably feel a little bit more energetic that's just my take on it so as of right now I can say I just feel really stoned I can't stay here and tell you oh I have more of a head higher than a body high I just feel really stoned right now it's just a really clean hi you guys taken what smoking out of the bowl smoking out of the mini ball took a fat rip and I'm just baked you guys it doesn't take a lot to get bags from this so beyond dream my noise genetics guys you guys can just see from the bag it's fire I'm gonna stand up for this one got to stand up when I hit this bond but cheers guys fat rip side of the bonging making it off but holy crap guys so the high I'm gonna tell you guys 10 out of 10 on the high 10 out of 10 on the looks 10 out of 10 on the smell and you guys that might sound like a little bit of an exaggeration but comparing this to the weed I normally smoke easily 10 out of 10 so as far as smoothness it's a really smooth strain but when you're taking really fat rip song like out of a bong like this or like this you know you're gonna pretty much coffee lot regardless of course if this was like if I was smoking some funky weed and I took a huge rip like that I would call a more probably throw up because I'd be coughing my lungs out will happen and that's nasty taste the weed in my mouth but I'm telling you guys this weed is super smooth has great taste it has like a creamy berry taste like I said the smell of it kind of goes hand-in-hand with the taste that has that sweet very creamy smell to it you can't really like smell the bear or the creamy it creaminess to it too much in the smell it's like subtly there it's definitely there with the with the taste hundred-percent this is some top-shelf weed you guys so anyways I think that's pretty much it for the Strand review I hope I covered everything I'm definitely judging the high a 10 out of 10 I feel stoned like I said the looks the smell taste the taste is my favorite thing about this sweep if I could have had to go down to one thing it would be the test this is some weed that you can definitely taste but anyways guys I think I'm gonna end the video here hope you guys enjoyed the video and if you guys enjoyed it maybe go check out some of the other videos oh gee oh peace", "O8OKhEswj1g": "hey guys and welcome to the fish room I'm Rachael O'Leary and it's time for a species spotlight originally I thought I would talk to you guys about the blue really shrimp or blue dream shrimp or Blue Diamond shrimp but the more I thought about it the more confusing I thought that would be because there are easily ten different blue Neo Kara Dyna shrimp on the market so what I've done is gathered together the various Neo Kara Dyna species that I'm working with to explain to you a few key things about these names about the care of the shrimp and give you my opinion on what colors can mix can't mix etc so as you guys remember from my cherry shrimp video they've been around for a very long time since about 2003 and they originate from a wild Taiwanese shrimp that were lying bred to get that bright red coloration and they're classified as Neo caridina David I there's another species of neo Kara Dyna the only other one that I know of that's currently classified called neo Carradine appel Mata now kalamata are typically the ones that you see in the hobby although infrequently at this point as blue pearls or snow bowls or white diamonds things like that and those two are technically different species the cherries and the snowballs for instance so if you were to mix those two technically you're creating a hybrid a hybrid is when you mix two beans that are different species to create offspring now the tricky part with dwarf shrimp is that because there's only two main classifications and they've been lying bred so dramatically to create the sort of rainbow of colors mixing colors is not always technically hybrid it's simply line breeding and selective breeding and working with genetics that are pretty much poorly understood to create a desired color form and you do that by breeding the shrimp then picking out any undesirable shrimp and either calling them or putting them in another tank separate from your breeding colony and then picking your best expression female and a couple best expression males and breeding them again and repeat repeat rinse repeat rinse until you get a line that is consistently throwing the same color form now since cherry shrimp which are these guys have been the ones that have been around along is they're the ones that have been worked with the most and that's where your yellows come from your oranges chocolates carbons most of your blues almost all of your Raley's but the wild forms the PAL Mata have also been worked with and they have a lot of the similar color expressions so it gets really tricky and it really comes down to the importer the exporter to know what they're getting so that you have a clue what you're putting in your tank unfortunately it's not that easy a lot of the line breeding takes you know five to 10 years to really isolate out a very good line bred color form so depending on the breeder they give it a different name and this is where a lot of the confusion comes in Taiwanese breeders will call them one thing German breeders will call them another none of us are really clear on what exact species we're working with or what exactly has gone into creating that species so you end up with shrimp with a ton of different names so what I'm going to do is show you ones that are readily available in the American hobby tell you what the most common names for those are and go over a little bit about their husbandry so let's take a look I think most people at this point are relatively familiar with cherry shrimp I've been keeping them since 2003 when they first hit the American market and because they've been around for so long I considered the best beginner shrimp their genetics are very stable and they're available in the hobby for a relatively affordable price you can find out anywhere from $1 to $5 depending on grade now by grade I mean some of these shrimp have been line bred cold as I mentioned in order to increase the opacity of the red not just in the body but also the legs of the ant and the antennae and that's where the grades of Sakura are painted fire red or Bloody Mary etc come from the higher the degree of the opacity of the red on the legs antenna and the body the better the grade of the shrimp that doesn't mean that you can't start out with a lesser quality and call it yourself to get that degree now around the same time that cherries were introduced or a few years later the wild types were introduced these are neo caridina pal Mata you can see there's quite a bit of variability with a bunch of settling some lines some dots but all in all they have a relatively transparent carapace or body and their color is not as striking as those that have been line bred now these are a completely different species from your cherry these are being lined bred to produce yellows to produce various realese and sometimes are even mixed or hybridized with the cherry to create new color forms often you'll hear about when you mix dwarf shrimp that you'll end up with a wild type variation and this is the kind of colors that they're talking about and that doesn't happen overnight if you mix color forms initially you'll get quite a few nice-looking shrimp but if you don't call and you don't remove offspring of lesser quality over time you'll end up with a lot of these shortly after cherry shrimp the time Anees breeders started line breeding to remove sections of opacity to produce a neo Kara Dyna Shran that resembled more of a crystal read but had the durability and hardiness of a neo caridina taking that wide range of parameters from six to eight temperatures from the 60s to the 80s and a wide range of hardnesses and these were labeled really shrimp and what that is is when there's patches of color and transparency I seen him in these red rallies now after a while quite a few of us started noticing that we would get blue bodies to these red Raley's and eventually the red parts would turn blue as the shrimp matured and that's where the first blue Neos came from they're a derivative of these they're a derivative of these red Riklis and those are the ones that you often saw call blue dreams blue diamonds blue Velvets when this first started happening in the hobby I was like what the heck we just spent years getting all these shrimp nice and dark and now we're breeding clear patches and it seemed kind of counterintuitive but they are definitely lovely there are a couple David IgE wild types that are available in the hobby one of which is chocolate and when you mix chocolate shrimp these guys here with a good quality cherry red or a painted fire red you get the Blue Diamond shrimp which have that a lot more opacity to their carapace the blue is a darker color blue as opposed to a frosty color blue now chocolates are often wine bred on their own right because they're really quite lovely when you reinforce them like this big female in the foreground but when mixed with cherries they can create a blue body shrimp that's really dark almost like a midnight blue and they're really lovely and again this is a technically hybridization because they're the same species then we have carbons now carvings were one of the first really so you can see there's a great there's a bunch of variability and these have more of a natural blue at color and these are where your blue dreams came from isolating and line braiding breeding these guys so that black turns more of a blue black made for some really beautiful blue shrimp again it's just a result of line breeding and here's an example of some of the blues I'm working with now these Express a lot of really genetics here are the blues I'm working with most likely which are derived from a carbon and I only say that because you can see the degree of the black blue to the the non or to the really portion of the shrimp and these are very good examples of really shrimp with a very dark tail in head portion and the transparency to the body now these shrimp also throw solid blues so I tend to isolate them out based on their characteristics this is a really tank where I'm trying to strengthen that dark blue and maintain that center clear portion to the body you can see that they're a really dark deep blue which happens to be my preference really really lovely shrimp another one of the original color forms available in the Hobby where yellows and there's a wide range of variability and the color available with these guys some of them get a really dark deep golden color with a broad stripe down their back and some are like these that are simply a lovely lemon color the whole way throughout another variant is what are commonly called pumpkin shrimp or the orange shrimp there's a fair amount of variability with them as well and keep in mind almost all of these color forms are being produced in that real the clear or transparent is more accurate patch in the middle of their body now all of these shrimp are relatively easy they all thrive in a tank that has a pH anywhere in the 7s middle-of-the-road GH in KH and a temperature ranging from 64 to 82 with mid 70s being ideal when I set them up in a tank I like to add some plants and some dark substrate neo Kara diamonds in particular seem to exhibit the best coloration when they're on a dark substrate I prefer to keep all my color variations separate I prefer to call out the lesser specimens I like to call out all the lesser specimens so that I can maintain a level of quality within the various types I work with there's nothing wrong with line breeding but until there's a better understanding of the genetics keep in mind if you mix color forms what you're going to and end up with eventually unless you put in a lot of hard work our shrimp that look like these now all the Neo caridina are what we call high order breeders which means they give birth to miniature versions of the parents they carry about 30 eggs which hatch after about three weeks and they're exceptionally tiny you can see on this female in the plant how little those eggs are so each baby shrimp is like the size of the dash mark on a keyboard and this means that for best results if you want to breed trim you should not keep them with any fish the babies are just too small that isn't to say that they can't be mixed with shrimp you just need to identify your goals your goal is to breed shrimp keep them in a species tank I trust me they're active engaging fun exciting creatures to keep and they don't take up a lot of space so I do think that a larger dilution makes your life a lot easier my smallest size range that I like to work with shrimpin is a 10 gallon with 20 long being more ideal not because of their bio load simply because of keeping the tank parameters stable these guys have a negligible bio but they are completely intolerant to fluctuations of parameters that means a well cycled tank is an absolute must hope that helps are you guys lost yet I hope not thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe so

crossovers from the very small venue all the way up to this three-row palisade and now going into only its second model year hyundai is already making a lot of changes like adding more standard equipment to all the trim levels revising some of the styling elements and even introducing a high-end calligraphy model to the lineup for the first time now this was already considered one of the best three rows on the market but did these 2021 updates now make it number one let's go ahead and find out [Music] so it's very uncommon for a manufacturer to make changes on just the second model year after a full redesign but hyundai actually has and you'll notice that right up here in the front now what we've got is the limited trim but you'll notice that the grille doesn't look like last year you no longer have the bars across the front and that's because that's now been eliminated the limited trim has a the same fascia as the se and the se l trim level this year with the kind of chrome mesh now that new calligraphy model that actually has its own unique grille design which features little chrome triangles but kind of looks similar to this setup now along the bottom on the limited model you will find a silver accent and the calligraphy model has a big accent that grows all the way across now over here at the headlights this is one of our most important 2021 changes and that's that the full led headlights are now standard across all of the trim levels so previously the se and the sel had halogen lights and now you have the advanced setup however you're still not going to find fog lights on any of the trim levels and continuing our design updates here at the wheels you'll notice we have a new design for the limited trim this was previously part of the sel premium package it is a 20 inch contrast alloy design if you go for the calligraphy model that also has a 20 inch alloy but with a really wild design that's really attention grabbing finally on the lower trim levels those both have 18 inch alloys and jumping up here to your mirrors they have a really unique design with this kind of circled led turn signal this is on the majority of the trim levels as well as blind spot monitoring being on all but the base model and then all the trim levels have heating all right so let's go ahead and check out the palisades rear design now back here in the rear you're not going to see as many changes as you do in the front but there are a few different calligraphy exclusive touches but starting out with the tail lights these are going to be the full led setup this is the premium setup that's on the top trims and you do also have this nice little silver accent here to kind of give it a unique look in addition to that we have palisades spelled out across the back and then we also have this silver diffuser area and it is worth noting that if you go for that calligraphy model that's going to have a unique diffuser design and all of the models are going to have the dual exhaust on the right side now hyundai has really brought their a-game to the table when it comes to the safety systems because you're going to have absolutely all of them standard even on the very base model that's going to include even your most advanced safety systems like adaptive cruise control lane keeping assist and auto high beam headlamps but that's going to conclude the exterior for this 2021 hyundai palisade and let's go ahead and check out the inside that's really quite luxurious on this limited model and before we do that be sure that subscribe button down below now walking up to the palisade hyundai was nice enough to include their smart entry system as well as remote start on all but the very base model [Music] and then to get inside the vehicle itself there's not going to be a sensor behind the handle so you just press the button to unlock [Music] now taking a peek inside of this cabin this is one of the things that really makes the palisades stand apart because it has such an upscale design for this price tag now as far as your different color and material options you do have quite a number of choices and you have even more this year so for your sc and your sel that's going to come standard with cloth seating and your choice of black or gray sel with the premium package upgrades you to real leather in black gray or light beige now when you get up to this limited trim or the calligraphy that's where you will get the real napa leather which of course is a very premium grade of leather and that comes in black beige or for the calligraphy only a special dark brown now turning over here to your door trim you're going to see those same nice materials reflected up here so you have leather across all this as well as above it but i will point out one update for 2021 and that's that the limited trim now loses the quilting on the door trim you will have to go for the calligraphy if you want that this year above that we have some black trim and the top is going to be soft touch on the limited and above you'll find two-person memory seating and all four of your windows are one touch automatic as far as your seats the vast majority of models are going to come with an 8-way power adjusting seat however if you choose the limited or the calligraphy you'll get four-way lumbar support as well as the power thigh extension and then like i was already saying the these seats are made of fine nap leather and they are absolutely lovely you have the quilting detail up here at the top for a really upscale look the leather quality is superb and you even have the color contrast piping around the outside so this is definitely a seat that is worthy of a luxury vehicle now the great materials extend far beyond the seats and it is definitely safe to say this palisade has one of the nicest cabins in the entire class so across your upper dash you're going to find a soft touch plastic driving down here to the middle we have a black trim on this model you can get a faux wood trim if you choose the lighter colored model and then down below we have another trim that runs through the middle we also have more leather that runs along through here with a stitching detail where your knees would rest against all this is finished in a faux aluminum and of course everything in here fits together absolutely wonderfully now start up the palisade all but the base model will have standard push button start [Music] so once it fires up one of the first things you're going to notice is this premium 12.3 inch full reconfigurable gauge cluster setup now this is standard on limited and calligraphy models they're actually two different setups on the lower end models with a small display and then a seven inch display but this right here is the most premium setup and i've said it before and i'll say it again this is one of the best reconfigurable gauge clusters i've seen especially in a mainstream vehicle so you can cycle through a lot of different information here or you can also cycle to this side and change information over here as well now it does have some additional tricks so if you have the limited or the calligraphy model you have the blind camera system so when you signal one direction or the other it puts a camera view of your blind spot which is definitely very helpful and in addition to that the limited and calligraphy also throw in a head up display now coming back to the steering wheel of course you have electric power assisted steering you will find a nice leather-wrapped steering wheel on the sel and above if you choose that new calligraphy model you have a special perforated leather and it will be heated on both the limited and the calligraphy now as far as the wheel itself it is going to be manual tilt and telescoping across the entire lineup all right so now let's go ahead and talk about interior storage which is one of this palisades most impressive characteristics so starting out under our center console here we have a little tray we can't remove that and as you can see inside we have a ton of space this is a very deep console you also have a usb and a 12-volt outlet inside and as you can probably tell it's going to be able to take these coupons absolutely no problems whatsoever now what's impressive about the palestine is that the storage is only just beginning so if you press this button and slide this back you have another really large storage area right here you press those buttons and it releases your cup holders you also have a wireless phone charging pad right there which is available on the sel and standard on the limited and above plus another usb port now furthermore we have a floating center console so you actually have a ton of space down here where you can stick uh you know something extra like a purse or some groceries and you have another 12-volt outlet and another usb port so you definitely have an impressive amount of space that's a lot bigger than most the competition including the telluride now one of the ways that hyundai went about making this much space is because they went with a small electronic shifter so this is pretty self-explanatory for drive you're just going to press the d you will find paddle shifters on board as well and then for reverse you just press the r at the top now once you press that you're going to see a standard backup camera of course but you'll also find a surround view monitor system if you go for the limited model or the calligraphy does have active trajectory your 360 view and then you can switch your views over here on the side i also want to mention that parking sensors are standard which is kind of surprising for this class of vehicle and then when you're in reverse your mirrors do tilt down to help you see the parking lines better and you also have an electronic parking brake as well as a brake hold function now right beside that you'll notice all the controls for our seat climate uh heated seats are actually going to be standard on all but the very base model which is a nice touch and then the limited model and above will have seat ventilation as well and then in regard to the actual climate controls themselves we have a three zone automatic climate control setup this is going to be standard on all but the base model and as you can see adjustment is super simple you just have these knobs right here as well as physical controls for everything else and then directly above that we also have our audio controls now on board for this upper end model here we have the 630 watt 12 speaker harman kardon sound system it is standard on both the limited and the calligraphy model so let's go ahead and take a sample [Music] overall sound quality of this system is excellent definitely one of the best i've heard in this class vehicle plus we have real metal speaker grilles which look extremely classy especially for a mainstream vehicle all right so now we are up here at our main display so what you're looking at is the 10.25 inch display that is standard on the limited and the calligraphy model you can get it on the sdl as well if you want and then the standard model comes with an 8-inch display instead now there are some changes this year to the blue link system one of the important changes is that wireless android auto and wireless apple carplay are now available however it's only available with the basic eight inch display you actually cannot get it with this larger 10.25 inch display however when you have the larger 10.25 inch display you still have wired android auto and wired apple carplay plus you have the integrated map display here from hyundai and also on the limited trim that's where you will get the passenger talk system which is basically an intercom that delivers your voice to the back seat so they can hear you clearly [Music] now moving on up from that we have an auto dimming mirror with three helmet universal remotes on the limited trim up along the top you will notice a moon roof uh the standard size moon roof that's available on the sel however on this model right here we've got the dual panels panoramic setup so as you can see you have a large panel on the back second and third row as well as an opening smaller moon roof up here in the front now while we're up here i do want to point out one of the 2021 changes you'll notice that the suede headliner has been eliminated from the limited this year you now have a different design which looks very similar to what you'll find in the santa fe still nice and premium if you want the suede headliner though you'll now have to get the calligraphy model now sitting in the palisade second row just closing your eyes and leaning back you might just think you're in a luxury three row because this is an extremely nice rear seat just like the tell your ride fully loaded model is now as far as your space that's going to be the first thing to mention you're going to come in at 42.4 inches of your leg room and 40 inches of rear headroom which just place it above main rivals like the honda pilot and toyota highlander and of course right on par with that kia telluride now as far as behind your seating position i have around seven to eight inches of your leg room my feet can easily set up underneath the seat and it is also worth noting that the seat can also slide forward and back as well as recline now as far as your feature set there is going to be a lot this is the almost fully loaded limited trim so here in the center we are going to have climate controls the climate controls are going to be standard in the sel trims and higher off to the side we do have heated rear seats as well as three stage ventilated rear seats and it is worth knowing those ventilated rear seats come on the limited and calligraphy model dropping down we have a household style outlet a 12 volt outlet and hyundai has not forgotten about the usb ports because you do have two in the back of each seat back up top we have our vents and then as far as the seating itself is concerned captains chairs are going to be standard on the scl trims and higher and it is not an option to add the bench seating on the limited or calligraphy and then off to the side we have rear window sunshades also on the limited and calligraphy model now this palisade is a three row so let's check out that third row now hyundai has made it very easy all you have to do is locate this little button right here push it and it does fold the seat as well slide it right out of the way so definitely a very convenient way to get into the third row and let's go ahead and get back here so sitting in the palisades third row this is a pretty impressive aspect of it because you're going to have 31 inches of your leg room and 38 inches of your headroom which just place it at the top end of the class it's definitely going to be better than something like a toy to highlander a honda pilot and you know as far as like the thigh support it's not fantastic but it also isn't too bad like i really wouldn't have too much of a problem traveling on a long road trip in this third row and as you can see this seat is slid all the way back and i still have about an inch or two of rear leg room so definitely very impressive now as far as the features the limited model is going to throw in quite a few so we have vents up top as well as a power recline function so this is something that the telluride does not offer and it's also very rare just to have a power reclining third row i also want to point out that we do have the diamond quilted design back here which is something i think is pretty impressive as well as charging usb ports on the side now walking up to the tailgate you're going to notice that this palisade limited does have the hands-free smart trunk and that's going to be standard on the limited and calligraphy models now as far as the space you're going to get when you get inside of this cargo area you're going to find 18 cubic feet behind the third row seats that expands to 46 cubic feet if you fold them and then as a maximum you have 86 cubic feet of cargo capacity that does place it above both the highlander and pilot however it is slightly below the kia telluride and as far as how they finished it very impressive we have a nice carpeting along the floor if we lift it up we have a cargo cover as well as quite a bit of under floor storage here you could definitely throw a lot of stuff up there then off to the side you're going to find a 12-volt outlet as well as one of the palisades coolest features and that said it includes a power folding third row which is something that really is extremely rare in the segment of vehicle and something that the kia telluride does not have so it's definitely nice that hyundai has run that in and that is going to be on the limited and calligraphy models now as far as your passengers see it is going to be power adjusting of course on this limited trim and then in front of the passenger we do have a really good size glove box this is a quite large glove box so it's going to fit our coupons in here no problem so no matter how many coupons you have they're gonna fit that's definitely good for a three row and then up top we do have a large sun visor with a mirror led light and it does also detach as well as extend [Music] just like that we are up to 60 going up a pretty steep incline so plenty of power on board with this palisade it's got the 3.8 liter naturally aspirated v6 engine 291 horsepower 262 pound-feet of torque so you're looking at class competitive numbers roughly actually some of the rivals come with four cylinders at this point so you do have the standard v6 on board and i think it's definitely going to be more than enough for the average consumer like you said up that hill that acceleration definitely satisfactory for this segment if not better than most but wow just we're cruising right now at 57 miles an hour and you know last year when we tested the palisade i was very impressed with the way it rode on the highway and this year is no different this we're actually in the limited trim so maybe it's even a little bit better than the scl we tested last year but it's really exceptional how smooth this rides and how quiet it is you know going 60 miles an hour i will get a sound level reading so we can compare to some of the rivals but it definitely sounds very quiet in here getting ready to go over bridge here as well yeah we're looking at 55 decibels and we're going a solid 60 miles an hour and the highlander tested at around 54 so one less but we definitely weren't going 60. um so i definitely think that this is on par if not better than the average thing in the segment for as far as the noise level and the comfort is also just there yeah the ride on this is really excellent super soft i actually think that it feels maybe a little bit softer than the tell you ride you know that that one has like maybe a little bit sportier on the suspension tuning and this one's a little bit softer and more comfort oriented so that's a little bit of a difference you could keep in mind if you're cross shopping the two of them but like you said in the class you know this is very comfort oriented definitely compares well with the platinum version of the highlander so we just had our auto start stop system engaged uh really smooth that was a that was an excellent takeoff from the uh being turned off uh really nice any vibrations at all if i hadn't have seen it visually over there i definitely wouldn't have noticed but i do always like to point out for people since some people just genuinely do not like it you can defeat it the button's right there as far as your handling is concerned even though this is a really really large vehicle it really feels surprisingly agile it has that characteristic just like the telluride it made a similar comment you know they're very large but they feel smaller than the competition just in the way that the handling or the chassis and the steering are tuned it just gives it a more tossable more agile feel which minimizes the size and heft of everything so on board we've got an eight speed automatic transmission so that is across all the entire range definitely operates nice and smoothly plenty fast shifts it's also very responsive when you put your foot down ready to rock and roll and it is also worth noting as far as the drive trains front wheel drive is standard and you do have optional all-wheel drive so this is pretty ironic but we're actually pulling up right beside a 2020 limited palisade and that actually is today's air ball you say why is that that's because as we talked about on the outside there's been some styling revisions for the limited trim level this year and we're not sure they're for the better and as far as today's slam dunk now there is a lot more to like than dislike with this palisade of course because this is a really solid offering in the segment um we're going to say value this is probably not going to come as a surprise to a lot of you guys because hyundai's hyundai's have a lot of value in all of their lineup and this is no different this one as equipped really just has more equipment than the competition it's also cheaper than the competition and it's worth noting that when you compare it to a tell your ride even though that does have a lot of value a lot of tell you rides have markup and this palisade is not going to have that it has more availability so you will be able to go to your hyundai dealer and just grab one of these as opposed to a telluride where you might have to wait or pay a buff sticker alrighty and like we mentioned at the beginning there is only one engine for this palisade so you're only going to have front wheel drive and all wheel drive for your fuel economies the front wheel drive is going to come in at 19 city 26 highway 22 combined and the all wheel drive drops that down one mpg and since we were speaking about value just a second ago let's go ahead and mention the prices for this palisade lineup now keep in mind this is with front wheel drive so the sc is 32 525 sel 35 175 limited 45 125 and then now you have the calligraphy uh that is all wheel drive only and that's going to be 47 750. now as far as how this one is equipped we have the limited front-wheel drive and then when you add the destination charge of eleven forty uh this one's grand total is going to come in at a pretty reasonable forty seven thousand five hundred and twenty bucks so at the beginning of the video i asked is this palisade the best three row crossover you can buy and i have to say after spending the day with it it really is one of the best for sure you know is it the best it's very difficult to say because there's a lot of really awesome competition in the segment but i think any way you look at it you are doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't at least come out to your hyundai dealership and check one of these things out because this has so much

this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway

roses are the rarest flower in the Animal Crossing universe and with good reason the methods used to obtain them are tedious to say the least but I hope to make it even a little more simple to obtain them to begin you'll need a couple of normal roses it's important that these themselves are not hybrid roses just to make things more simple I find it easiest to purchase them from Leafs garden shop or to pick them up from the island you'll need two white roses one red rose and one yellow rose find a clear spot somewhere around your town we'll have room to breed your roses I find the beach is the best place and yes believe it or not you can grow flowers on your beach next place down the 2 white roses next to each other and water them now place down the remaining red and yellow rose and water them make sure to keep the two pairs separate for easier breeding it may not happen the immediate next day but you should eventually find two new hybrid roses have been bred the two whites will breed a purple and the red and yellow will breed an orange there's a chance they may breed different colors also but you need the hybrid purple and orange once you've got your hybrid purple and orange you need to breed them together I suggest finding another clear spot to do this in the goal here is to breed them together to get a flower called the hybrid red rose it looks completely identical to other red roses but it is the only roses capable of breeding a blue rose be careful not to get this hybrid mixed up with normal red roses this is the final and probably the most frustrating step in getting the blue rose you need to breed two hybrid red roses together this can take a very long time with a lot of normal red and black roses bred in the mean time do not expect this to be quick that all being said I have a few little tips that could help make this process just a little bit easier firstly invest in fertilizer leaf will tell you when purchasing it then it will help make breeding hybrids easier simply bring it close to the flowers you're trying to breed and let it work its magic second planting a Jacob's Ladder flower mix the flowers you're trying to breed can help increase your chances of producing a hybrid Jacobs ladders are only obtained for having the perfect town and cannot be bred together so if you have them I definitely recommend using them to your advantage after all this effort and with a little luck your hybrid red roses should produce a blue rose congratulations if you've made at this point now all you need to do is produce another blue rose and you'll be able to breed them together to get as many of them as you want as always guys if this video helped you then why not like comment or subscribe and while you're at it why not check out some of my other Animal Crossing new leaf videos this has been simply press start where gaming's as simple as pressing start you", "xWDAICZj5sI": "what's going on everybody is hyper hovering I wanted to give you a small demonstration and tutorial of aromatized and flavouring your cannabis flowers you guys know products like floor nectar okay which they have I want to say general hydroponics has a about seven different flavors of floor nectar pineapple - raw cane sugar - blueberry amongst others bud candy obviously that's another popular one from advanced nutrients I bought this bottle thinking I was going to use it for this grow but it never did you know for the purpose of the channel you know people asked me to use things and then I buy them I don't necessarily use them and they just sit here so but what I have used and pretty extensively and heavily is raw cane sugar molasses and flavoring extracts that that you can get at the baking store so let me put you in on this you can see what it looks like you know it's a Loran gourmet candy and baking flavoring so basically that's it and it's super concentrated four times stronger than any other basic extracts that she'll get it's just the common grocery store so I've cracked open blueberry you can see that this one is empty and I did use a blueberry on that blue dream so that frickin Blue Dream after that last video that we took I did use blueberry one drama blueberry per 10 gallons of reservoir water and boy oh boy can I tell you that plan is putting off like blueberry like no tomorrow now I want to I do want to note that if you're looking to cover up a shitty strain you know or a bad aroma to a strain this ain't gonna do it this is only gonna add flavoring to that current kademan and cannabis the Canopus profile so you got oh gee coach and you got a really heavy OG Kush and it smells like pine-sol pine trees it's gonna smell like blueberry pine-sol pine trees so it doesn't cover up you know your your strange genetics you know it's genetical aroma it just adds flavoring to that and it's funny I was out in the crowd the other day hanging out with the boys and somebody just you know I didn't know broken up broke open a little bit of a little bit of weed and it came my way and once I once it got to me I was like damn I knew exactly where it came from you know how that was uh basically how that was manufactured you know so to speak so I knew that the grower that grew that bubblegum strain which I'm pretty sure was bubblegum but it was the most intense bubblegum that I've ever Roma that I've ever seen in my life it was pretty freakin strong he probably used a couple or a few of these drums purple you know / that / that a ratio of 10 gallons that's how intense that thing was either that he used it throughout you know mid bloom all the way to the end and it got the bubblegum was really really intense so you know for a lot of people that don't grow or that's just they're not into the scene of growing and I haven't been growing that long this is a kind of information that is valuable and this is also the kind of information that no experienced grower is gonna typically share on an everyday basis with people out there that don't know how to grow and that's why I'm sharing it with you guys so you guys can have fun with it because it is fun to do so so like I said pineapple and if you look at the back of these they they basically hit a new ball cut up 100 flavors for candy when I tell you they got 100 flavors they got hump 100 plate but is they got caught candy bubblegum blueberry amaretto toffee dark chocolate any pretty much anything you want to compliment anything that you were mind can conjure up and be creative with they have a flavor for that they even have eggnog last last Christmas I seen I seen a little bit of eggnog eggnog weed floating around it was called the Christmas you know Christmas buzz this ha was like I was laughing because I I knew how it was how it was done I know how that effect was accomplished but most everybody else was like yeah man this is eggnog strain it's the best and then to say okay it tastes good but doesn't mean it's best rain so if you guys are looking to enhance the the aromas from your cannabis and complement them with with items like these products like these you can totally do so and the reason why and I'm telling you guys this is because you a lot of people already do it with products like these this bottle costs $21 pineapple if you wanted to and look at the back it's made of cane sugar malt extract and molasses which is all sugars and pineapple of course so cane sugar raw cane sugar molasses added drama pineapple and you have the effect of this times 100 okay this this [ __ ] right here is diluted like it's just like piss water compared to how strong this stuff is so you guys can make any flavor or any kind of sugar and conjure up any kind of recipe for your weed because you can you know you guys can see what this is okay non-playing food ingredients and its flavoring answers like you like these with sugars added same thing goes with this blood candy and they're not gonna but candy will never tell you that on the back of their [ __ ] but they barely tell you how much calcium is in their products but um obviously cotton candy blood candy you guys wanted in this bottle [ __ ] how much does this bomb $30 and I bought this bottle for that grow in there which I never used so it's gonna stay there for probably definitely can tell so many rows along and I give it away but cotton candy if you want cotton candy these things right here cost about $3 for two pack so you basically a dollar 50 a drum each drum will last you a grow or if you want to be you know vigilant with it and get the most you know you can add it the last two weeks of your plants lifecycle so I have one drum one week when you do your reservoir change add that at the set the second drum on your flushing week it doesn't contain any nitrogen phosphorus or potassium so it's not gonna affect anything to do with your flushing the only thing that this is going to do is aromatize and add a little bit of you know cannabis flavor spirits back in your guys's smoke so you guys can get really creative with it I cracked this blueberry open and I actually used one drama blueberry here in that blue drain plant and that and that was the last video after I made that last video I actually spontaneously spontaneously went down and got these I had to drive clear across town to get them and I added one drama and now that that blue drain smells like blue dream blueberries it's exactly what it smells like there's no hiding hiding your genetics strain you know it's floor it's floral profile if it smells like you know OG Kush which is a really good OG Kush typically is smells like you know mr. clean pine Saul you know freakin pine trees is exactly what it smells like so if you add blueberry to that you're gonna get pie you know pine-sol blueberry is what its gonna smell like so you're gonna want to choose a flavor that kind of complements your your your gin net your strains profile already so choose something that goes with you guys as uh you guys is a strain in complement they complement each other that's why I chose blueberry for the Blue Dream they complement very very his smells like a I want to say the Blue Dream is like so stevis it smells like a sour sour hazy sour Diesel's kind of with that one smells like in there very it's clean linen Sour Diesel Hayes's what it smells like so adding the blueberry to that just and just intensified all those aromas they kind of brought it out more and to your palate when you're smoking it definitely when you're just standing in there smelling it it brings it all to your taste buds and it also adds a little bit of blueberry with it it doesn't hide anything so if you guys anybody out there thinking they're gonna go get this stuff and are gonna cover up some shitty ass genetics you know a Roma's that smells like grass it's not gonna do it there's something I'm gonna do it it's gonna smell like grassy cotton candy so just a little tip you guys can have fun with this and anything you can dream up they have like like I said the most the I would say the most outright freaking awkward one that I've ever seen is the eggnog and there's no eggnog for straying guys you know I mean so you know I knew exactly how that was how that was done so I used to use this back in the day and it worked really good I used to do it all the time and I just haven't done it in a long time but I did make that last video for you guys with with this stuff here you can use stuff like this from your just common grocery store but you're gonna have to use a lot of it and it doesn't have quite the the intensified effect as just your straight-up 100% pure concentrate you know candy sweetening and this is what they used to bake with I was just looking at the back of this and it says it's made in Lansing Michigan so this is probably right in your guys's backyard boys you know you guys could probably pick this up at the this you know stop and shop or something like that I don't know your grocery or your gas station probably carries this so I don't know but um have fun with it be creative you know I just that's it you know this is a something I want to share with you because I I don't ever hear anybody talk about this unless experienced growers are sitting around talking then and there's like and they're really in depth with conversation then this kind of this methods get brought up so I just wanted to share this with you guys so you guys can have more fun out there in your guys's rooms and enjoy your guys are straight s'more if you guys wish to flavor them up with products like this and basically adding these things is the same thing as adding any of these products cotton candy or this but only these products here have sugars as well so like I said you can ideas just add these with sugars and you get the same effect how your hybrid y'all keep it easy man I am [ __ ] dirt rag tired right now I'm going bad so I hope you guys enjoyed this video it gives somebody out there some inspiration to do some cool things peace out bubblegum cotton candy all right ma'am later", "LdAYJ2N887s": "[Music] hey what's up techie people hopefully everyone is doing well

guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "xoncEl1AJik": "good morning everybody this is Melvin at Beaver Toyota and we're looking at the 2019 blue flame yes it's called blue flame rav4 hybrid with the black interior just a really pretty color it's here on the showroom and I wanted to share it with you because they're hard to come by and certainly this color is hard to come by also the hybrid technology has come a long way especially with Toyota and other manufacturers but the rav4 is just a wonderful vehicle for you and your family 4-door capabilities with a hatchback and again it's blue flame rav4 right here at Beaver Toyota it has the alloy rims disc brakes hybrid technology which actually has more horsepower more torque than its predecessor just the regular a gas-powered engine and again it's Melvin at Beaver Toyota and I look forward to seeing you thank you", "nSqzp3kdAm4": "The Abu Dhabi circuit is also famed\nfor having a 1.2 kilometre straight, one of the longest anywhere. Seems like a good place to start.\nLet's make some noise. Oh, that is breath-taking! Nine thousand rpm. Boom! Big speed! Two hundred and eighty! Braking... Oh, that is... That is acceleration\nunlike anything else. I know Jeremy's head was blown off\nby the speed of that P1, but I absolutely cannot believe\nit felt any faster than this. It can't have done. Like the McLaren, the 918 has\na joint strike force of petrol engine and electric motors working together. It's that electric power\nthat gives it so much punch off the line. I have 500 foot-pound\nof torque at 800 rpm... 800! The 458 doesn't\nhave 500 torques at any rpm. It just wakes up.\nIt's like a sprinter falling out of bed and going straight into a world record while the others are eating cornflakes\nand thinking about having a poo. The petrol engine, which sounds ungodly\nthrough those top-mounted exhausts... is a 612 horsepower 4.6 litre V8. On the topic of power and performance, the 918 and the P1\ncan trade punches all day long. The 918 can't match the P1's top speed,\n218 compared to 211. But I get to 60 quicker,\n2.6 seconds to his sluggish 2.8. I've got 875 brake horsepower.\nThe P1 has 903, but I've got more torque. And on and on and on it goes.\nIt's King Kong versus Godzilla. There are some areas, though, where the\n918 definitely has the P1 on the ropes. It can retrieve energy\ngenerated by braking and feed it back into the batteries. The roof lifts out so you can enjoy\nsome open-top cruising. And inside,\nyou get some actual creature comforts, like electric seats\nand an 11-speaker sound system. You don't get either of those on a P1. I'm not one to gloat,\nbut hello, glove box, yeah? And then this centre console,\nfrom where I can control the top screen. That does many things up there. And then\nover 800 functions can be controlled from the touch-sensitive screen down here. Maybe I can go online and order Jeremy a set of spanners\nto adjust the seat on his P1. Look up old-fashioned for me. In addition to the wealth\nof on-board amusements, the 918 also has many driving modes. Right now I am in fully electric mode. And I can whisper\naround like this for 18 miles, compared to the P1's seven. But if I go down here,\nI can select hybrid. And that allows it to alternate\nbetween petrol and electric in the most efficient way. Or we've got sport mode,\nwhere we have petrol power all the time. But I'm here on this racetrack,\nso, let's go one further. Put it in race mode. Now the petrol engine is top dog. The electric motors\nare acting as its wingmen. It's time to attack some corners. Hell's bells! That grip! God, this thing corners\nand I mean it... flat! Totally flat. And there is none\nof that bottom-clenching terror Jeremy talked about in the P1. Partly, that is because\nwhere the P1 is rear drive only, the 918 has four-wheel-drive\nand four-wheel steering. I think in essence, yes,\nthe P1 is more a proper fighter pilot, seat-of-the-pants staff.\nThis is altogether more civilised. But that does not mean it's boring,\nbecause it just isn't. The back end crates away\nlike a rear-wheel-drive car. What a thing! But even though\nthe 918 is more grown-up than the P1, it can still boast some pretty\nexciting achievements. The fact is, this car has lapped the\nNurburgring in six minutes 57 seconds. That is faster\nthan any other road-legal production car. To put it into context, a hard-core Lexus LFA did it\nin seven minutes 14 seconds. The mighty Nissan GTR\nwas almost half a minute slower. As for the P1, well, McLaren are saying\nit has gone round in under seven minutes, but they're not saying an actual time. I don't know, maybe they lost\nthe piece of paper it was written on. Or something. With daylight coming, I locked up, left the keys to the circuit under the mat\nand went in search of breakfast. Full of awe for this incredible machine. Here I am with 875bhp,\na 4.6 litre V8 that sounds... like that. And yet the CO2 emissions\nare lower than a Toyota Prius. And certainly, much lower than a P1. I don't know, this is just all round\na more impressive achievement. It's more of its time.\nTo put it another way, McLaren have used hybrid technology\nto liven up a supercar today. Porsche have used hybrid technology\nto save the supercar for tomorrow. This is an important car.", "ynDyYp8z1oM": "what's going on you fam ryuden here so if you saw the uh live stream or you checked out the video i made afterwards on youtube for the summons we got our hands on the ultimate gohan the one with the funny looking starting art but his alternate art is straight fire look at that so we're going to go ahead and do our little showcase on the guy we did get him to five stars which is quite nice here are his stats pre-transformation not bad but post transformation looking spicy so um blue card major impact damage opponent has additional sub count which is great i think his green card free transformation is pretty good but post transformation is where it becomes super spicy look at that it basically becomes super baby 2's green card but much better chainable to pretty much everything here with additional damage and key restore spicy so before transforming his main transforms him he gets a special arts card does some more damage it kind of reminds me of the yellow super vegito he is a double buffer for hybrids and sun family which is nice first passive 30 of damage inflicted for 20 timer counts when he shows up and then the following effects occur when enemy switches to battle uh switches characters while this character is on the battlefield seals enemy strike cards which is really darn good and then reduces damage taken so he's really meant to stop the um i don't know the flurry of fury of damage coming from your opponent he shuts down combo potential and then this is what happens after your opponent's done beating you up you'll heal a little bit gain some key does some more damage and he takes 40 percent less damage when he changes cover which pretty much all works together on that one after transforming his main 40 more damage all enemies heal a little bit less he gets a special arts card extreme potential it's pretty much the same thing as before just with higher uh numeric values here so it's relatively the same here but it's just much much stronger so um that's pretty much it there we're going to go ahead and run them on a sun family team using the super saiyan 4 goku to back him up and probably the red super saiyan 2 gohan just because he's also a hybrid sand in terms of the eclipse that he gave him give him this because i want him to be fighting alongside a hybrid sand this because it really buffs up his blast attack and then this you may be questioning why this but it's because of the special move damage and all his passive buffs are damage inflicted it's not like blast or strike so why not buff up his strike attack too but enough about that let's jump into some pvp all right match number one going up against a j-10 cure who is running a saiyan's team i suppose uh tricky vegito blue there gohan designed to counter him out all right here we go and he starts out with vegito blue gotcha we're gonna go to the ultimate gohan let's go let's go let's go that's the negative captain gonna have to put it into that here got you there about time to transform i think oh i'm sorry shallow you might be dead oh you may think oh no we have no key do not fret we can chain this in queue so far so good i likes to tackle quite a bit so i was thinking i'd go in on that did we get him no i wanted to go with the blue all right so far so good i want to get that green card in no no i don't think that's got a kill gohan gonna heal 20 of this afterwards which is nice [Music] did he vanish already i don't know one of these and then i think this is more than enough oh no it's not no go outside crap i got way too ahead of myself all right we'll throw that into the mix i guess go on helping out the gohan [Music] now part of the reason why i'm using the super saiyan 4 goku as opposed to the goten is goten has passes to help out sun family i don't want to skew his damage let's ship it for the next one [Music] uh right match number two going up against i'm not really sure he is using regen with the new boot tanks this would be interesting um we'll do this all right here we go and oh super 17 to start it out i'm going blast goodbye he's not switching at all hopefully oh crap i didn't

the side step we're obviously not going to become type neutral though because i think it's dependent on hp ratio or something like that i'm just gonna get the damage in i'm scared about him rising rushing the ultimate goal on oh we're gonna go for a tackle to get rid of that oh he just came straight to me oh well played please stay back all right we're gonna do this and then we're gonna follow

card there we go and we don't have to worry about full power showing up for quite a bit of time oh he showed up well done chief it's going to hurt we turned if he had a green card in there that would

with him i'm just gonna go straight for it all right it should be for the next one all right next match going up against tenon who is running sun family with the ultimate gohan just as we are here um

go and he starts with nema goku oh it's gonna be oh no [Music] it's gonna be a slow one all right there's all those sealed strike cards it would have been nice if i actually got rid of one of those

pv oh boy we gotta hit the paralysis we're gonna get rising rushed unfortunately it's just the way it's gonna go oh maybe not cool i maybe doesn't want to play with any rising watches if so then i

to purple super saiyan 4. he may want to rising rush this guy which is fine by me maybe not maybe he doesn't want to play with any rising rushes that's fine by me if you don't want to got him first how many blue cars did you have this man had all the blue cards you draw one more card ultimate gohan the answer is no [Music] all right let's see if i can get him with the green though oh there we go oh 610 hp all right that's gonna be the final match of the video [Music] hope you guys enjoyed i really like this ultimate gohan it's clear that a lot of his power is going to come from chaining in with his green card but uh he's a great unit if you're free to play though i don't think he's someone we're throwing your cc for there's an lf looming around the corner so save for that stick to discount singles um by the about when the banner disappears in like you know maybe within two weeks usually we get news of what's coming next two days before a banner disappears so by then you'll know whether or not he's worth it and if you didn't get him with discount singles then maybe you can throw in some multis if you're not interested in what's coming next but anyways i hope you guys enjoyed and until next time peace [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "5r7-z1DRz1o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "X6LwrJqHDQQ": "[Music] you also sister G Pharma TV here coming at you with another tutorial and today I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how to use the new and improved liquid gold vape pen comes packaged with just the mod and actually a key charger and you go ahead and charge your pen it will turn on red and when it's fully charged it will turn on green indicating that it's fully charged this 510 threading pen is compatible with both drug run and pure tanks 510 thread and cartridges and the first thing you want to go ahead and do after you put your cartridge on is simply turn on the panel by pressing the flash button five times five then you want to go ahead and activate the pre heating element by pressing the flash button two times we'll go ahead and see a mixture of all the colors and if you want to go ahead and stop it from the pre heating element I soon as you see the smoke you press that button once and you stop the creating mistake I do not recommend you to vape this cartridge while it is in increasing state after you're done preheating your oil it's ready to vape the first setting that it will go ahead and start off is when it's green setting which is the lowest voltage of the three three point six volt if you press the splash button three times it will then move the voltage from green to blue from the lowest setting to the highest setting at 4.00 voltage the draw difference between the green setting in the blue lady makes night and day I definitely got a bigger risk and it was a definitely a little bit more calm after the blue setting by simply pressing the splash button three it will drop down to the middle to the neutral blinking red you now know you're vaping it at its middle setting at 3.8 voltage now whatever setting you prefer adjust it try out the waters see what works best up for you when you're done and you have the voltage that fits your need just simply hold down the splash but in this pen and battery is designed to go ahead and turn off after eight seconds of date and automatically so we do this for your safety we understand you have lungs of Steel you get wine eight seconds of 18 per hit you can simply go ahead and let go before the eighth second and continue with your desire to have a bigger hit that's the small tip the new liquid gold vape in coming in assorted colors 510 threading and packaged with its own USB charger a new warmup feature when you click the splash button twice and you can go ahead and activate three voltage settings all color-coordinated by clicking a splash button three times and of course turn on your pin and turn it off with a simple 5 splash click go ahead and make sure you check out the closest retailer near you on G farmer navcom and if you're already making make the switch to a liquid gold vape in and save yourself some time I know what voltage you're vaping your oil and being controlled with the liquid gold vape in don't forget to go ahead and like this video and subscribe to our YouTube channel I'm Chris with Jeep farmer TV saying stay up [Music]", "yvUN86A1s00": "people are ready for electric vehicles manufacturers are ready for electric vehicles but the world a little bit less so and by that I mean the charging infrastructure certainly in the UK is left wanting that makes it inconvenience to take a car on a long journey it's also inconvenient if you don't have access to a home charger save you live in a block of flats so the solution at least for the medium-term seems to be plug-in hybrids this is the latest BMW x5 or more specifically the 45 II the latest plug-in SUV from BMW [Music] now if you cast your mind back you might remember that BMW have actually already made a plug-in version of the x5 the 48 and while a good car it was left lacking in some departments something that the 45 II that we're driving today hopes to address and the first thing on the shopping list for BMW II was a new motor to replace that for pot now this car is equipped with an inline six turbocharged and paired with an electric motor for an output of 389 horsepower with 442 pounds feet of torque that's a sizable amount of performance and paired with its all-wheel-drive system it'll get this family SUV from 0 to 62 miles per hour in just 5.6 seconds this might be a bit more geared towards the environment but the performance is high on the cards to driving enjoyment has always been a big part of BMWs ethos and it doesn't matter whether you're driving 7 Series limousine or the entry-level 1 Series the smile on your face is something of a prerequisite when driving a BMW now the x5 does a really good job of this in fact it's one of the best handling cars in its class but this plug-in model is arguably more impressive because you see with all the batteries on board it weights nearly two and a half tons but it dances around like a car half its size and white now it's a given that xDrive all-wheel-drive system gives you a feeling of being planted and ample levels of grip but the precision of the steering and it's keenest to turn in on an apex of a corner gives it an you know ass much more sporting feel for a vehicle of this size its scalpel precise ok it's not the most feel sim and that's probably the most cliched phrase in motoring at the moment but I have to say the fact that you can really chuck this thing around and it has the confidence to support you doing so I mean or in terms of dynamicism do you expect from a vehicle like this it's designed to seek far even comfortably which it does the material quality and there's plenty of space and you can put a dog in the back et cetera et cetera but it also handles like this I mean it ticks a lot of boxes talk about being a jack-of-all-trades and this 8-speed automatic gearbox as well is fantastic seamless shifts and really fast responses on the paddles whenever you request it okay let's talk all about the hybrid system because that's probably the reason that you're even watching this video as opposed to a regular x5 road test well bad trees have been mounted quite low in the car which is something that reserves them handling but it's also BMWs new fourth generation battery technology and I'll get you about 4 to 2 to 54 miles on pure electric mode according to W LTP figures which reports based more in the real world than a lab environment so not too bad at all in fact most people's commutes can be covered to and fro solely in electric mode so that's good news it's good news too for company car buyers with the 45 be achieving a benefiting kind rate of 16% again according to W LTP figures this cars hybrid drivetrain should net you about 148 mpg to 235 mpg dependent on how and where you use it so it should be reasonably frugal as well I really like that the car can be driven on pure electric up to 84 miles per hour but 0 to 100 percent charge time of nearly 7 hours a maximum of three point seven kilowatts is far less appealing if you don't have access to overnight charging live behind the wheel in the x5 is certainly tranquil because when you're in all-electric mode and driving it a sedate pace there's very little noise penetrating the Kabat that near silent driving is just blissful to be on this nice peaceful it's a welcome space after a long day at work that's for sure and particularly with this car's interior with its sumptuous leather seats that are just supportive in all the right places and ample amounts of space back there for the rear passengers boot space is somewhat compromised by having these new batteries on board we're down to 500 litres but it's still pretty usable and I do like the split-folding tailgating as you'd expect the BMW everything has a premium feel anything that looks like metal is metal the leathers the stitching it's super neat super tidy and just feels like an expensive vehicle the seventh incarnation of BMWs excellent iDrive infotainment system is present and correct and now features a huge 12 inch display so that's just a brief overview of the new BMW x5 45 II certainly a very accomplished vehicle and an improvement on its predecessor [Music] [Music]", "s3Pwhcuw4Wo": "everyone welcome back to my channel today I'm going to show you how to do your own pro at home with sounds little difficult but it's very easy so let's get started and for this you need a scissor a regular thread or you can take any pro thread if available I love this one and one spoolie or a pro press the next thing is you have to choose a length of your thread I always do like so and it's was very fine for me and as little practice met you know which at length is good for you and the next thing is you need to tie both ends and make a knot and make a circular 3 the next things looks little difficult but it's very easy you have to hold the thread like this and after that you have to rotate the thread for like three to four times and it's really just you need to do a little practice for this before doing the threading and yeah the first thing I am going to apply some face powder on my brows make sure it's very clean and the next thing is to know your direction of your hair truth I always love to start from my upper bra because it is less painful as compared to the lower through earlier and you have to know the direction and you have to like to the open hand motion to grab them here and if you're a beginner play with the kid for some time then just start your 3d and like so you will do your eyebrow and it just comes perfectly first try to remove the extras from you upper and under gross and after that try to keep a proper sleep make sure both eyebrows are he then I've been doing this from last three years and in between if I feel I'm out of safe I go to saloon in like six or seven months who wants and here it goes very perfectly like every time but these don't be hurry half peasants and do practice I think this is best way to get high protein my hair is growth always very fast but still this goes like three to four weeks so yeah depends on your hair growth and yeah like so you have to do all your hair [Music] and we can use a spoolie or a eyebrow press to know the extra hair you have always remember to know the direction of your hand code and pull the hair in the opposite direction it will makes lot easier to pull the hair and do your threading don't forget to thread your side rows because this will define your brows very nicely and yes [Music] the only thing I want to say is practice practice and practice I am doing this from a long time and I am so comfortable and I think this one is the best way to do your eyebrow quick and easy and the next thing is I am going to use a scissor and cut the extra hair growth on my sides and this completes the hair threading like the hypothetic and the next thing is to apply any toner or any monster I tore any kind of gel Here I am going to use the aloe vera gel it's works fine for me hope you all liked this video and this will be helpful too don't forget to give a big thumbs up and subscribe to my channel thanks for watching see you in my next one till then bye bye", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe hit

chiron yeah a bugatti chiron it's such a cool car now you need something to draw with we're gonna use markers but if you feel more comfortable feel free to draw with a pencil we also need some paint brain so if they did color with yeah something to color with alright let's get started yes we're gonna draw a front view of the Bugatti so everything we draw on the left side we're also gonna draw on the right side and what's that called symmetrical yeah symmetrical alright let's first draw the wheel so we're gonna draw two straight lines one on each side so we'll start over here and we're gonna draw a straight line down about that size cool now we're going to repeat that same line over here job and alright now we're going to draw the wheel arch or the part of the body that goes over the wheel so we'll start up here and we're going to draw a curve we'll start at the top of the wheel and right here we're just going to slightly curve in towards the bottom and we'll stop before we get to the very bottom yeah and then let's do the same thing on the other side slightly curved in right to the bottom good job now let's turn our paper this way the other way and then we're gonna start up here at the very top and we're gonna draw a curve that connects the top down to the bottom or the left side to the right side I like turning my paper sideways because I think it's easier to draw a big long curving or straight lines by pulling the line towards you good job man now we're ready to draw the top of the car let's draw the top of the wheel arch we're going to draw a curve comes in and we'll do the same thing on the other side we're gonna draw the same curve over to the other side now it's okay if they don't look exactly the same on both sides it's challenging that's one of the most challenging things to do let's see that my left side is a little higher than my right side and that's okay right yeah the most important thing when we're doing art is to have fun have fun and to practice practice remember to practice in cars I think are super challenging to draw anyways so remember to have fun alright let's keep going now right here we're to turn our paper again and let's draw a line that connects these two lines together that's another thing too if you feel more comfortable drawing with a pencil drawing with a pencil first and then when we're all done you can go back over it with a marker but I also like not using a pencil because then you don't spend as much time erasing you just have fun all right now right here we're gonna draw the side of the glass coming up we're gonna draw a diagonal line coming up we'll do the same thing over here on this diagonal line I want them to be the same length this is for the side of the glass or side of the windshield and then we're gonna draw the top of our car we're gonna draw a curve that connects these two lines together yeah if you want to you can turn your paper I think that's easier sometimes how are you doing such a great job Jack are you having fun yes I'm good now look at my draw and see how it's a little more curved at the top watch how I draw I'm gonna draw the glass inside now you wait wait for me to finish mine and you're gonna do yours a little bit different so I'm gonna draw these two lines this is for the windshield that's inside and then I'm gonna draw a curve like you that's a little more straight so this line that I just drew could be yours and you could draw the outside so start on the outside and draw two more diagonal lines that come up yeah do the same thing on the other side and now when you connect these two lines you can add a little more curve through the top of your car instead of a straight line there you go yeah there you go man get you home I like it now we have the general shape of our car let's draw all of the details that make it look even cooler okay we're gonna start by drawing the horseshoe shape in the front and this is the mouth of the Bugatti which is the coolest shape ever we're going to start really close to this bottom line but not touching we're gonna draw an upside-down U shape and towards the bottom look at the bottom of that u it comes in yeah looks like a horseshoe good job now down here at the bottom let's connect these two lines together now it looks like a Bugatti yes now let's draw the inside we're gonna repeat that same line go around as close as you can to the first line we drew and down at the bottom we're gonna connect except with the straight line right in the middle we're going to do something different we're going to come up and then back down there's a little detail in the middle all right now the emblem is an oval what color is the oval red yeah it's red and it says Bugatti on it I like saying that word Bugatti Bugatti now the next we're ready to draw the shape of the hood which is really cool shape let's add two little dots I'm gonna put them right here and one over here same on both sides okay now we're gonna start at the corner of the window or windshield we're gonna draw a line that comes down and connects and we'll do the same thing on the other side connect to that dot that we drew on both sides perfect now let's draw the front intakes on the side of the horseshoe shape we're gonna start by drawing let's draw a little point over here and we'll draw a point the same height on the other side then right here on the horseshoe let's give ourselves another point and it's really close to the bottom let's trigger a paper again sideways and then connect these dots start on the outside and connect to the inside and then we can do the same thing over here connect the two dots that's a fun line to draw especially when you give yourself those dots now let's draw another line right next to it just above it we're going to draw as close as we can to it we'll do the same thing on the other side and then we can turn our paper back cool Jack all right now let's draw a line we're gonna start here we're going to draw up to this chrome piece and we can do the same thing on the other side actually let's stay over here and this finish this shape and we're going to imagine this line going through that chrome piece and coming up higher then we're gonna curve in and connect to that horseshoe shape then let's do the same thing I'm going to turn my paper this way we're gonna do the same thing down here we're gonna draw a line that connects to the bottom of the horseshoe get some job let's repeat that same shape over here on the other side will first drop the diagonal line that's below the chrome piece and then comes up on the other side or above it and then we're gonna curve and draw the top of that shape into the horseshoe and then also the bottom into the bottom of the horseshoe let's try two more diagonal lengths we're going to draw one that comes through on this side and one that's on the other side now we're ready to draw the headlamp shapes we're gonna start here just above the horseshoe and we can put a point and let's do the same thing over here on this side drop point so it's really close to the hood line then we're gonna draw a diagonal line that comes out and make sure that you leave a space or a gap before you get to the edge and then let's do the same thing on the other side cool now we're ready to draw the bottom we're going to draw a curve that comes around like this and then we're going to draw another line coming towards the horseshoe but then stop before you get all the way and we'll do the same thing on the other side draw curved down and then another diagonal line all the way in odds look good so awesome now right here let's draw a diagonal line to connect the bottom to the top you'll do the same thing over here on this side what should we draw next Jack the mirrors all right let's do it we're gonna draw a horizontal line right above the wheel arch and then we're gonna connect it into the side now let's draw this really cool shape we're gonna start by drawing a curve that comes up and then we're gonna curve it back down and then for the bottom piece we're going to draw a curve coming down or in but don't connect it to that diagonal line yeah leave a little space and then connect it into the body let's repeat that same step over here for the other mirror we draw the horizontal line first and then we're gonna draw the diagonal line that comes in to the body then we'll draw the top of the mirror curving up and then back down then we'll draw the bottom of the mirror curving in and then diagonal line into the body the last thing we need to draw is the bottom of the tires we're going to draw a nice wide tire and then we'll connect it to the bottom of the car and do the same thing over here on the other side a really wide tire all right Jack we did it we finished drawing our Bugatti it looked super awesome except it's gonna look even better once we do what color it yeah this part we're gonna fast forward but at the end you guys can pause the video if you want to match the same color you ready to fast forward yeah [Music] Jack great job on coloring your car turned out awesome did you have fun yes you can be super proud of your drawing now we use markers and colored pencils we first colored our car solid blue a light blue on the top dark blue on the bottom and also dark blue at the very top on the roof then we use our colored pencils to go back over the markers we first use what light yeah how white to add this reflection it's really strong at the top and then fades out towards the bottom then we also used white for the highlights down here and for the headlamps then we use gray for the tread on the wheels and also the interior we hope you have a lot of fun drying your cars yeah we do you hope you had a lot of fun I'm sure your drawings turned out really cool now we'll see you later our friends good bye", "BHTOmfTNakE": "hey guys I wanted to share this awesome video of my

everyone it's Abdallah here bringing you guys another awesome animal crossing new horizons tips and tricks tutorial video today's video is about special trees yeah these money trees over here are growing something a little different than what you're used to seeing trust me we'll get into all of it but before we do thanks so much for subscribing and turning on notifications we've got tons of gameplay on my channel make sure you guys are on board with it and we are at 761 subscribers thank you so much every single one of you guys if you guys did not already see the previous video which is the money tree guide where we showed you guys the truth about growing money trees definitely take a look at that because we teased this video in that one and of course if you got some other things on board so make sure you're subscribed so that you guys know about the latest and greatest animal crossing content okay so you guys know me I'm always giving you guys the information straight to you and I've got the finger on the pulse so that you guys know exactly what's happening in the animal crossing community so we're reporting on what exactly is happening with these specific trees I like to call these trees special trees simply because they can house pretty much any material item on top of the leaves instead of money bags so if you in case you guys are wondering how exactly you get them simply put you don't there's no way of naturally getting these every single one of these star fragment trees or these special trees are fabricated with outside mechanics so you're not going to be able to grow unnaturally no you cannot throw in a star fragment into a glowing hole and get one no that's not exactly how it works so these things are going to be on certain areas of the internet trading posts because they're very very intriguing right think about your town and how cool one of these large star fragment trees would be especially maybe right outside the airport it would be like the cherry on top it would look amazing or maybe like a whole entire row of the different color trees symmetrically matching on the each side as you're walking through it's just another customization option that a lot of people seem to enjoy and I personally would love it if you can absolutely throw in a star fragment into one of the golden spots in order to make one of these cool things so Nintendo I know you guys are watching let's make that happen yeah I mean heck some people argue well you can't really throw in things because those things don't grow on trees have you seen the money tree tutorial video anything can grow on trees right just bear in a golden spot and then have it right it'd be so awesome anyway so let's take a look at some other trees that we can possibly fabricate in the game and other people are going to be doing the exact same thing right over here we have the very cool these are the crystal hearts that are going to be available in the upcoming wedding event so with recent cyrus that's going to be your main currency of how you're going to be getting every single one of those wedding items next up over here is the the very cool fish bait tree am i right fish bait emoji I love it that's actually one of my favorite ones I just think it looks so sleek man yes so anyway moving on if you want to be a true king of your domain and the king of gold and gold items and a royal crown and your royal robe nothing would suit you better than a gold nugget tree look at how beautiful this is alright what's inside these presents I don't even know to be honest I kind of want to shake this tree to see what presents they are so I might do that towards the the end of giving you the showcase but you can see over here you can throw presents on a tree it's kind of like the the egg tree remember from bunny day I know it's hard to heart to forget Zippity bunny but anyway so since your nook miles printer is broken now we bring you the crazy-looking milk miles ticket tree whoa look at how cool that is looking for some DIY recipes I got you covered with the bottle tree who threw those bottles in that tree alright looking for turnips that will never expire well look no further than the turnip tree whoa super fun but Abdallah what in the world is this what are these things over here I have no idea I've never seen these little seeds before you know what I've honestly never seen these seeds either this believe it or not is an actual plan how crazy is that I'll show you guys a little bit later once we shake this and pick it up but this is going to be a gold rose plant tree how crazy is that we'll come back to it anyway speaking of trees this is like tree suction right over here this entire area is tree ception it's actually kind of stupid but I don't know man everyone has their price right who would want a palm tree tree or a little regular hardwood tree or even a cedar tree how cool is that right okay anyway so it's kind of funny I think it's really silly some of these are cool for aesthetics but again this is just me reporting on it I'm not going to show you guys exactly how to do this but this is what's happening within the community this is what people are making this is what people are trading for so just be very careful about what you give away for these things anyway before we jumped into the implications of having these trees on your Island I do want to shake this bad boy just to see exactly what's going on so these little things these are gold rose plants so you grab the gold rose plant and then it's right over here and you can plant it boom that's it that's exactly what that looks like what's exactly in these bottles well it's a message bottle and inside the message bottle is a DIY that's interesting what's inside the presents I don't I don't actually know what was this again oh these are the presents that you're supposed to give another villager interesting all right so I'm gonna close the game we're gonna load this back up and while we're loading let's talk about the implications of having these items within your town right some of you guys have heard oh my gosh you know there's a lot of hacked items in the game is this safe from her for me you know I've heard whisperings that people have gotten their entire save file erased and I spent 700 hours on my town I don't really want to risk it well as of right now there's no factual evidence that anything can happen if you have these items in the game bucks but it's been confirmed that Nintendo does indeed practice in telemetry or the availability to transmit data of what the players are doing within their game so if you think that anything that you're doing on your Island is just you and yourself you're completely wrong because then knows exactly how many trees how many bushes how many items are in your storage they know everything about that stuff so with telemetry and it's very popular in app games because whenever you download an app game it says hey do you agree to the end Terms and Conditions yeah one percent of you guys actually scroll through and read it all fine print but the rest of us just click on ok and that's pretty much saying hey you know what they're submitting all the information to the developers so they know exactly what's going on so that being said the telemetry is being sent over to Nintendo to say hey adds up a regular old money tree has a parameter of this number this tree over here has a parameter of the gold nugget which does not equate if this parameter has the nook miles ticket so that does not equate what Nintendo does with that information is really up to them will they choose to ban accounts from going on Nintendo online I don't know I can't answer that question I don't speak for Nintendo will they be able to as soon as you log in crash your game and say hey sorry you can't play this game anymore highly doubt that so take it with a grain of salt if you guys like the aesthetics of them cool go for it find someone to trade them but I would say you know leave it at that anyway so what we're gonna be doing right now is we're gonna be doing a quick experiment of what exactly is going on with these five presents it's gonna be super interesting so let's go over here and we're going to open up these special trees that are wrapped in green over here but I'm not gonna open them up on my island just in case so what we're gonna do right now is we're going to go to a nook miles island and I'm going to open them right over that way so some of you guys are wondering okay well what could these money trees possibly be well I honestly don't know I was you know just just procured them and the fine print said hey go open them on a nook miles island just in case so the only thing that I'm thinking is that it's going to be a particular it's gonna be a particular furniture tree cuz think about it right so if you have like a little furniture leaf on there like what's gonna what's gonna happen when you shake that tree and the furniture gets on there okay anyway anyway no spoilers let's find out what exactly is gonna happen over here by spending one of these nook miles tickets excited to see what's up again doing this completely blind this is the first time that I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do it live with you guys are here so it's really interesting but like I said the intention is to give you guys a reporting of what exactly is happening within the Animal Crossing community so that you guys know what's up you have the finger on the pulse so random nook miles island here I come and let's hit it okay so here we go what do we have here the most common island grade go figure alright so this is a good spot better than any let's uh let's drop one of these trees over here actually you don't want to chop down some trees yeah you know what I'm gonna chop down the trees over that way and then I will and then I'll start planting them okay ladies and gents here we go I've cleared out a little path over here just with the tools available to me got rid of the rocks got rid of the plants and now we open up the five mysterious presence here we go first present is completely slipped out of my hands are sorry it's gonna be a money tree let's take a look at this one whoa what in the actual world fish growing on trees what okay that's actually hilarious alright well let's uh let's open up the the next one over here fish growing on trees huh let's take a look at this one your toy that's going to be none other than some sort of critter some sort of insect growing on trees I mean you know in the world of Animal Crossing anything's possible am i right alright here we go we're gonna open up this one whoa hey that's actually really cool that's gonna be blue rose stems you can see like the the actual like thorns on it that's kind of interesting I'm curious I'm gonna shake all these two and we're gonna pick them down let's see predictions in the comments is there like what do you think is gonna happen all right here we go plant this one next oh dang yo little heads yo head tree oh my gosh your royal crown tree imagine that you'll forget spinning tables and spinning crowns man forget shark models nah dude what's next boom okay so that's the furniture tree that we are kind of thinking was going to happen okay so let's start off with the the crown tree alright let's see what's going on with this and it is whoa weird okay did you see that yeah I can't even pick it up Wow oh that's so interesting and weird at the same time luckily we did this on an oak miles island oh my gosh yeah that's totally yeah that's no good that's no bueno alright so I'm gonna get rid of some other things nearby just so that like whatever happens doesn't yeah that's weird okay okay I have an axe somewhere let me chop down that tree so that we get a better view of what's going on and yeah let's burn it with fire because that's actually really bad haha let's burn it with fire oh so weird can I dig it out no it's it's an actual object so it's an object like fused into the ground I cannot pick it up I cannot do anything with it so very very intriguing about that alright here we go what's on tree number two whoa robots oh my gosh oh my goodness yo what holy triple robots Batman that's so weird alright I can't even reach this tree hold on I can't even I don't think I can even reach this yeah okay so holy robots Batman that was so weird and awesome at the same time but like again I can't do anything with these robots like I can't pick them up there oh dude and that one robot is fused to the ground oh my goodness gracious okay anyway um blue roses let's see okay I mean whoa wait that one just sprouted a rose on top of a rose it's like rose ception over here interesting very interesting so like again I can't pick it up oh my gosh I cannot pick it up at all weird weird yeah I can't touch it I absolutely cannot touch that and they are like a physical in movable object like you cannot touch it you cannot do anything over here so that's very interesting okay let's see what this is tarantulas scorpions oh wow whoa Oh weird okay real-life actual scorpions ah but of course with the overworld like case like the little icon built into it tarantulas scorpions oh my goodness alright so I don't I don't know what's going on over here but this is a little too crazy for me alright so yeah there's a scorpions that are just little literally fused over there so you can't do anything about it and then the last but not least I will show you guys exactly this one here where we will indeed go for it I'm gonna shake this bad boy and it's gonna be the last one what do you think like great white sharks coelacanths whoa there it is look yo how do we make a sharp jump and it jumped completely up that hill oh my goodness so yeah great white shark coelacanth I was I was expecting something like that so anyway there we have it that's pretty insane so sharks growing on trees scorpions growing on trees royal crowns and robots growing on trees but now keep in mind that that's exactly how these items are going to be traded with other people so if you guys know learn anything or the takeaway from this video is just be careful just be careful about who you're trading with online if you open up a present and there's a money tree in it odds are it's going to not be a natural item that you can get within the game if you do decide to plant it just be careful and I would highly suggest not shaking that tree unless you can actually request the cleanup on it because I know that if you do done like the builder hat you can request a cleanup of the area I'm honestly not sure and I don't really want to test it on my main island hence why I went over here to one of the nook miles islands again it's a not occurring thing in the natural game so you have to be very careful about it all right that's me reporting on the news just so that you guys are more informed thanks so much for watching whoa boy though holy moly what did you guys think of that let me know in the comments it was interesting like I love seeing these weird things that people can come up with trust me like the camo cat thing was absolutely amazing so yeah I'm curious let me know in the comments what your favorite thing about this is and of course let me know what you feel about the ethical implications of it do you think that people just stay away from these things and forget about messing around with the code of the game or do you think that it's a pretty cool design idea and you'd like to implement it into your specific game let me know what you guys think about it in the comments section below until next time we'll see you later don't forget to watch our tips and tricks playlist over here if you guys enjoyed the video and found it very fascinating then be sure to smash that like button and share the video with a friend we'll see on the next one take care", "cswzgdmo2v8": "good morning YouTube share the street are going to chili out you today sunny sunny sunny sorry almost done are we good to go how you doing sweetie good morning YouTube my name is Nicolas welcome back to my channel I'm falling over welcome back to my channel we are I am the cancer in cannabis aficionado I guess we want to call it so today we are reviewing blue diamond concentrate from Arizona organics so this is the Arizona organics that's what the shatter looks like it's a really nice clean shatter and then they started with different envelope store they don't have the logo on me I think these are just the backup envelopes so are you guys smoking this morning with your smoking on can't just be meat smoke and I gotta have people smoking with me [Music] basically what I do is I take a small piece of the shatter and I turn it into a little ball because it drops into the banger easier if it's in this little ball hamish now how you doing today sweetie so this is what I call a little smut ball so and I'm still token on this cute super cute adorable song from daily high club so if you guys haven't checked them out you need to

just gonna go ahead and give this a good try first [Music] this morning that kind of started out in a lot of pain started about 2:30 this morning we ended up with a colitis attack and then might I have an infection at a at an abscess tooth so that's been really fun I like me [Music] so I use the same trick I told you guys about I'll take some of my RS oh and rub it inside my mouth where it hurts and that'll help take some of that pain away and it does really work it works pretty nice actually the only thing I have to warn you about it is that it does taste really nasty so until you can get that taste out of your mouth it's really gross but it does hope purple didn't do good YUM an hour oh okay I've been doing a lot of oil or dabs lately just because of the pain and stuff it helps concentrate help me with pain more than flour does I have to smoke a shitload of flour in order to get pain relief from it but I can do one or two dabs of concentrate please don't sting me so not from the same sherbert shatter I have sour banana I have a few sherbert the sweet orange sherbert seconds sour banana sherbert and the banana oh my god it tastes identical to a perfectly ripe banana it is so good so as always guys [ __ ] cancer tastes like a tangerine having been out of bed yet I wish I hadn't been out of bed yet I got up at 4 o'clock this morning actually alright so time I got out of bed I woke up at 2:30 with just this horrible pain in my mouth right through here I have to go in and have all my teeth hold because of the damage that chemotherapy and radiation did on my teeth eat lemonade yum yum didn't go to bed till 5 a.m. I know those nights I've done that before too I actually do it more often than I'd like to so okay let's talk about Blue Diamond Blue Diamond is a 50/50 hybrid it runs about 18% THC and 1% CBD this is a hybrid medical marijuana strain that is created by crossing Diamond OG with blue dreams although both of the parents trains are closely 50-50 hybrids the Diamond doji's are found to be leaning towards the sativa side this makes the effects that are being produced by the Blue Diamond also to be moderately sativa dominant in nature this plant was originally bred by bio Queen the THC levels in CBD and CBN percentages of this plant were found to be 18% on the THC 0.67% on the CBD and 0.58 on the cbn the diamond og genetics of this strain are providing the Blue Diamond strain the denser closely packed but structures on the other hand the Blue Dream genetics are responsible for cerebro up lift up lifting effects produced by the strain as you breathe in the flowers of this plant would give off a sweet and happy smell that is similar to that of blueberries the flavor of this strain will also be hashey which would be more or less like that given by the roasted peanuts I can get any roasted peanuts I got tangerine this strain is known for giving the users through sorry this strains no forgiving the users of relaxation both physically and mentally this is also known to be a good mood elevator and is recommended for chronic chronic conditions like depression so with this particular one I'm gonna fall over with this particular one it's gonna energize you euphoria focused happy and relaxing to relieve medicinally adda ADHD anxiety bipolar chronic pain depression hyperactivity insomnia loss of a percent loss of appetite a PMS really somebody for PMS on here and PTSD and stress so let's see I started out this morning at a pain level of my mind it was pretty bad I've dabbed three times today as well as eaten some of the RSO to try to get it into that tooth and so my pain level now is down to about a 6 it's not too bad I know I can come down a little bit so I know it keep walking on man I can't remember damn I just totally lost my train of thought there so with November being here this month I am doing all I'm giving done telling you guys what I'm thankful for every day during the month of November because I don't think that we should just be thankful on Thanksgiving I think it should be year-round but I'm at least going to do this for the whole month of of November and I'm thankful for cannabis without it I'd be dead today and then it's really really true I couldn't handle any more chemo the chemo was killing me I was throwing up all the time I was having a hard time the depression was getting out of hand anxiety was just crazy to the point - at one point I had actually considered taking my own life because I was tired I didn't want to be in that much pain anymore and I didn't want to feel this way anymore um and I get it um I was able to get myself out of it I was able to think clearly and pull myself out of it but I'm seeing a lot more trending online about older well it's mostly older generation that are saying that if they're if they're opioids are taken away from them they're gonna they're signing a suicide pact because they don't think that cannabis can help them with their pain it can but you have to do it in the right dosages so you're gonna need to you know RSO is totally honestly the way you're gonna want to go with some of these just taking swallow that RSO it doesn't it doesn't taste great um you'll see I have a whole RSO diary on my youtube channel I would freeze a little discs and then I just swallow them down hold in order to get the relief from the pain that I had and it was kind of funny we decided to go ahead and do we made a hundred grams of RSO and we decided I was going to do the full hundred grams over a one-month period of time so we started out with the grain of sand sizing and it got me to where I was eating four grams of cannabis a day of that RSO and I'll tell you what I felt better when I was doing that than I ever have I still want to go back on the RSO whether or not I eat you I don't know because some reason the the insurance won't pay did you a biopsy to make sure the cancer is gone which doesn't make any sense to me um because and a lot of it had to do with the fact that I've refused Big Pharma's help so that's kind of what happens when you when you deny Big Pharma they want to either show that you're incompetent or they want nothing that [ __ ] do with you after that I wasn't competent I was just tired of being sick and that's all I was and I figured at that point in time you know something I'm at preferred to live the last several years over the last couple years of my life out of pain and comfortable in be okay so if you guys know of anybody that is doing this and signing these suicide pacts please talk to them about RSL it does help you you know they may end up having to take several large doses of that that are so for it to help but it definitely helps it really really helps with a pain I don't want to see any I don't want to see anybody committing suicide over stuff like this we all deserve a better quality of life than what is being afforded to us now and every time we go into you know the hospital or the doctor's office they're coming down there I mean they're literally jumping down our throat saying no you these are addictive you can't have them anymore so they want to pull they seems off the market but they don't understand that what are they gonna do on the in term with people are we just gonna let them sit in pain are we going to walk around and allow them to kill themselves without stepping in and trying to help it's sad it's really really sad that this is what's going on and it's gotta end please work as I said many many many many times I would door you to give me a nice wonderful thumbs up there and if you haven't subscribed to my channel please do I do monthly give some giveaways we're going to be giving away a bong for November forget that keeps on giving still not peanuts Oh spicy a pepper spice very spicy so I am very curious of what you guys are thankful for if you guys can hit that down in the comments and let me know what are you guys what are you guys thankful for and I think I am gonna bounce out of here I'm freezing so have a great day guys math up you", "RNY8uUjCWHQ": "[Music] Tenace [Music]", "9k1WHlel3wo": "today we're going to be showing you my crossbreeding update hello guys what's going on my name is Mark and welcome to another video of this is your first time here and you want to learn more about shrimp colonies and other shrimp related stuff please hit that subscribe bye and bail notifications so you don't miss anything it's been quite a while since we did any kind of shrimp update on these tanks and I want to do this specifically my cross breeding we're gonna have a look and see some of the results what I'm gonna do is I'm going to film with the GoPro like this and I'm probably going to put up in the corner some of the shrimp are as they have grown because specifically in some tanks right you will see a big difference like this one for example this tank I'm not calling hard enough where it is very visible because I still have lots and lots of small tangerine Tigers okay so this is something I will fix today because it is affecting the growth of a lot of the other simple like lots and lots of the Taiwan bees they're in here are staying small alright so like these ones here these ones are probably a bit 2 months old 2 or 3 months old and they're still tinier these ones are under 0.5 centimeters which is really really small okay apart from that the eye can see the tangerine Tigers have a crossbred quite a bit most of the first generation they're almost that size where they're able to breed again but I need to thin the herd I have literally thousands of Tanjung tiger courses in here and sprinkled in amongst them all are like lots and lots of baby time on these like here here they're all over the place to be with Taiwan bees but when you really look at the gravel like this just in this little square here I haven't fed them today right in there slick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 to a three to a four to five or six or seven three eight remain theory so you get the gist just in that space there there is shrimp okay and it's the same on the plants they're everywhere and here so that is something I'll have to fix the day because if you have too many shrimp in one tank the the other shrimp that you want to grow you simply won't grow but I'm not sure if it's just down to a lack of food or of its like a lack of growing space or with a lack of filtration because the filtration struggling to cope with the numbers and it could be something in the war or this preventing the shrimp from growing bigger okay so but I think personally it's just they're they're overcrowded a little bit so that is the story of this tank okay this is one of the tanks I have recently done again I haven't physically taken the gravel it but I've tied it up forever because it was becoming just full of them all gear a so this one is mostly horn water in here has a part many filter the barking probably just see there and the shrimp that are now in this are my steel blues that a couple of steel blues in here and there's one what would you call it now is like missourah blue ball it just has the black head so this tank is set up for me breathing Missouri blue bolt type shrimp this one that you see in the picture there is blue steel so that is what this tank is aiming for now I've had quail of its success with my zebra pinto blue steel cross so I'm going to concentrate now on the blue Steel's because I really don't have many of them I think I have like five to ten of that type of shrimp left when I really want more so that's why this this trunk is sale let's go to this tank this one has hard um a little bit of a redo I'm not sure if I showed you guys we're taking a shrimp from here before I took over 15 2002 babies on them as I've been taking more and more of the stuff out of this tank because basically I said guys what's happened with this tank is it has been gotten it has become full of this type of string algae no this type of string algae is a royal pain in the butt because it is really really hard to remove right when I mean hard to remove I mean it is it breaks up basically when you touch it is the only tank I have where this type of algae does this and it makes it very very hard to remove last week I took her about another five zebra Pinto babies from here and never cross transferred into the tank over this side but when I was doing I gradually I realized that I still had way more shrimp in here than I thought okay so this is this tank meant to have been emptied right on just in my view I could see another one here there's another one here there's a meal Darla in the back there there's actually a really beautiful Emil behind this ball here as well so is imperative that when you change shrimp from tank to tank that you give them a chance to come out ready because last week when I moved a lot of this shrimp I thought I'd go on all of them and there's still five or six shrimp in here okay so this plant my plans for this are I'm gonna make this into like a Projekt RED tank we're gonna try and breed some red is there preventer in here and I'm know I'm gonna try and do on my own as well I'm not gonna buy this rim because that would be so easy for me to do to do just to buy them and be like any other symptom crab but I want to educate myself it's also part of the fun as well guys but you know when you only have so many small tanks you can you could so easily just buy them okay but I want to breed them myself because I think they'll be cool to see because I see the variations we get as well so for me to do this and this tank specifically I'm going to choose one of my zebra Pinta meals that is what I would call a poor grade garlic see right I have some of them in this tank here I'm going to show you in a minute because these ones have turned their absolutely fantastically 4f ones and we're going to take your oh cool great galaxy f1 I'm gonna put in here and then I'm gonna add some wine red Taiwan bees to this tank random specifically I'm going to look for a female wine red Taiwan bees right when you cross a female Taiwan red bee with a zebra Pinto like pure gray galaxies ever been to in our case and we should see more zipper controls right but there should be the off chance that a female will produce a red one you see this big meal this is swimming the front here Hadley beautiful as well so we should get off chance of us getting the odd red is their prep enteric because when you do cross breathing right guys you guys will all know this maybe I haven't talked about before but black tends to be the dominant color okay when your first breathing like if you breathe a red great a crystal red for example if you breathe a crystal red in our crystal block for me specifically because they were Michelin's before I always get a mix of both but if you were doing a first time yourself probably ninety to a hundred percent of the time you would get black shrimp and then consequently consequentially after you maybe like in future generations you'd get the odd bred one that's how we got crystal rez to start with okay so the tank I showed you above with tangerines that was the complete opposite of this talk that talk about is too full of shrimp and this one is the opposite and you can see the effect is hard here guys I'm going to show you some actual footage of this as well but you can see these are the ones that we bred from the steel blue and the what they called the zebra Pinto is the black-and-white one release these ones look like zebra printers but on a lot of them you can see there's little dots in the head and there's a little little bit of dots on the undercarriage as well hopefully we will pick that up with the macro footage of my other camera and that classes them as kind of like pure greed they're galaxies okay not all of them some of them are still zebra print rows with the ones that you can see the are a dot on the face and on the undercarriage where the block is this is where they tend to be improved great galaxies that is how they are made right so these ones are still f1 as well so I'm hoping in the next generation that comes from these ones that we shall get some really really interesting shrimp now that should be happening sooner rather than later because I actually have a couple of the females in here are buried and they have been buried for a little while so every day I'm looking in here and I'm looking for babies and I know eventually I'm going to see them as just a matter of time before we do and another thing guys I want to mention is if you have one thing to breed lots and lots of shrimp right there a good idea is to get yourself something that is a fast growing stamp Wantley they see the horn work you will notice I have it and nearly all of my tanks now in some tanks it does agree in other tongues it seems to grow a little bit weird and I'm not sure if that's a pH issue but you could probably see the difference here look on the right-hand side there is lush green thick growth look on the left-hand side there is growing like stringy and a house quiver of algae and amongst as well I'm actually ticking as algea of this daily let me show you up here for a second look at this moss as an example I removed the algae from this every single day and it just keeps on growing right so I stuck four more in them all of my tanks look up there as well you could probably see them so I have horn war and all of my tanks now and it grows differently and every time I look over here seers grown nice thick leaves the stems on here but then over here this is the same tank and you can see there there is growing thin on stringy and has a little bit algae growing and amongst this I'm not sure why it does this I'm not sure if it's just like a phase the plant goes through when you put in a new tank or if this is just something this plant does it but imagine this guy this plant this guy this plant would be something like it does really really well in high light because I've noticed it grows really thick and quite coarse the closer it gets to the surface you can see it there okay so maybe it could be it could be that this is because it wants to free itself from from bad places if you understand what I'm saying like it could um like disintegrate I believe it is in a pure position to put somewhere else okay so hope you enjoy today's show you want to learn more about shrimp colonies another shrimp related stuff start

[Music] right hello welcome back to another uh glorious video and on a glorious day i'm sure this will be all riveting for you today we're talking about the new audi a3 um audi of york has lent me another car for a couple of days and this is what they've given me it's the new hybrid so let's i'm gonna walk around the car like we always do and then take it for a drive and show you some bits and bobs so i'm currently studying direct sunlight so i do apologize my eyes are a bit squinty i'm almost quite tired today so they're a bit closed anyway um let's talk about the engine first off so this is a 1.4 liter tfsi engine from audi and it's also got an electric motor and i'm presuming that this is the electric motor i'm not too sure about how electric engines and the hybrids actually work and where the battery replacement is obviously with a normal electric car all the batteries are underneath but all this gubbins here not really too sure what i can tell you though this produces um 204 horsepower this is the 40 tfsi e model you can get the tfci 45 e which has more horsepower and this takes naught 60 in 7.6 seconds which isn't too bad it's not too bad to say the size of the car it is a little bit bigger than the previous a3 and slightly higher off the road so you do get a little bit more road presence this exact model they've given me is an s-line spec you can get the s-line competition which gets you slightly bigger wheels and a little bit more aggressive looking this exact one is finished in mithos methos one of the two black which an extra 575 pounds as standard it does come in i think it's just plain white and with the s-line model you do have the upgraded 18-inch alloy wheels i just want to apologize as well for the actual uh stage of the car you might see it's a little bit smeary and i haven't watched this myself and in the glorious sunshine which is probably the only sunshine this is summer for britain now um so in the only sunshine with a handbook today and that's clean a black car and it's kind of smeared a little bit i have tried to do the best that i can but i wanted to apologize just in case you see that all audi cars don't come like this obviously so around the back of the a3 fairly basic a3 stuff they have changed the design a little bit so you have now got lovely fake vents just here and fake exhaust exits the actual exhaust exit is underneath the car like the sq5 that we shot a couple of weeks ago but you see you've got plenty of a3 badging 40 tfsie which is e-exciting it actually stands for electric i'm presuming but exciting is more exciting isn't it it's better i think you do also have the new led tail lights and headlights it's all very exciting stuff on the new welding interior massive difference i'm going to show you that now so on the interior it has a massive upgrade as you've probably seen on something like the golf r's the mercedes um a-class all those kind of stepped up the game um last year and this year so on the interior here you do have a much bigger touchscreen it's orientated towards the driver full digital dash and the new gear selector personally i'm not a fan of this small nipple shall we say of a gear selector but i understand why they've done it i prefer my um my rs gear selector shall we say um well you can stick it into manual mode as well you can choose gears like that if you need but all in all it's a very nice car we were just saying on the what drive here we do prefer the um the new angles of the door cards the new angles of the interior dash the new design of the air vents they've done a really really good job of upgrading the interior on this so since this is a hybrid car i feel like we should talk about efficiency because that is kind of what it's all about i'm a massive petrol head and um obviously coming from an rs3 and that's my personal car and it's been quite a lot of difference driving this but very interesting so when you set off it's in full electric mode and it's very very quiet very torquey very nice it then kicks in the petrol engine sorry so you get a combined of electric and petrol obviously the usual good stuff is when you let off the accelerator it also breaks and that charges the battery for you obviously these do come with a charging kit and you can just plug it into your normal socket at home and leave it on charge overnight on the drive up here we drove on the motorway and then some back roads obviously i do have quite a heavy right foot coming from an rs3 i think it is down on nearly 200 horsepower some lovely cyclists in the background for you there as well getting some good exercise um we did average 50 miles per gallon which i was actually i know the the camera lady is is shocked i normally get about 30. that's like on a good push i did a shoot in manchester uh a couple of weeks ago and got um 30 miles per gallon on the motorway which isn't great but 55 in this very good say we're going around some small back roads it has got a full ev option as well next to the drive select obviously we drive select you can choose efficiency comfort normal dynamic all those kind of good stuff the usual audi a3 kind of spec this one does have the ev button right next to that you can press the ev it turns off the petrol engine it's perfect for town doesn't use any fuel and yes i can understand okay i'm massive petrolhead but i can understand why people want that personally i'm not sure if i would get a hybrid car i'd probably get a full electric um currently the only full electric car actually like though is the porsche tycan or is it the tycoon yeah the thai cam i think it's the tycoon yeah which is um 80 000 pounds so not yet not yet but i do understand why people enjoy this so i'm going to take you for a drive will then strap a gopro to my head and then you can solve see what the experience is like so don't lose control so that is it for this video it's been absolutely riveting i'm sure you've enjoyed it but you never know you might be looking at buying one of these if you are i'd highly recommend it this one does come under just 37 000 pounds but you'll save the money back in fuel pretty quick and it's extremely high spec and the comfort the interior everything brand new very very nice so good job to aldi on this car if you did like this video hit that like button down below if you've got any questions for me as well i do answer all the comments leave one down below and hit that subscribe button hopefully in the next video we'll have something a bit more performance shall we say i'm in talking with audi york at the moment about getting um some form of new rs model for a day as well so definitely stick around for that and i'll see you in the next video", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I

[Music] hello youtube on this edition of the 420 budmeister we're going to be showcasing it's another uh beep cartridge it's the it's a hybrid it's a trailblazer globe vape cartridge this is the cherry kush it's a point five gram pre-filled vape cartridge equivalent to two grams of dried cannabis this is 35.99 it's your local cannabis stores uh what they say about it 700 750 grams per milligram so that's anywhere from 70 to 75 percent thc cbd is 10 milligrams per gram i think it's less than but what they see in the box so out of the 700 to 750 this one says 727 milligrams per gram and the cbd is actually 1.23 milligrams per gram so let's try this out wow we'll see if this one because i just the last video i did there it was on the what was that oh the even even streets it said it was a 510 thread count and i don't have a 510 thread count but let's just see if that was the problem because i got the same pen as i had before so let's just unbox this and see if this one works they're pretty sure so the last one was a 510 thread count but it's not saying that it's uh one of those push push systems so maybe we'll work on this one maybe something to do with that push system let's get this out of to push here little guys in the side here in there we go something gonna pop that out of there okay i'll always check now there's nothing on the top here remove this little rubber plug on the bottom it should just slide off it's got no nails it's coming almost there there we go okay this one looks a little bit different than the last one but let's give it a try hopefully this works you kind of choke doesn't know how to order another pen [Applause] okay so it says it's a hybrid you got a full cartridge just grab one to like they said it was two grams of red cannabis what this is going to be is uh it says this sweet pungent and floral flavor so hopefully cold start in the four ray trail blazer let's see oh that's kind of nice different hmm just kind of have like a flowery teeth but it's kind of cool that first hit you get a bit that's really nice so that is the trailblazer thc and this is the i don't know why they don't see it in the box but i'm here so that's 35.99 not too bad a little bit pricey but seems to be pretty decent so if you like what you've been watching if you haven't subscribed already would you please consider subscribing and if you give it

you awesome unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing every day sheet of piss by cookies this is the first time i have ever reviewed a strain from cookies and i am ecstatic to talk about it and to review it now cheetah piss for those of you old schoolers like me is an homage to an old-school strain called cat piss now cheetah piss from what i understand is an evenly blended hybrid it is a 50 hybrid uh sativa 50 indica so it is a three-way cross between lemonade gelato 42 and london pound cake 97 so let's go ahead i want to bring this stuff up on screen for you guys to check out then we're going to take a look at it together okay so what did you think of the cheetah piss let me know in the comments below now here's the deal this is what i want to show you guys yeah yeah that's a 65 price tag for med patients in arizona this eighth is gonna set you back about 70 to 50 after tax almost 82 if you are a wreck patient so this is an expensive freaking eight so let's go ahead let's get this bag open up and see what this stuff is all about here this smell kind of like skunky and sour and gross that's what this stuff smells like almost like a little bit herbally but like it's just like honestly think of cat piss how it's just like sour this smells sour and funky and here is the sack in and of itself so you guys can see yeah that's right two nugs and then i had one nug that i already broke down this was also a decent size nug but two nugs were pretty much the primary buds in the eighth that is how an eighth should look when you are paying 65 for it this stuff is so dense let's talk about it it's really dark in coloration almost a dark green but to the naked eye it kind of looks like it's light uh green which is crazy you know you wouldn't think there'd be such contrast but there's some purple undertones on here these bright orange hairs i really i gotta be honest i really like the look of this stuff it's not the best looking stuff i've ever seen but it does look good now um just very dense and again sour and funky is the smell the one thing that i want to talk to you guys about is just kind of some of the statistics this stuff is only testing out at 16.13 percent thc now to me it is absolutely criminal that they are selling eights testing out at 16 thc for 65 bucks it's absolutely criminal now beyond that what else is criminal is this stuff was harvested on the 30th of september they waited a month and a half to package it it was packaged on the 13th of november so that's a long time of drawing between when it was picked out and when it was packaged like a month and a half drawing so today just so you guys know is the 8th of february so figure we basically had all the second half of november that's two weeks all of december that's a month all of january that's two months and then the first week here so we're at about two months and three weeks almost three months outside of when this stuff was packaged this is starting to get a little bit old and you know how i know that it's old because when i broke the bag open and i put it in the grinder to grind up these herbs it just straight up crumbled to dust there was no life left in these buds so that to me is inexcusable and that's not on um you can't go and blame anybody for this other than harvest dispensary for allowing this stuff to be on the shelves for this long and still have this price ticket they should have cleared this stuff out so long ago and bottomed it out and given a deal to get rid of it and get it off the shelf while it's still fresh so that is a a business that is not doing right by its customers beyond just setting a new price tier 65 [ __ ] aids [ __ ] um but that's okay you guys i'm not gonna let that affect um you know what i think of this and my review here so when i got started before i started filming this review i went ahead and threw this bag of cheetah piss on the penny pincher's test to see if i could catch cookies penny pinching from our bag so let's go ahead get to the penny pinterest test now and see if there are three and a half grams of cheetah piss in this okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if this cheetah piss by cookies weighs three and a half grams like it's printed on the package here so you guys see this bag is still sealed let's get the scale turned on i'm gonna put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this weighs one gram and that we are all calibrated here okay so we just have a .02 gram discrepancy which means whatever i put on the scale today is going to weigh 0.02 grams heavier than it's actually showing so we've got our cup put on the scale i'm going to go ahead and tear that out so that is not affecting the weight at all now let me go ahead and cut open this bag of cheetah piss here okay the bag has been cut open and let me get this bad boy open it's got one of those goofy double seals so let's go ahead and see if i can get through that goofy double seal and let's get the contents put on this game oh yeah so we've got 3.67 grams with that point two discrepancy that is a pass on the penny pinterest test way to go cookie oh that is how it's done that is a heavy heavy pass on the penny fingers test so way to go cookies making sure that i am getting the accurate amount of herb in my bag today now today i am going to be enjoying some of this cheetah piss out of my arizer extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there this is the bowl that's sitting on top of the vape with the botanicals in it let me smell that more of that sour funk a little bit of sweetness in there but boy that sour is really coming out now now i've got my whip which is basically just the silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that's going into the bowl which you guys just saw sitting atop of the heating element of the vape the other end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler now i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today i've got some distilled water brand new distilled water in the second chamber brand new organic cotton filter in the third chamber and in the first chamber there it's that where that bubble sits in the down stem that typically holds carbon it would prevent ash from reaching the water but since i am not combusting this herb today i'm not gonna have a problem with ash getting in my water so if you guys are ready i'm certainly ready let's try out some of this cheetah piss by cookies and see if it lives up to the cookie's hype okay so very thin visible vapor on that first rip just more of that sour mist coming through on the taste let me dive in i'm gonna probably take three rips on screen just so we can get a good assessment of the visible vapor and how that is tasting okay so that was very very smooth but i'm going to tell you not really getting much flavor kind of like a sour herbal um just a natural tone it's very light and it's it's not anything that i'm really like i'm not really enjoying it so let me dive in for the third rip here and see if that gets any better okay so more of just that sour herbal not really any onset effects just a slow slowly like getting a little bit of um effect but it's not doing much for me i can tell you that right now now what i want to do is while i finish this bowl i want to go ahead i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification with 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this cheetah piss so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the cheetah piss by cookies and wow this is some colorful looking stuff i think the star of the show today are those bright orange hairs they are being set atop what i consider to be kind of on the darker side of butt to the naked eye it kind of looks like light green but really this is kind of darker looking but especially from what we're used to almost some purple undertones you guys see some of those interwoven dark green leaves that were trimmed right up to the bud unbelievable this bud is very very dense very packed i mean this stuff is compact very tight i don't see any excess leaf material there's certainly a decent amount of trichomes not completely riddled um i feel like this is just overall some very colorful and good looking herb okay so what did you think of the cheetah piss under that macro lens let me know in the comments below it's funny because i noticed my eyes are almost a little bit cash but boy oh boy these effects are pretty pretty weak for the most part from what i'm uh getting as my onset effects here and honest to god i don't mean to be uh mean or rude or insult cookies but oh my god wow i was excited to get this strain review over with to be honest and that does not happen a lot um i think the last time it happened you no joke was with the cookies medellin uh by the brand of lemonade who is owned by cookies as well um and wow this is just it's so lackluster in so many areas and i want to talk about those areas so let's go ahead and just start talking about it so how i do all of my strain reviews i rate all of these strains on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency are how effective this medicine is i'll assign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end anything seven or above is gonna get my dank thumbs up stamp of approval in the corner of this video and if it does get a 7 or above um i will tell you if i would go out and buy this strain again based on the price tag so let's start by talking about the looks or bag appeal of the cheetah piss so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys one last time and we'll go ahead and get into my final thoughts okay so let's talk about the cheetah piss from the looks category to be honest with you guys i'm not gonna you know i know i'm gonna blow it as far as just giving away the review but like this is the best category that it it had was the looks they gave me big nugs i love that these are good looking nugs you know they're not my favorite looking nugs they're just really dense the dark dark like almost purple in coloration um with those green undertones i love the orange hairs and i love it's just very very dense i mean these are like little marbles but boy that is what an eighth should look like when you're paying 65 bucks definitely lacking trichomes on the outside of the bud they are on the inside they are sparse on the inside of the bud but yeah it looks good it doesn't look great it's lacking in trichomes and this is just a little too dense for me but it's like dense like this makes me think that it got sprayed with pgr's um but uh yeah it's a 2.0 out of 2.5 it's good not great definitely room for improvement there let's get to the smell you know there is a smell here when you break open the bag there's a smell now whether or not it's an appealing smell i think is a personal preference thing the thing is that i gotta take into account i don't think even like we talk about this with orange terps and lemon turps and citrus turps which are not my favorite but when they're there they're there and if they're like unique enough they can rate really high i just don't see cheetah piss is somebody opening a bag of cheetah piss and being like oh yeah that smells real good the smell is there it's sour it's funky it's a tiny bit skunky um it just it's very sour and again it stays true to the name think of cat piss what your cat's piss would smell like you know uh you know they they spray their pistol like get things away from it um and mark their territory and i i will tell you that like i i don't think it smells all that good but the smell is there so it's like there's room for improvement i i'm kind of torn on how to rate this i didn't want to give it a one i gave it a 1.5 in the smell category because it's like there is a smell it's not really really strong but it is there it's just i don't think i can think of one person that i'd be like oh this is desirable that would wanna you know like this but so it's a 1.5 let's get to the taste i think that taste rings through to or excuse me the smell rings through to the taste it's just sour it's not really enjoyable like i didn't enjoy puffing this bowl i honestly it's very rare that i get a strain where i'm puffing it i'm like i just want this to be over i want to be done with the strain this is one of them it's not that it wasn't smooth it was very smooth my throat doesn't have any irritation or anything like that um it's just it didn't it's not enjoyable didn't taste good to me so i'm gonna go ahead and give the taste a 1.0 let's get to the potency you know listen people talk [ __ ] like 16 thc it's not like there's no effects okay there are some effects this is more of what i would consider a mood enhancer just like the medellin it kind of lifts you up but because it's low in thc it's not super psychoactive so it's still pretty clear-minded your body will definitely be a little bit chilled out your mind's going to have like rather than like that real pressure on your head it's gonna feel like someone's just gently pressing their hands on your head it's very it it's nice in that aspect it's just not very potent medicine um for me after a full bowl like a half a gram bowl i'm just left kind of lackluster wanting more wanting to have another bowl and after you know you spend 65 dollars on an eighth it should be one bowl it should really be one two hit quit to me i have a bit of a tolerance i take that into account but like this is just not that potent it's not like it's bad i gave it a 1.5 in the potency and i think it's probably is about between a 1 and a 1.5 it really i mean it's just barely making the cut in a 1.5 for me but because i kind of am like digging where it's going it's just a nice evenly balanced hybrid i want to go ahead and give them the benefit of down give them a 1.5 so let me run that back for you guys it's going to be a 2.0 in the looks a 1.5 in the smell 1.0 on the taste and a 1.5 in the boat see it's a 5.0 for this cheetah piss it's not getting our thumbs up recommendation seems to be on par with the medellin this is my first this is my first two experiences with the cookies brand burner and all that [ __ ] you guys why are you guys jacking this guy off and giving your money to this dude i mean burner no offense to you bro but you put the [ __ ] on the shelves and people are like you're in your [ __ ] corner like jerking your dick and paying you for this weed this is [ __ ] [ __ ] for the [ __ ] price tag like i literally if i didn't get the hookup on this bag i would straight walk into the harvest dispensary i would [ __ ] say i want my money back now if they said it was gonna be an issue or there's any problem at all i would literally rip the bag open throw the buds in the air and say [ __ ] you guys i'm never doing business with you again because i got the hook on this there's no way i can possibly complain but i will tell you this is just unacceptable for a 65 eighth plus tax 82 on the wreck market [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] harvest [ __ ] cookies and [ __ ] this cheetah piss this is [ __ ] this is the kind of strains that piss me off that i review because i review them because they cross uh you know listen cookies is is a california brand they're invading the arizona market trying to take over our [ __ ] market don't buy this [ __ ] let it sit on the [ __ ] shelves and waste the [ __ ] away burner get this [ __ ] the [ __ ] out of our state you want to [ __ ] stick to music dude seriously because [ __ ] you do make me maybe you're better with music than you are with this [ __ ] i don't [ __ ] know man but i will tell you dude i'd be embarrassed and [ __ ] ashamed of myself i wouldn't be able to [ __ ] sleep at night seriously if i was putting this on the shelves and charging what you guys charge i know you guys don't set the price but still this is [ __ ] you know they're charging more in california for this my god and i know people in california you're going to watch this because they sell this [ __ ] across borders [ __ ] this cheetah piss [ __ ] burner for [ __ ] allowing this [ __ ] on the [ __ ] shelves [ __ ] the growers [ __ ] harvest i'm i'm just not happy honestly i'm a jolly happy guy this is one of the most annoying things i have done is these two back-to-back [ __ ] strain reviews for two eighths that were 145 dollars for a quarter 145 dollars a quarter i can get ounces for 150 that [ __ ] [ __ ] on this okay so that's the [ __ ] deal sorry you guys i had to get that out i have been building up a lot of animosity about a lot of these companies go support connect and go support alien labs if they're at least they're putting good [ __ ] on the shelves i'm not saying cookies is all [ __ ] but this is unacceptable unacceptable the pr the price tag the date the thc percentage everything about it is unacceptable um you know for a top tier stream make it a lower tier strain you guys ever think about that i don't know maybe some constructive criticism it doesn't seem like anybody uh harvest or you know cookies or any of these big companies who have their egos through the roof is open to constructive criticism but i'm out here giving it unbiased review boov thumbs down don't buy this stuff what do you guys think the cheetah piss let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you guys want us take care of yourself and one another and i will see you guys soon", "qA0SzI3JpGI": "what's up everyone the Gotham collector here and I just wanted to show you my new cow that I received today by Ryan Eaton from brand evenings creations and I am blown away by the detail and craftsmanship of this cow just look at it like this thing is ridiculous I'm a big fan of that battlin movie Calais and I'm collecting him and everything but this one just has that scary mean Batman look that I'm going for it resembles the dawn of Justice of the cow which is probably my favorite coddles out of all and I just had to get it I saw that cosplay Kris had that cow couple years ago shout out to him and a couple other people on YouTube and I have to buy it it's just it's insane just look at this baby it's I just I've ordered it like a couple weeks ago and ran is actually really fast answering a lot of questions and shipping was super fast as well and I'm just turning it I'm spinning it around me like a little bit bit by bit so you can guys catch the detail I do believe it fits up to like a 24 inch chain and it fits me perfect I don't need to add no padding to the back or anything but since it's too new the urethane is like pulling on my hair a lot and I don't want to put like powder in it because I'm trying to keep that dark black look to it I'm actually I'm thinking of building a suit on Donna justice one I have to talk justice cow from Reeves effects it's coming in the mail soon and I got my I came from Minko creations and yeah I can do review on that one as well as you guys want but for now you know this is just amazing let me give you a couple close-ups so you guys can see the detail on it look at how's that like texture and it's it holds its shape really nice it does not have nose holes which I like it's just you can't see you're in Austria which doesn't bother me at all but like just it's in the theme that's like literally Donna just is and just one are literally my favorite cows like it's blown away and just for a couple hundred bucks can't get better than that and I believe like cannot believe I'm pretty sure that uh Oh Ryan sculpted himself so does his own design he took a little bit from Donna justice and probably a couple other inspirations this one is called the dream cow I believe but he's just amazing shout-out to him as well you can see the expression it has that like awesome texture to it the profile of the cow so amazing I highly recommend it so if you guys want to go get yourself one of those hit historic ft and yeah you will not regret thank you guys for watching I'm waiting for a couple of more cows to come in the mail I'm waiting for a Clooney won by iconic iconic effects and Donna just is from Reeves FX and I'm waiting on the mech helmet as well from free toys so yeah you guys have any questions let me know in the comments below the desktop crap button to next time stay safe", "mV_u5eZvgks": "hello and welcome to how to grow asters\nfrom seed this video is sponsored by the gift of food.com the first step is to fill a propagator tray\nwith compost the propagator tray has a transparent cover which keeps the seeds moist and warm during the germination process press the compost down to remove any air pockets step 2 water the compost. we're doing this now as we don't want to disturb the seeds once we've planted them step 3 place the seeds on top of the\ncompost always plant more seeds than you need in case some fail to germinate step four cover the seeds in a thin\nlayer of compost approximately 5 millimeters thick lightly press it down to remove any air\npockets finally add a label in case you forget what you have sown step 5 place the lid on the propagator and keep it in a warm place I recommend around about 20 degrees C and no less than 10 degrees C overnight step 6\nwithin a couple of weeks the seeds will have begun to germinate as can be seen, not all of them have germinated I was wise to plant more than I needed step 7 when the seedlings have at least two sets of leaves it's time to transplant\nthem into pots first fill the pots with compost next water the compost and then make a\nsmall hole in the center of each pot water the seedlings this makes them easy\nto remove without damaging the roots hold the seedling by one of its leaves\nand then carefully prise the roots up and remove it from the propagator tray\nplace it in the hole in the pot and carefully press down trying not to\ndamage any of the roots step 8\nkeep the plants warm and watered step 9 when the chance of any frost has\npassed it's time to plant the asters outside first give the plants a good\nwatering next dig your soil and then mark out a\nstraight line using a piece of string dig a small hole then carefully remove\nthe plant from its pot place it in the hole and then press the soil firmly around its roots repeat the process for the next plant, the planting distance depends on the variety you are growing refer to the seed packet to get this information once your plants are in the ground give\nthem a good watering step 10 keep the plants well watered within six to eight weeks flowers will begin to appear thank you for

"9qaAz_F5F2U": "[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] hey everyone this is my most recent video synth build it's a model number gvs09 and i've called it the vapor dream aesthetically it's a bit of a successor to the 100 pfb and functionally it's similar to the ifd but in place of the patchbay on that one up here there's a spot for this customized little mini lcd monitor i've got a neodymium magnet on the upper portion of the inside of the enclosure here as well as on the base of the monitor for easy attachment and it's got two dedicated hookups on the back for power and video output as well so i'm going to try really hard to keep this video brief as i've covered the functionality of my builds in previous videos so if you want to learn more about these machines head over to glikes.net in the visual devices section i've got all my previous builds with their own pages and each of those has info photos and some demo videos so on the right side of the machine there is a latching push button for power on and off there's also a switch to go between ntsc and pal video output the rear i o has a jack for power this runs on 12 volts unlike all my previous machines because the monitor doesn't require 12 volts this takes audio in via either an 8 inch or a quarter inch jack we have a vga video output we have a power out and composite output for the monitor as well as a primary composite video output and then like all my previous builds this has kind of the same layout i've got image shift up down left and right to push the image around we have a button right here to go into menu a where we can change things like the vertical and horizontal size the hue and the saturation and whatnot to adjust how our feedback is behaving we have a button to easily zoom in and back out over here we have our primary color mix knobs for red green and blue so we can dial out and in each of those colors and mix them we also have buns to pulse the colors on and off i do have the hue shifted a little bit so red is a little pinkish each of these colors are a little off but uh you get the idea up here this is our primary oscillator we have an on and off switch here this led will blink with the rate of our oscillator now with this switch in the down position it's running like an lfo and in the up position it's like a standard oscillator and uh right here we have three sends for each of the colors so let's send it to the red channel dial out the speed a little bit and if i put this in the up position it's a standard oscillator we can locate multiples of 60 hertz to build some scan lines in the color that we're sending it to then with the depth we can dial out how much it's actually affecting what color we're sending it to so if we dial it out we're not really sending it there at all and with the shape we can kind of make it a bit less harsh [Music] then above the directional controls over here this button in the middle as well as the switch are what let us freeze the image on screen so this button just lets us pulse that freeze we can also flip the switch up to latch it in place one thing you might think about doing is making an adjustment to the color and you can unfreeze it and when you release the freeze it'll make that adjustment [Music] [Applause] [Music] up here is the section for the uh internal audio amplifier so we have an on and off switch for that as well as gain for the audio inputs on the back i'm not going to go into how the audio input looks and works so be sure to check out the video i did for the ifd where i go into uh that in depth what i will show is that uh with this thing on these sends act a bit like a noise generator because at full gain the internal audio amplifier is a little noisy which looks really nice when sent to these color channels so here's it just sent fully to all three color channels so by introducing noise we can actually get some kind of vertical [Music] columns [Music] [Music] the vapor dream does have cv integration so you can uh work with it in a modular environment over here i've got a mother 32 so i'm just going to take the lfo out of here and we have an input for the red green and blue channel these are unipolar they respond to 0 to 5 volts so if i send it to the red channel we can control that color channel with the lfo on our modular and if we get that lfo up to very high speeds then we can build scan lines and multiples of 60 hertz with this as well nice way to start introducing some shapes and variation maybe mix that in with uh one of the noise generators [Music] green channel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we can try layering our external device with the internal oscillator [Music] so [Music] and then we've also got cv gate inputs to trigger these directional buttons up down left and right so we can take something like the gate output from the mother 32 and send a trigger on each of these steps in the sequence so let's send that to up so on each trigger it's sending it up one tick do the same for down and left and right and then right here we've also got a switch that will let us kill any of that directional cv input because if we're in the menu and we want to make an adjustment something like the vertical size the horizontal size we don't want our incoming cv to be messing around with the menu so it's just nice to be able to easily turn that off and then we still got left and right and an adjustment for zoom and it's the same over here we have a kill switch to stop the incoming cv for that as well and then lastly we've just got some menu buttons up here let me move this out of the way so we can see it a little bit so we can cycle between changing brightness contrast saturation and hue so if we were on brightness then this would be plus and minus so we can change the brightness to go up or down and these settings are saved in between uh turning this off and on but uh this second menu right here if we were to make adjustments these are reset each time so i'll typically dial in a nice starting point and then can make adjustments on the fly over here so if i were to dial the brightness way out and then reset this thing this brightness will be back up at its default so with the way i have it set right now if i turn this off and then back on even though i have that brightness dialed down a bit once this thing comes back on it will uh probably be i think uh pretty pastel looking yeah so then you can just dial up the saturation change the hue a little bit quickly get back to a nice starting point here so this has been a pretty basic overview if you're interested to learn more head on over to glyce.net and check out the visual devices section i might suggest checking out the video for gvs06 the ifd that's one of my more in-depth overviews on functionality and there's also hours of demo footage available on this youtube channel as well as my website this model has some features that others don't and it also lacks some features that others have due to the fact that each one of these is fully customized based on requests so if you're interested in having something custom built for yourself my website has a contact form as well as a dedicated form for video synthesizer commissions the vapor dream was commissioned by forgive me i don't speak french they're an artist run space for digital art based in montreal lots of cool stuff go check them out also hey while this is a fairly complex build the basics of some of this stuff can be done pretty easily yourself if you're interested in the diy aspect of it all i've got some resources schematics and information on my website related to some previous builds including things like the vgs35 a device that makes it easy to add some lo-fi glitches to a video source you should also be sure to check out people like jonas burrs and lofi future who've put together information that can help you get started with some diy experimental video stuff i've got a number of ongoing projects at the moment including some updates to these machines new standalone devices that i'm prototyping and hoping to release and some other projects that i'm really excited about so if you want to keep up with what i'm doing outside of youtube feel free to follow me at likes on instagram i also try to keep my website blog updated regularly with what i'm putting out if you like the vaporwave track that i made as an intro to this video i ended up finishing a full version so i'll uh put a link to that in the description and as always i want to say thank you for

going to talk about memory foam versus natural latex many people are concerned when they learn about the harmful compounds that exist in memory foam such as toxic flame retardants and formaldehyde these hormone altering compounds have been linked with increased risks to certain health issues such as developmental brain disorders infertility obesity and even cancer fortunately there is a comfortable product that is not harmful to your health natural latex now natural latex is made from sap from the rubber tree it is whipped into a froth and then baked into a foam it is a natural plant product not a petrochemical product memory foam is notorious for several negative characteristics its piercing chemical odor the off gassing of toxic chemical compounds and its tendency to trap heat so why is it like this it's actually a chemical reaction with your body heat that allows the memory foam to take its famous imprint of your shape without the chemicals and without the body heat buildup there is no reaction this is why many memory foam mattresses can feel too hard when it's cold and not supportive enough when it's warm and many manufacturers of memory foam has started adding other chemicals called cooling chemicals to attempt to address this overheating problem and this is why many people choose natural latex instead natural latex is much more porous and much more breathable than memory foam when you blow air at the Talalay it flows right through whereas with memory foam the airflow is completely blocked sleeping on memory foam you can feel immobilized it's novel at first but after a while you may feel as though you're stuck in damp sand and every time you change positions you have to heat up the foam all over again this causes restlessness and circulation issues on the other hand natural latex is instantly responsive and even more comfortable than memory foam for most people because it helps you sleep wonderfully on your mattress but not feel you're trapped in it allowing for improved circulation and reduced muscle stiffness natural latex simply provides a luxurious sleep experience now our natural latex mattress can be customized exactly for your body because it is built in layers if you need to change how your mattress feels you can do so simply by switching the layers out now a memory foam mattress is sewn shut into one unit so once the novelty wears off and your body begins to ache you're stuck whereas with a customizable natural latex mattress design like savvy rest you can exchange any layer your options are nearly endless learn more about natural latex at savvy rest home and thank you for watching [Music] you", "wZ_TOK7bziw": "[Music] do you know after you get excited initially about knowing your hebrew and you're researching and i was so excited i i did the teachings and stuff and then i'm like you still want to know what else is out there not just pictures from people on youtube and since i'm like the kind of geek personality i wanted to find different books and you know that i could that actually confirmed that the jews are black people i'm sorry i just i just needed to you know so i did find a couple things all right so um i have two things for you i have our notes i'm gonna follow with and i have a powerpoint presentation that i'm gonna be sharing okay and i'm even gonna do it on a slideshow from current slides and um so we're just gonna look through some literature and things that i have found and i'm gonna see if i can get rid of this can you guys see yourselves on my screen no no okay let me see how can i good all right i just i just got rid of my things okay so most everybody know the zondervan bible dictionary and its um definition that the children of ham are not the negroes correct great so um when you look into a book like the history of the jews volume 4 and um page 63 and it tells you that um pope pius v by nature a sinister equal equalistic meaning equalistic is another word for religion so that's one of the key factors that controllers must control is the equalistic sector of society which is the religious sector so he was a religious freak who delighted in persecution just the freak he treated jews as the cursed children of ham and when i saw that i got ah so that's recorded in the history of the jews volume four page 653 you guys may want to take notes if i didn't put that on your notes just so you can anything i show you is not a secret it's tough for you to like wow thanks for bringing that to my attention okay and everybody should be familiar with that um with this screen i am going to see if i can put my camera on myself not just life okay this book um is a book by um a jewish guy's name is maurice fishberg and he's talking about the different kind of jews the cultures of different things and he gives the definition of a jew and he says it's he's talking about the negroed type among jews is yet to be mentioned one occasionally meets with a jew whose skin is very dark the black and wooly they had long with a prominent oh oxy put don't know what that is you know but the face is pro-genthius the two jaws are projecting in the form of a muzzle the lips are thick large thick upturned nose flat broad and wings turn up so that the naturals can be seen profiled anyway this negro type can be singled out in enlarged assembly of jews okay well naturally because we are jews and we are judah so that book if if that's not on your note write it down page 125 and then we have more modern authors um hebrew is them of west africa and um this was interesting to me because i was born in jamaica so it says the hebrewism of jamaica of african derivative are not confined to jamaica among the western islands um and he's quoting an author called blair niles he wrote a book called black haiti um and she said some said to be descendants of jews mixed with negroes so actually he's quoting a white author her name is blair niles and of course she thinks all jews are white so if you're jews you have to be mixed with the negro you know so um that's that's that just want to make sure i didn't go too fast and of course it's in spanish so whoever speaks spanish jackie world this is out of publication um but it's talking about naturally this is the time when um darwinism was big and if any any scholar who's any scholar is on board with darwinism and stuff so people were talking about um phenotypes and genotypes and you know evolution and so it's like a big deal to find out who these different races are so this um particular um author writes the jews are comprised of four separate racial elements the jewish hybrid with negro in jamaica reproduces the assyrian type you know so actually says and guinea reproduced his most striking with this syrian type so this just some of the books that i find to just confirm to me and of course we got a book nature knows no color line this book you can download by the way so if you write this down you can actually download this book nature knows no color line and it says many of the jews who are banished from portugal by john ii went to the west indies stop right there banished by portugal that um was in the 1400s like right around when columbus sailed the ocean blue because that's when the moors um were conquered by the white europeans and they kicked out all the jews so so this person is saying that john bigelow he visited jamaica in 1850 and he said that the descendants of these jews he saw the descendants of these jews and said that they were negroid and maybe i need to stop right there and go to i'm going to go to some notes so i'm going to say stop share just for a minute okay and i'm gonna go back and give you some notes let's see what else i have for you okay so i'm going back to the notes because i want to talk a little bit um the moors well we just talked about 1492 what was happening in portugal and spain particularly and um we're going to go over something now but i want to read something that um that i found and i actually um have the reference at the bottom it says um the juice here i'm gonna highlight it if you can see my screen okay and these are in your notes as well this is talking about the way that the moors who are blacks treated jews who are blacks or converts right so the jews in west barbary are completely under the moors as if they were slaves they were forced to live in a town by themselves called el milia and the moors entered whenever they whenever they choose without the smallest restraint and go into houses without any ceremony where they take whatever liberties they please with their wives and daughters should a jew attempt to resist them more on any occasion he is sure to get a sound drumming or drop in as if his testimony cannot oh as his testimony cannot be taken against the more any more than a negro slave in the west indies or southern states of america can be given against a white man okay hold on someone else just came in i gotta admit okay so against the white man okay he is forced to pocket every affront and content himself with getting all the money he can from the intruder he makes no scruple of offerings for money their wives and doctors who are volunteers to the extreme so right here he's saying that the jew the jewish um woman are packed very voluptuous to the extreme and here you have the moors who are going in and um pretty much doing the kkk thing on the juice okay now why is this interesting guys and this is the reason why i switched to the screen is because history ties the moors into canaan and into israel specifically the tribe of asher okay so there are some who actually teach that the moors and and hear them so i'm going to show you some um some reasoning why there are some scholars who teach that the moors are i'm jewish okay so this could be jew and jew crime like we got black and black crime okay so follow me all right so here we got a map of israel okay [Applause] if you can see this is the older map of the phoenician states all right so right here it says venetian state look to the top if you look over here oh by the way look at the phoenician state it's small all right but you can see tyre you can see sidon you can see beirut and bilbos right okay so you see the kingdom of israel is cut off on that phoenician map but if you look at this map the kingdom of israel extend up to um venetia in fact you can see that little thing called tyre so when i when i when i compare the two like this you can see phoenicia which is actually um canaan that the children of israel actually genocide the canaanites let's be for real so they genocide the canaanites annex their land and these are phoenicians so now there is a relationship between the phoenicians and israel the tribe of asher so i'm going to go further does any everybody cool with that me showing you that relationship yeah sum it up again the relationship is what okay the moors who ruled europe for 700 years um some scholars say that they are um phoenicians which is another word for canaanites because this is the land of canaan that they that israel um took over so if you look at the phoenician states on the map on my right and you look at the israel map on the left my left it says asher so the tribe of asher has annexed the phoenician territory and took over their land yep so you have canaanite um israelite mixed so you have jews up in there the tribe of asher so when you see phoenician um think jewish in in a sense okay so then i'm going to bring this up a little [Music] and then when you read scriptures you have and buried on the map is phoenicia tyra and think of when you look at that think of that as israel territory but these are phoenician cities right so right below tyree is israel so isaiah is prophesying against tyre and it says this is an oracle tyrant oh way low ships of cautious but tyra is laid waste without house or harbor word is reached the land has reached the land of cyrus cyprus now why is that interesting let me see if i i'm gonna do this see if i have the the map of the phoenicians venetians by the way are known for their being expert sailors and sailing and hence that's one of the reasons it's stipulated that they are the moors that conquered um spain and portugal going over that raqqa gibraltar thing so if you know jesus's words in luke when he says woe to thee shahrazin woe to thee bethsaida for the mighty works have been done entirely and siddhan which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in that cloth and ashes so the phoenicians these moors are all over the scripture and very related to israel so so when when um here is a phoenician bust um founded in spain well where else you're gonna find this the venetian bus in spain because they were there for 700 years so this is actually in the museum of cadiz okay so the spanish inquisition which is pretty much um the overthrow of the um the black blues or the black moors or whatever mix you have in between the overthrow of the blacks um there is a book by the way called the accurate description of the new world and um on page 574 the author said he said the said king referring to john the third the king of portugal sold all the jews for slaves and this book is actually here if you want to buy the book it's 58 000 but here here is the here's the book i know that trip so here's the book can you guys hear this can you hear the video no okay if you can't hear it i'm just going to show you the books okay so i'm going to show you the book hold on okay so that that's the book this yeah this is a famous picture by the way um the picture on the left you can see the black america black um here you see that that's a picture of the americans [Music] yeah so i got the link i'm going to send you if you can't see it but that's a picture of the black american in the book it's in the library of congress um this is a this different things she's showing in the book i'm just going to go over this real quick because you guys can't can't um can hear it but if you can't hear it at least you can get a little glimpse of the book and i will send you the link i've seen the book on youtube yeah so i it's really good yeah so i'm gonna go back here and i'm gonna close the link off here i'm gonna close it off there it is so um that's the book but just to find that information from the book that's saying that the jews that you know the inquisition pretty much the so-called jewish inquisition were really um expelling the black jews and this is where pope pius would treat the jews like the children of ham and send them to portugal and they end up um in africa and in the west indies so yeah so here it is they end up in guinea angola and in saint thomas and as the other book says um in jamaica so um so that's kind of how europe became white and a lot of us from these african and island countries it just shows where we migrate how we actually we didn't migrate we were just expelled okay so here's another um thing i found i'm gonna go back to my slide that tells you that elizabeth the first um in 1596 and then 1601 two different periods um expelled all the [ __ ] and blackmores from england wales and ireland it would appear that many who were servants or slaves were resold to other countries so um this writing lets you know two things this is just me okay you got the [ __ ] and you got the blackmores um anybody want to contribute their idea as to why that would be why what would be why why the writing why this woman would refer to um the [ __ ] and the black amores being um expelled because you got jews you got israel israelites and morse two separate people yeah you got the [ __ ] who are definitely the [ __ ] jews and the blackmores who are the phoenicians you know and they got used to by the way that is from a book called the um american discovery of europe by jack forbes on page 175. so if this is not in your notes please take a note of it the american discovery of europe by jack forbes page 175 from that theory yeah so everybody has these notes so i'm going to go back to my powerpoint and we talk so so this is how so let's go back and relate what we talked about to this slide that it said many of the jews who were banished from portugal by john ii settled in the west indies so now we know that the jews and the moors that were banished during the jewish inquisition and just the overthrow of europe from black hands to white hands were sent everywhere and some were settled in the west indies and then john bigelow who visited jamaica in 1850 he said the descendants of these jews their descendants were these jews and that they were negroids and that's the nature knows no color line okay did i lose anybody no okay i i wanted to tie in the um the moors and how a lot of us got to jamaica and the islands and africa from that okay um this one i found earlier on and this one is new to me i don't know if it's new to you but um this is the journal of a residence in ashanti um i actually ordered this journal there is a company that sells um books that are out of print and they reprint them and this is one of them so i ordered this book so anyway it talks about the jews of sudan and i was happy to hear that because um it tells you here in the 1892 chambers encyclopedia dictionary of universal knowledge volume 9 that sudan is the home of the true negro race so when it says the jews of sudan i know that sudan is the home of the true negro race which is actually like clear half a wisdom so in fact it says here that um they were referred to as yahoodi or judah right there okay so i'm gonna next slide okay if i'm going too fast let me know um so here we have a book by maurice fishberg we mentioned him already we're not seeing it you're not seeing it we're still on jews in the caribbean number three oh let me okay so i'm going to change the slide um hold on all right how was that yeah we see that okay thank you cat make sure you catch me thank you jacqueline okay so here it is the jews of sudan the journal of the ashanti and then here is the dictionary at the bottom that tells you the 1892 dictionary chambers encyclopedia dictionary of universal knowledge volume 9 actually tells you that sudan is the home of the true [ __ ] race so these jews who are called yehudi there it is um so that was a fine so the journal of residence in ashante comprising notes and re research relative to the i don't know what the rest of that is but that's enough to google you can actually purchase this book um from that company and that's page 106. all right what should i charge um it wasn't it wasn't expensive it was it's a company that actually reprints a lot of these old out of print books like that's their business yes just so i couldn't bring a lot of my library to costa rica but i did bring some precious few okay so has everybody seen the new slide yes yes all right good good so on page 49 of this book it says it is stated that the felicias are not the only jews of the negro race sebastian speak of negro jews living on the lowango coast in western africa they are called the mavambu or the judeos yeah so and at the bottom it says the most curious class of negro jews is said to have existed in jamaica and suranam man guys one day i'll tell you how i actually um got woke through a dream and the more i find out how jews were so connected to jamaica i was like oh my god now i know what's going on thank you thank you father all right so so here it is back to the journal of the ashanti this is a white guy who actually lived um in west africa among the ashanti people um for a while and um that's why um he did this book so you know he was saying these tribes where the hebrews are african wondered it is it is believed from the neighborhood of upper egypt while the children of israel were held in captivity so he is saying that these people the ashantis um are people from the captivity who wondered um from israel at least that's the story they tell him you know like there the israelites and true captivity they wandered from israel and so we've heard if you are you know i think everybody here has had some background knowledge of our history roots that how we traveled from israel well this is a documentation from the people themselves giving their testimony to this guy saying that they're hebrews and they wander from the neighborhood of upper egypt which is aka our neighborhood um while they were in captivity so that that was a good a good find okay um this one goes back to um john olgaby just confirming um that the jews in spain were um sent to guinea angola and saint thomas this one we covered already even though i didn't have a picture of the original print this is this is from the book the image from the book itself okay we did that okay no oh i didn't go too fast but we did this one everybody knows that one so i'm gonna go down all right now this one oh my gosh this is a good one um and i know that i i have another slide where i give credit where credit is due to the um one of our own scholars who discovered this and if it wasn't for his discovery i would have known it because everything else is an original discovery this one i discovered from someone else discovering it and pretty much sharing it with us this is from the sanhedrin 94 a this is from the talmud itself so for those who don't know the talmud is the holy writings kind of like the bible with the jewish sages keep their keep their writing in like the bible have the prophets of israel jeremiah joel hosea etc the talmud has the writings of the jewish sages all right and this is from their and they said that when he exiled the 12 tribes which we read about in chronicles and first kings he exiled them to africa there it is right here so in dear talmud it actually tells where they exiled them to and another place we went to is the se lug mountains [Music] which i forgot where that is but i think it's beside the black sea did i saw the writing and that's what i saw okay so here is a cool book i don't think this is in your notes because i was after i sent the notes i was working on you know making the slides match the notes and stuff like that but this book is the jewish expositor okay and friends of israel it's actually a composite of different journals or letters or anything regarding israel um and so you have different sections from different people so they would say dear editor or dear something and then they would contribute so this one is contributions concerning the american israel the american indians is israelites and so this is on page 33 to 3338 so it's five pages and it talks about the history of the american indians and by james adir he was a traitor with the indians and he resided there for 40 40 years right and of course people said um after a long time trading i was forced to believe up i was forced to believe that to believe them linearly descended from the israelites so they had um had been nine tribes and a half of israel were carried off by manchester king of caesarea and settled in media continued their long it's very probable he's very saying that they ended up in the americas you guys won't need a time to read that so i'll just shut up awesome yeah it says by the way the book of ezra confirmed you know i mean that can but you know matches the theory that the american indians came here when um the assyrian king um captive captive famine it pretty much took down israel period and only left the southern tribe and um they came to the americas so um here it still continues to talk about um their relationship between them and um being jews and um actually you know the whole americans it's not just u.s you know mexico um central america south america all of those um people there's history to substantiate that um they are of the northern tribe of israel this can be a bit overwhelming well you know it's it's at least it's an introduction yes wow you know so and then you have other explorers like captain cook or um giovanni the italian um explorer giovanni de varaza i just totally butchered these people who have journals to um confirm that um evening americans the carolina indian he's black um like the ethiopian not like not like the ethiopian in that they're here it's black and thick um physically well portion broad chest strong arms you and um i remember in a dictionary that i i got and i have it somewhere that says that the indians are copper-colored people so when you see white indians um like a lot of the people who are white indians they're not real indians what happened in history so i'm just gonna stop and tell you this um the united states government was giving away land um to india right craft land when they were still giving away like a gazillion acreage back in the day right well the whites wanted the land and so they would pay five dollars to the representative of the government to be american indians and get the land so that's how they got the land they were five dollar indians so the white man actually stole the land and stole the ancestry so a lot of um whites i remember reading this white man he was shocked he did his dna and he was all european and he couldn't figure it out because as long as he knew he was american indian so but he was a five dollar indian so um wow so here's another um i'm gonna go ahead real quick because i gotta show you something let me see if i can go back into your notes we talked about um asian people they're asiatics and so when you see like a museum like the oriental asiatic um asiatics um it's all about black people so um this is basically if you have um israel um assyria all of that land um the euphrates going into india southern india um china all of this is this is black people territory okay and um so this is um kind of places where israelites were banished to if you are in captivity like from the like like they said in this case king sargan so but to let you know there's a nice oriental museum in um chicago and when i lived there i didn't even know you know i i didn't know it was a black people museum i totally missed it didn't know where in chicago yeah i would pass it all the time and had no interest didn't know okay so i know that we all know that the jews are converts but i found this writing right in that little book and this is actually russian papers um and they are papers that's um pretty much telling the um outlining the rights of the jewish converts so it says we're happy to be able to submit to our readers an entire copy of the late ukc of you of the emperor of russia on behalf of converted jews literally translated from the german so so here in this book beginning page 384 it actually outlined government papers that were specifically to the jewish converts so here you have other documentation from the government confirming that these russian jews are converts okay exactly [Music] yeah so there i'm just saying there it is legal documents government documents yeah and here this is um also in the jewish um expositor um there is a explorer his name is riley and he travels to these cities that i don't know where they are but um he was in jerusalem and um he said that um he spoke with the priest and the speak priest spoke spanish and um he talked the priest tell him about you know who inhabited um jerusalem he said like 30 000 turks 20 000 jews armenians and greeks and that there is a brisk trade that's been carried on there mainly by the jews um and they've trade with persia constantinople chakra and all of that right and of course they pay tribute to the government the grand signier but check it out check out the language that these jews spoke in jerusalem espanol i knew jacqueline would be like hey what what what's your try baby zebulon when i read that i was like i was like i know one person is gonna be [Music] so there was a time where the predominant language of jerusalem among jews was not hebrew but spanish yeah so here is a picture of um fairly modern picture of relatively speaking of sephardic jews yeah moorish ancestry that's that's where they are so of course the bible itself records and people with a you know with a background i'm sure everybody has seen this picture on the right but on the left i found this picture because it actually shows you how large this exhibition is in the british museum so i wanted to um to show you this that king neharab as recorded in second chronicles 32 9 when he overthrew um israel northern tribe and he was so proud of it this was a grand relief it wasn't just a little thing because the one in the right is the only one we know so i just wanted to show i mean i was impressed how big it is okay and this is a sketch of kingston and harab's palace and and this is this is the king who overthrow um final overthrow of the um tribe of the northern tribes of israel brought them here um they came from here to the americas and it's within this palace um sketch done based off of the the ruins um that we have this room within that palace so um this one is transcript from the black jews and this one is one primary language um and what i'm missing here is a full title so what i would do if i was you i would put one primal language and put some key words in if you're taking notes but i want to read this to you this is where um they talked about the jews of mal malabar and the um jews at cochin which is india and yeah i got a video about even the coaching indians they're from india so those are part of the oriental asia orientals and they have two taurus scrolls and these taurus crows were in goat skin dyed goat skin the manuscript and the jews from the cochin community which are indian jews um traced back now those i believe everything in me that they are from the last tribe of israel from everything i read about them so you got white jews from india who don't have a a past and they rival with the um dark-skinned indian jews who have their own taurus scrolls from antiquity to show who they are just making a point okay so here um same author he wrote that the largest scroll can be a history of the jews of cochin and malabar from the time of the babylonian captivity down to the successive settlements of the portuguese the dutch and the english in indonesia so they actually have their taurus scrolls in ghost skin from antiquity bible times from when kingston we just saw his palace kick them out until colonial times how deep is that very cool hold on i gotta repeat this these indian jews the joseph kochin they have their original taurus scrolls on goldskin from antiquity from whence kicked about the northern tribe until conor colonial era wow i'm i'm just saying that's it just boggles my mind i'm just bottles my mind okay so this naturally you guys can't hear it but it's not gonna stop me from from talking through it okay so they cooked the coke chin juice so this is what's going on the cochin jews which is not these people by the way the coaxing jews are not they are my all migrating to jerusalem right this is the sad story so there is no more coaxing jews in the last synagogue so since they don't have 10 people to have a meeting which is kind of in in their you know torah or their talmud you need 10 people to have a meeting of men so they're not meeting and because they're not meeting no nobody's using the synagogue so this indian jew um look at this amazing i mean wow so this indian jew met another european jew and the european jew went back and said you know what we're gonna get a whole bunch of jews to come back to your synagogue and we're gonna meet together so that's why they're here having like a historic meeting in in in the in the synagogue of cochin so this this indian guy here he is this indian man he is like one of the last few it's a trip i'm sorry people so here so here you have these these jews who have kept their cells and their culture and their torah from assyrian days this is before babylonian captivity by the way this is pre-babylonian captivity this is how long they have kept their torah from pre-babylonian captivity till colonial times and now ain't nobody there wow there are they have so they have drank the kool-aid and have gone to jerusalem yeah which the bible says stay out of jerusalem because jerusalem is currently trampled down by the gentiles yeah so anyway all is well you got your feet across so here in this book this is just more substantiation that the blacks of portugal that they sent to africa and all over and the jewish inquisition are black people thus the black colors found not only in individuals as the black jews of portugal but in tribes as the big grass on the red sea um let's not forget the red sea our territory whose hair and characters are perfectly semitic yeah okay so let me just continue mother hair what do they mean by the hair is oh whose hair and character are um black and kinky oh by the way black and kinky black and wooly okay and the white color in the brutalized descendants of certain irish of ulcer whose features are almost of the african type wow yeah this is um you know we you know because we're everywhere but you see in previously how we read how the queen kicked us out of ireland you know so anyway um this is stuff talking about definition race uh how they have an african look well we know that because they are the moors but this is good to know the book i got this it's not just another resource called the races of men robert knox this i can you can download online so the races of men robert knox i got this on page 13. and of course a more recent book the history of the black man before slavery you can write that one down so page 1991 talk about the jews in ghana just just other resources for you appreciate it okay now this one this this this is the one remember i told you that in the um the talmud they tell you specifically that they um that the jews um left israel and went to africa this is actually a a letter and i told you that the talmud is written by jewish sages just like um and my phone is just like 10 30 ah it's over an hour um get back to what you're saying khloe so i told you that in the talmud it's been like the jewish sages write their holy writings like in the bible the prophets write their holy writings right you know so um here they're telling you um that the tribes they settle um over by the rivers of kush um this this is a letter that the israelites from africa went to jerusalem where they left because they were exiled here is a letter from one of the jewish sages that's in the talmud one of the jewish holy revered sages being sent this is proof they sent a letter to the jews in africa asking them to come back to jerusalem to teach them judaism and this letter is in the talmud and this is is the name of the sage the revered sage in judaism and his students sent a letter to the tribe of dance that were in africa asking them to come back and here is a copy of it it's in hebrew and english and it says so i'm just gonna read it bill nagowan students letter to the dispersed tribes of israel in west africa the students of one of the european jews greatest sages bill nagowan were seeking out the jews and i quote in the land beyond the rivers of nabiya kush west africa where the israelites were and i quote constantly involved in taurus studies asking teachers to come to jerusalem to teach the european converts and here it is and we went what else do we do wow so i would like to thank zion lex adviel ben levi who is like off the hook he's always debating um that's zion lex so you may want to write his name down just for the heck of it he's got a youtube channel facebook adviel ben levi so you want to check out i'm going to give him kudos so i'm going to go through real fast here um so here we're going to go through the art part a part b is easier because it's just pictures no reading okay so here i actually showed this image before this is from the book views of the biblical world notice the black people this is actually about jews but nobody pay attention that they're black people here we got pictures historical um history of the jews the jewish people i got the book can you guys see the book i don't know if you can see me anyway i got the book okay and um so those are some pictures it's heavy but i brought it with me um so here um you have i told you that we were in we actually ruled europe for like hundreds of years and this is the second story of a building and this is very common i understand that the statues are in the second sort of buildings in germany and um here we have the the negros and here in switzerland and then um we have the moors and up to this day they have a festival of moors and you see these white people paint their face black yeah yeah but but this is part of their history this is part of their moorish history so um it's it's a celebration we don't have stuff like that in america do we no no but they're celebrating their history they know their history there you go that's a trip right yeah oh boy okay hold on okay okay here so this this is four minutes you cannot see if you cannot um hear this video as you have told me but i am going to um just show you some of the this is christ figures and religious figures i'm gonna stop it like one minute in but you guys can just to give you an idea that's the black christ and stuff they were showing you wow there is the black christ in the corner painting okay so um i just wanted to like give you a little flavor are you trying to make me cry in front of everybody this one do you know have any any of you guys ever heard where they say well king james is black no never this is the first time ever really they say i mean they don't they normally say this is a fake one this is just um yeah always so always a fake one well i'll tell you where this is this is actually in edinburgh in the united kingdom it's in the new college library i definitely would put that down yeah so so nobody made that up it's actually in the new college library in edinburgh in the united kingdom and that's where this image comes from come on is this from a synagogue i i remember in dura and i couldn't remember a durawheel so i left it blank but this is a mosaic tile showing abraham and the sacrifice of isaac that's the lamb right here that's carrying the wood abraham and in the jewish synagogue and here of course they're blacks and this is my last slide and this is to show you the things that we have to come against to find um materials about being black and being israelite because here you have a young man and he has a series of books um and he copies these things that he finds so he writes the art of the ancient black hebrews so you're looking at images look how much amazon is selling his book for just this little little book the brother is trying to do stuff man he has quite a you know quite he does a set of these things look you see that that's the attack of what we still have to go through you know so thank you guys um for participating any last words before we close out", "DCywtP2oaxc": "our team has asked all the time if roses can be grown in containers and I'm happy to say that roses can do really well in containers and it's a great way to bring in color into a hardscaped area [Music] hi my name is Ben with heirloom roses I'm gonna walk through the simple steps of selecting the right container for your roses planting your roses into a container and the easy things you can do to make sure that rose stays healthy in that container for a long period of time [Music] one of the most important things about growing roses in containers is selecting the best sized container so we always say that in containers with roses bigger is better and the bigger the container you can do the better so we have these larger ones here which are optimally suited down to the smaller one and the smaller one is approximately three gallons and that's about as small as we would go when you're selecting a container there's usually a vast array of the expensive two they're really inexpensive and it doesn't really matter too much but certainly selecting the size is the most important so this is about a three gallon container here it's a nursery pot we grow a lot of roses in these at the nursery we hold them in these containers sometimes for two or three years and that's where we take some of our cuttings from in the winter and then we have this larger nursery pot here and this is a really cost effective way to get a container so if you want to get started and you don't want to spend a hundred dollars on a container this will do fine and it can look really nice especially when you get your rose planted and get companion plants around it so don't be afraid of a less expensive option to get started the second most important thing when selecting container is to make sure that there's good drainage a lot of containers you'll find don't have drain holes in the bottom and it's imperative that they have drain holes roses don't like to sit in water and if you're watering that Rose with no drain hole it's gonna do terrible most ceramic pots will have a drain hole in the bottom this one has one these larger ones will have multiples if it's a wooden or plastic container with no drain holes you can go ahead and drill some and what I say is maybe three or four one-inch holes in the bottom of a container is adequate whenever I'm planting in containers we use a good potting soil this is a bag of potting mix that we got at our local feed store your garden center should have that what I would watch out for is anything that has fertilizer in the mix sometimes these young plants don't like a lot of fertilizer and we water with liquid fertilizer so you can get a potting mix with no fertilizer in it that's best I know a lot of gardeners like to put things in the bottom of their pots like River Rock or an upside down container of some kind to give a little air space and increase the drainage I don't do that when I plant into pots and I've always had good success I think the most important thing is good potting soil and a well-drained pot you should be fine so I'll fill this container to about six inches from the top I get it all evenly distributed and then I'm ready to put my rows in we'll add the rest of the soil once the plants are in place so the rows I'm planting today is Bordeaux it's a floribunda and it just came from the nursery when you receive your Rose in the mail it may be cut back shorter and Biddy foliated we do that intentionally we do foliate so that we make sure that your Rose is healthy and ready to go when it arrives in your yard and it's not stressed when it goes through the shipping process and then also we cut it back intentionally to promote branching and growth it's really important on these young plants to really push them to grow and to branch and to be well rounded and healthy so at the nursery we've done that several times and we do that again right before shipping so I'm gonna dig down just a little bit so this Rose sits nicely in here and just like planting all of our roses anywhere in the garden we're gonna go ahead and fill the soil up onto the Canes a little bit what that does is helps promote root development in the bottom and we'll get cane breaks that come out and really make a nice well-rounded plant so roses planted in this pot and we could proceed to the other parts of watering it in and taking care of it but before we do that I want to talk about companion plants I think a rose like this looks really good when you add companion plants around the base it gives a show of color that flows over the pot and really makes it look classy so if you're selecting companion plants for to go in underneath a rose it's really important to pick ones that will trail and cascade over the sides and I've done this with petunias before and they get a lot of growth and a lot of great color but what happened is the petunias start working their way up inside the rose and the Rose flourished and grew but the petunia did too and what I had is this mound of petunia and Rose together and it looked really good for awhile except that the petunias took over in the Rose to the roses detriment so I wouldn't recommend petunias pick something that's going to be less aggressive and will cascade over so one of the things I've been adding into my potted roses this year has been some white alyssum I've got blue containers around with roses in them and I like that white look trailing over the sides alyssum is pretty aggressive grower and will fill out nicely lobelia is another one and it's all personal preference at that point but for this pot I'm gonna actually use some sedum and I really like putting sedum in around the bottom of roses it will fill and grow over the top it's also a good way for to keep moisture in the pot it's gonna fill in around the base really well and it does great in in in warm climates I'm gonna turn it and then I'll put one on the backside as well so we have our plants all potted up here and the next step in the final step is to water this one of the most important things when watering is to also include a liquid fertilizer I liquid feed every time I water my plants in a container it just gives them everything they need to do well and it's a low level of nitrogen and other essentials that make that plant really healthy one of the most common mistakes we see with growing roses or any plants in containers is people using granular fertilizer granular fertilizer should never be used in containers granular fertilizer is too strong of a dose and will build-up salts and actually make the soil in the container toxic so don't use granular fertilizer we can't say that strongly enough don't use granular fertilizer whenever you're planting in containers always use a liquid fertilizer I'm a big fan of fish fertilizer I know it's kind of stinky but it works really well it's got all of the nitrogen that the plant needs plus a whole lot of other micronutrients and biologicals that enable this plan to have a really healthy great environment to grow in and it's gentle enough to use in containers so what we say is four pumps for watering can and give these new plants a big drink of water make sure that's well saturated you might need to do this several times while that wah oh this new potting soil takes up all this moisture so our one pound bag of mint compost has just the right amount of mint compost to top dress about two plants this mint compost is a byproduct of making mint oil from peppermint our neighboring farm has peppermint on it and this is part of the leftovers from the distillation process so it's all natural and a really great way to top dress your plants so you don't have to have a large garden to enjoy roses planting roses in containers like this with other companion plants is a great way to put some color on your patio and enjoy roses all summer long for more information on growing roses and to select the right roses for your containers

herb delta 8 thc cartridge now um all what delta 8 really is in a nutshell um is just it's simply a form of cannabinoid right and it still has a similar properties to thc and delta 9 and all that stuff and still delivers good effects you know it's not as strong as regular thc cartridge you get from your dispensary but you can still get really nice effects and it's uh we recently actually reviewed a delta three shy delta thc and those ones actually liked a lot they uh they have a seesaw cartridge hardware so they deliver really good hits and i was surprised with the high right but these are herb a and um taking a closer look i like the packaging a lot like this is pretty cool so it stands the whole time never falls down but i thought it was a c cell right and i realized once i like unscrewed it and everything it is not a c cell this is a it's ceramic coil so that's good but there's no improvements and there's no imprints on the anywhere around it and it's uh i don't know i could just tell the way until it wasn't a c still just by hitting it to be honest because the hardware is not that great it gives really light hits it's uh uh yeah like i said after hitting it i knew um you could tell right away because it just delivers really smooth really soft hits or really light soft hits but um as for the taste i mean the oil is really good it looks really good it's like doesn't move at all the taste is uh here we have two different strains we got chill indica and sweet sativa and uh sweet steve is actually lemon haze that's what i'm actually smoking right now it's uh the taste doesn't deliver that there the cartridge doesn't or this strain doesn't deliver that great flavor to be honest like it says it's lemon haze but i don't know i didn't hear i didn't really get that good of a taste it isn't really i don't know it just kind of takes a little harsh burn and just doesn't really deliver that great taste taste here i'll show you i'ma hit it right now and see show you guys all right yeah so i don't know if you saw that but this uh this cartridge delivers really soft hits and when i pull it when i pull to suck in like smoke it actually feels like i'm pulling kind of hard you know so i didn't like the hardware at all and the cartridge itself it doesn't taste good it tastes burnt to be honest it has a harsh flavor but it has a harsh taste but delta eight is a cannabinoid that is like known to be harsh itself the three-shot delta was pretty harsh but i still like the taste of it way better and they use they actually use sea salt hardware but and like i said the main thing with these cartridges is if they had you see some hardware that'd be so much better because um here's the challenger right it actually broke on me i uh pulled it out this didn't break here right i pulled it out and i already got most of the oil out and um i always hate taking out oil or replacing oil to another cartridge because you'll always lose some oil you'll always lose some oil regardless how good you are at it uh even if it's a little bit but still you know it's like who wants to lose oil you know but it didn't break from here i pulled that part out but right here is where it broke this piece came off i tried pushing it back in and just pushing it as hard as i can but it didn't work i didn't even push it that hard i just you know push it in to see if it would um fit back on and hit but no i didn't work it just i ended up replacing the oil to an actual sea salt cartridge you know and it did hit way better than this and the you know i can't really say anything about this flavor because uh it when i hit it in this thing well the heart was way better right and it still has leftover like flavors from the other cartridge that i had so it gave it tasted a lot more like that you know so but as in regards to the flavors to this strain it didn't deliver that great taste it was harsh it was uh it was just all right effects wise it still delivers good like pretty good effects right like you actually get a pretty nice again a nice uh nice eye right it's not nearly not the same as a regular thc cartridge but at the same time it's a the way i see it personally is like a high or it's like a strong cbd you know it's like strong cbd or a high quality cvd or they're like high quality bait pen that's the way i see it you know but it still delivers great effects uh similar to a regular high not nearly as strong as a cartridge but still nice you know great alternative if you don't have access to thc cartridges or you know if there's a lot of sketchy sketchy brands out there around your area this is a great alternative but this one these ones in particular i wasn't a huge fan of you know i much prefer the three shy delta a thc that one is still harsh right after if you take long hits but it's still i don't know i felt it to be more potent and it was a lot way more tasteful i uh i really hope this one tasted better but i'm not too sure like i said and the taste like just wasn't that good effects were not nearly as strong as the deltae thc but they were still there you know and like i said this is a great alternative if you uh prefer if you are if you're unsure of the cartridges that are around your area if they're pricey like here in illinois cartridges can go for half grams gold for like 60 and a full gram would go for like 80 to 120 you know and that's before taxes the these or maybe you're around an area where all you see sketchy carts are unsure cars that you're just unsure of you know in that case this is better delta a thc is federally legal and legal in most states they'll ship to you and it's just uh something pretty nice to check out if you're like maybe trying to switch up or like you know trying to want something uh reliable something something that trustworthy but more trustworthy than sketchy cards but yeah this is dave connection this is the herb delta athd cartridges and i hope you guys have a great day peace", "1ZeP68Ql1Rk": "[Music] hey guys mateo here and thanks so much for tuning in to this edition of let's be blunt with montana i'm so excited about the show today because i have a guest on who literally understands that one of the most important aspects of this entire cannabis journey in america is that uh is the aspect of education i mean education education education education it's important to this whole movement as you know location location location is to a real estate agent yet it seems like some of the industry has kind of left that behind thinking that it's more important to just you know educate us on b2b issues rather than b2c issues so that the consumer understands what they are trying to achieve when they reach out and attempt to use cannabis to for whatever their reason may be whether it be you know for personal use whether it be for medical use and i think like you've heard me say a million times and i'll say it again i don't believe that anybody enters a space of cannabis without some sort of underlying medical reason behind it they may not even be aware of it themselves they may not even want to recognize it as a medical reason themselves but even if it's to the point of just relaxing or it's the point of you know trying to expand you know their consciousness that is in me in my uh point of view is medical in some ways so you know i've taken exception to the fact that we try too hard to differentiate between what we're calling adult use or some people call recreational use and medical use i think it's all one of the same there are some people who just need a little bit more medicine you know i mean i i liken it to the idea of you know there is regular tylenol and there's extra strength tylenol there is uh you know regular advil and there's extra strength advil there are you know ways that you can you know suppress a migraine just by using oxygen some people have found that to be a really really really powerful tool others you know suppress it by using harder drugs um so again i think though at the end of the day what we're trying to do is achieve some sort of state that makes us feel better than we did before we started and to me that's medicine so for you know the average consumer out there who is trying their best to navigate this really almost impossible format for which we are selling cannabis right now today especially based on so much misinformation it's good to know that there's somebody out there like my guest today who is really you know let's call him a sommelier of cannabis he's a co-founder and president of the trichome institute a cannabis-based education company where he is an explorer and a lover of all things nature and all things that nature has to offer maxwell uh mantras please welcome thank you so much for being a part of let's be blind with montana day sir hey thanks for having me really excited to be here absolutely i'm excited to have you too because you know it's it's important that people understand you know the nuance in cannabis and not just you know what seems to be you know especially being portrayed by the industry you know what they think the underlying reasons are for cannabis so i'm glad that you've done it so let's just back up a little bit let's take why don't you take us on your journey with cannabis when did your journey with cannabis start you know um i was self-medicating uh without really realizing it when i was really young and i actually exchanged cannabis for pharmaceuticals for pain for paying attention anxiety sleep all sorts of things but um something that you might find interesting is my very first medical marijuana patient that i was licensed to take care of in colorado was a gentleman with ms and you would walk into the dispensary um uh in not your normal format i mean you could tell this guy was hurting in a variety of different ways and what actually kind of inspired me to create the trichome institute was how he was being treated in the dispensary and that's actually why i took it upon myself to take care of him personally because i was just so disappointed in this is back in 2009 so this is before cannabis regulation this is before uh legalization in colorado this was a while ago um this was before we had child proof packaging or even lap testing okay um and you know i was told to stop talking to this guy stop telling him all these things stop giving him all this information just sell a sack of weed and move on and that was difficult for me to do because i was a medical marijuana patient myself and this guy needed help and he wasn't getting it at the time and wasn't getting it from the ideology of it's either indica or sativa when obviously it's neither um and he had a really interesting need for cannabis that seemingly only i could understand which was how to be sure that he was going to get a stimulating varietal and not a sedative and for whatever reason his ms required the uh what we call nlm the narrow leaf marijuana type that's what he needed and strain names couldn't get him there you couldn't just trust that this blue dream would be a stimulant when there's so many types of blue dream because uh it's a black market product there's not consistency in the naming and so um it was almost kind of the inspiration that started the cannabis uh someone yay in tarpon and so we use the same methodology that i was using 12 years ago teaching patients at the dispensary that now we've created into a full-blown course a multi-level course with books tools um all sorts of really interesting stuff to explain the complexity of cannabis the most dynamic drug on the planet without a doubt and you know it's interesting glad you you gave a little bit of a history i mean but you started using yourself not i will again not say recreationally but you started using in the black market in high school before high school junior high school when yeah um actually believe it or not if i'm being honest with you actually first started uh using it middle school um and all uh i also think that that's probably too young for most people to start with cannabis you know i was exposed to really poor quality cannabis at a young age called schwag and i started learning more and more about cannabis finding different unique variety types that affected me in different ways and really started analyzing how and why which varieties would affect me in certain ways and that's actually what kind of transformed me from smoking cannabis just for fun into hey this is the medicine this is helping me sleep this is helping me pay attention in school this stuff is helping me but it's dynamic and so to better understand a complex and dynamic substance such as cannabis has been my life's mission and i really love sharing uh the the depth that we've discovered with it because when you can control your own cannabis experience the way that carpenting helps people do you're in more control you can get more medicine out of it because you take all the guessing out the guessing that's required with the industry standards strain names indica sativa thc percentages we just take out all of those equations because those equip those things don't really make sense right they don't really matter again this is part of the problem i think that's been in this industry for a long time like you you know i started my journey my real journey with cannabis back in 2000 so you know when i was first diagnosed with ms there was no information and so i had to dig deep i had to try myself back in 2000 thinking there was no way remember there was no internet so you're looking for you know copies of peer-reviewed published documents from around the world that were hard to get a hold of hard to find hard to interpret but i was able to get a lot of information really back in 2000 long like yourself long before this became the vogue you know green rush and everybody decided to jump aboard and really only stick their toes in but don't stick their whole foot in and i learned very early on that you know all the nomenclature that was being used in a lot of the dispensaries especially in california at the time that was probably the only place that you could literally go up in northern high you know in san francisco in oakland bay area to find a dispensary that actually could sell legally you know um i remember my first journey uh out there trying to look for what this doctor said i heard about this kind of cannabis that this kind of marijuana that cb something see something i don't know what it is and i remember growing up in northern california and literally asking a question about higher laden cbd plants and literally had a grower and a person who owns you know in one of the top stores in the oakland bay in the bay area um say look i got this canvas that came up it's way high in cbd and i don't want it if you want it i'll give you all of it and i was like are you kidding me it's again back before people even understood what you were talking about when you're talking about you know just cannabinoids and and now all of a sudden we're in a place now where people are starting to understand that the terpenes the flavonoids the fats lipids all that is just as important to is one of the constituents of the plants are just important you know people are now starting to get it at least at least opening up their mind to a better interpretation what did you study in college uh sociology just because um i had to make my jewish parents happy by going to college but i didn't want to because i uh i knew i was going to have a different path but you know sociology is important because there's nothing in the world that you can engage in outside of nature itself without um involving people and so learning about people and their cultures was important for me um and you know i started mike the college i went to as a conservative catholic school where i was dispensing cannabis across the street uh and again before regulation so we were smoking in the dispensary so i'd come to class every day uh soaking in it which was uh quite the experience but um have you ever had a good advertising board too right have you ever seen a weed wheel uh i've seen a variant of it so instead of saying indica sativa instead of having hc or cbd percentages which do matter but we have a this process where um if you need to know how to find a type of cannabis that affects you in certain ways cannabis is on a spectrum from five effect types that you can actually smell for in different parts of your face and so um if we have a broad leaf marijuana varietal that you would smell certain smells with certain inflorescence characteristics that you actually feel the vibrations of the terpenes whether they're stimulating or sedative within their totality you can actually sense within the trigeminal nerve of your face and so if we go down to a broadleaf marijuana type people can understand that in a physical perspective you might get couch lock mentally it's comfortable your focus is zoned out your mood is carefree the risk is no productivity the activity is sleep or lounge and how much that will affect you is going to dependent on your personal tolerance level as well and so i just wanted to share with you that this is kind of our solution for getting around strain names into core sativa and even thc percentages because like you mentioned we're discovering that the terpenes have a lot more to do with how cannabis affects people from the effect type perspective um maybe a little bit more so than some of your more better known cannabinoids yeah well you know i mean i think we when you say better known cannabinoids we're barely scratching the surface on cannabinoids right now we understand and know that it's pure there's peer-reviewed you know published documents around the world from canada and from israel and from you know now colombia and other places around the world that there's some people claiming they've identified up to 160 cannabinoids so therefore we haven't done the research on all those yet most people in america right now are just now starting to understand there's something called cbg they didn't even know what that was you know most people didn't know there was cbn they don't know what that is they don't know what cbd that really does they don't really understand the difference between thc cbdc and you know it's gotten to the point where you know we have a lot of people who just like to throw out a lot of nomenclature uh to sound as if they know what they're talking about but not necessarily understand it and interpret it the right way but you described yourself as a naturalistic learner and that's based on the fact that you were you know studied i guess i i used it as that time study but you you you went to a lot of private schools when you were growing up did you not yeah i did um i graduated from a public school uh george washington um but due to my learning uh differences my really severe add dyslexia psychomotor agitation i did go to private schools that were helpful for me for that kind of stuff uh and so it that's kind of now again at the same time as you're going to private these these private facilities that are trying to determine to help you figure out what was going on you were still using cannabis right um that was around the time that i was really juggling adderall for canvas think about this adderall is an amphetamine salt ritalin is methylphenidate and when you're a kid and you're given these substances they're not to medicate a debilitating condition it's for scholastic performance enhancement and most people don't know that and the result when you give a child a supplement that is amphetamine-based or meth-based like adderall and ritalin is the side effects are you can't eat you can't sleep and you have a really nasty mood you can you can be triggered very easily there's chemical reasons for that whereas some of these really interesting varietals that i was using when i was young island sweet skunk golden goat these really uh more pure narrow leaf types they helped me focus the same way that adderall would but their side effects were i could eat i could sleep and i was generally in a good mood and so i made that decision on my own when i was a kid um that i have something here to help me and it it's more helpful to me than the stuff that society thinks i should be taking and so even though society thinks that cannabis is wrong i know that it's right um so i'm going to use it and i did well well i think when you say that society i think that we're just looking at one society and that's mostly in the united states that decided to attack this plant not for any reasons other than racist you know uh uh non uh just racist financial reasons um so you know what's that i was gonna say you know um uh the the means in which um they were so effective in their propaganda campaign against cannabis was racism without a doubt it was people don't understand you know if we look back in 1937 people don't even understand it the person who led the charge was the ansler you know who was funded by william randolph hurst and charles dupont this was done intentionally to help continue to propagate the destruction of the big trees in america and also to shift over to textiles people don't get that and then the only way you could do that was to blame this thing on somebody so you had to blame it that's the reason why they came up with the word marijuana marijuana based on a mexican prostitute term so you know do you mind if i um teach you a couple things sure so um uh we agree that the uh the methodology the methodology in which they were successful in their propaganda campaign against cannabis was racism um and uh i've actually trained william randolph hearst granddaughter she's an interpreting certified person uh who i'm friends with and um a lot of people don't understand that it was really more for financial reasons that cannabis threatened oil big oil that's right 34 was not only developing biodegradable cars out of cannabis but running them on cannabis oil and dupont uh chemicals william randolph her paper who lost uh to uh ponchovia a mexican and who was you know a hemp propagator which combated with paper but also um tobacco alcohol and pharmaceuticals cannabis threatens all of the major big ones right big tobacco big pharma big big alcohol and a lot of people believe that the word marijuana was created for these racist purposes and it wasn't created for these racist purposes it was used for those racist purposes primarily only between 1920 and 1940 but what a lot of people don't know is the 500 year old etymology of the word marijuana which derives um what you can find in the 1846 pharmacopoeia mexicana mexican pharmacopoeia which actually shows you the etymology which is so interesting that um when the spanish inquisition took away indigenous religious plant types entheogens to native um mexicans that they actually introduced cannabis and told them to grow it for hemp purposes because they the spanish needed it for uh kanavos canvas for their sales correct rope yeah we go back we'll remember this country here in the united states back at the founding fathers in the original 13 stage you were required to grow hemp you know all of our forefathers grew hemp when we recently you know scraped the the pipe of benjamin franklin's that had been sitting on his desk for 30 years at the smithsonian institute they scraped it out and realized that benjamin franklin was smoking some hemp he wasn't just smoking tobacco homeboy was getting the buzz every day if you wanted to most likely jesus too because if you actually look if you look in the torah the recipe for the anointing oil requires kind of awesome which we know is cannabis and that was just corroborated by scientists who discovered the cannabinoids uh and the old altars of the old temples in jerusalem very recently i've been talking about that for years and i always made the statement if it was good enough for jesus why isn't it good enough for me um the the word marijuana that i wanted to tell you though was the the indigenous people tricked the spanish inquisition by saying that they've now named the cannabis plant which they started using for entheogenic purposes when they weren't legally allowed to as the plant of mother mary this is christ's mom's plant this is mariguana santa maria and the word marijuana is a derivative of calling the plant something to relate it to christianity to allow the christian inquisition to allow the native and indigenous people to actually keep cannabis during their cannabis prohibition which is why uh viva la palabra marijuana right like long live the word marijuana for the mexican people in their indigenous terminology that they used it for and how shameful it was that a lot of white guys in the 1930s tried to flip that around and they were successful at it but still to this day in mexico the word marijuana is not a bad word and um it's it's it's actually a really interesting it has a really interesting history and so um we've been more open-minded to the word marijuana but i'll be honest i told people for over 10 years you're not even allowed to say the m word because i thought the word in and of itself was racist until i decided maybe that's me perpetuating racism instead of allowing the beauty of the word to be what it is and to embrace it and it's in its indigenous history it's a 500 year old indigenous mexican word it's awesome and when you look at the fact that you know anselinger who was during prohibition for alcohol was in favor of cannabis use a lot of people don't know that they think that he always but when he lost his job when they decided to go ahead and bring alcohol back and allow that to be used all of a sudden we had to find something else that he could attack and he jumped on that bandwagon and you know for the rest of his life didn't and tried his best to do everything he could to outlaw hemp around the world hence you know the 62 61 62 u.n trading that banned hemp you know uh 1972 csa act controlled substance act uh nixon yeah in the states right yeah but was it 6162 that it was banned by the u.n i know that the controlled substance act of 1972 which was nixon uh which again was actually used for more racist reasons than not it was to break up with people who were coming together in the 1960s against uh nixon his administration war it was hippies and we know from his tapes you can literally hear him in the oval office say uh how are we going to combat these these people that are coming together and it was to bust them over cannabis and it was to make an enemy number one which is you know how shameful is it that still to this day federally cannabis is schedule one which means it provides no medical benefit has the highest potential for addiction and the highest potential for overdose death even though the u.s government has recognized medical marijuana and has pharmaceutically been producing it longer than i've been from the alive 50 years 50 years plus 10 years in mississippi you know that first program that was started under daddy bush you're right so a lot of people don't recognize don't take the time and again that's what's so important about the what we're talking about is that education education education the more knowledge we have you know the better we are suited to be able to understand why this should be available to anyone in this country who needs it now you you literally you know have a you kind of let's go back a little bit again because i want to kind of start with where you made that transition was when you got out of college that you decided i'm going to go ahead and open up the university or oh no well high school is when i high school was when i said enough with pharmaceuticals it's cannabis and it was high school when i became an activist um and i've got some wild activism stories um and yeah yes yes you were a sign carrion you know cannabis oh man uh when fox news um fox news got me stoned on on tv and put me through what years what year was this well i mean listen i started marching in the street with signs in 2006 2007 uh with actually the guys who legalized cannabis um way later so uh vicente cedarburg and vicente was running sensible colorado and i mean i was a high schooler uh running in the streets with protest signs um uh ever since then and then you know started progressing and becoming more of a professional i started working in legislation policy um i started going to the meetings i started going to our state capitol i mean i've probably donated three to 400 hours of my time um making sure that this was going to become acceptable for people to engage in in colorado but well colorado you know i had an office in colorado and downtown denver back when roy rohmann was your governor and i also hosted one of the first the mayor yeah the mayoral um election i think it was 2002 2000 it was 2004. i literally hosted uh the segment on the debate on cannabis there in downtown denver um back when norm early was your district attorney and and i was a very very instrumental i i spent a lot of time in colorado i had an office there and then i ended up moving my office to california when i started my show but um yeah colorado was you know like california one of the leaders so so this is 2006 for you you were out protesting in the streets and then you decided when you went to college you went to college of course in colorado and then after graduating is that when you decided to open up and found the track home institute it was it was during college when i was tired of the misinformation um being that wasn't helping people in in the cannabis industry you know the idea these plants are this strain name it's not i did a video i've got on youtube where i went secret shopping for blue dream in denver colorado and i got six different types of flowers all called blue dream uh from licensed legal dispensaries for medical patients in under one hour and we demonstrate how and why the plant types are different from each other and why the black market ideology is so problematic and today why the current lab testing is not helpful um which we can definitely get into if you want to um but it was it was around college that i started working in the dispensaries and i started caring for patients and i started to really see that this industry is happening but it's not going to happen well if we keep the black market ideology moving forward and the cannabis industry today has really embraced uh the kind of stuff that i would experience in people's mom's basements you know like blue dream dude 32 thc it's like it's it's not about that um it's it's more complex than that and getting into that complexity is really where the magic is that's that's where cannabis you can really start to take control of your cannabis absolutely absolutely especially you know and then those who are seeking to you know find relief for whatever their individual ailments may be um you know if they were to know more about the plant this way they could make better decisions when they're out going in navigating some of these dispensaries around this country and it's only getting worse it's not getting better that's the thing that really shocks me is that you know as new states come on online the new states practice the same bad propaganda that was taught 15 years ago thinking that they found something new well where we actually have some unbelievable uh very expensive sophisticated technologies that we're excited to come out with to combat this this this bs that you and i are talking about right now we're developing uh we're partnering with some really incredible industry members with some technologies that are mind-blowing uh to combat a lot of the problems that the cannabis industry is moving forward with that you're talking about which is strain names uh basic coas and thc percentages and this is all really terpene dependent and so you were discussing that we were just scratching the surface of you know cannabinoids which is true but um you know the typically the highest terpene count that is provided is around 42 terpene types the guys that we're working with built a terpene supercomputer where they can actually analyze the aromatics which have an effect type on you in a three-dimensional gas chromatography process so we're actually looking at the smell of cannabis and the totality of it three-dimensionally and in color and they're reading over 400 terpene types in some singular samples of cannabis and so with our ability to actually see and feel and smell the chemistry that is actually there we can reverse engineer how cannabis works we can grade it uh with our human self not a machine in the lab process and we can develop apps that say hey you've got ms awesome uh what kind of cannabis works good for you and your ms what type of variety of cannabis from an effect type perspective and and we will help teach you about that on this application too but at the end of the day most apps that will show you where cannabis is is based on strain names or basic coa lab testing which are not really accurate and so we care enough about cannabis to move forward with some really uh complex work in the background so that people in the foreground don't have to think about it all you have to do is pull out your cell phone scan a jar of cannabis and then look and see oh out of the five effect types this is going to be the most stimulating or slightly stimulating or in between or slightly sedative or the most sedative cannabis is not indica or sativa it's neither of those two it's all domesticated hybrid plant types between a narrow leaf broadleaf spectrum between a stimulating diseditive spectrum and and that's only marijuana then we get into hemp and now a whole new ball game which is cannabis so we're actually starting to offer hemp as the trichome institute to teach people how to gauge their cannabis quality because we teach people how to dissect their flower um to see if it's even ripe your lab test won't tell you if it's ripe your lab test doesn't tell you if there's bugs on it or not and get this uh legislatively mandated lab testing that looks for microbials looks for the types of microbes that are on food such as salmonella and e coli and they do not look for the molds that are common for cannabis such as petritocenaria or powdery mildew it's like we're done we're done with the industry like just it's all the government guys who think they know how to do it better than the guys who have been growing the ganja like two or three generations it's like we we've gotta make a bridge and we're gonna be technical we're gonna be scientific but we gotta dig deeper we gotta this plant is too dynamic and offers too much to only be testing for a couple cannabids and maybe a dozen or two terpenes absolutely and i agree with you one million percent but unfortunately we're in an industry where you know again we circular we i say this industry you know um pays more attention to b to b than they do b to c meaning you know we're too busy trying to make sure we stay one step ahead of our competition rather than enlightening our consumer to let them know what they should be looking for and that alone would keep you ahead of the competition if you were able to do that that's what we're doing we actually we don't care too much about what other businesses and companies are doing because that's their business and um we care about people we care about the plant you care about education but unfortunately unfortunately you're gonna have to get some of those other businesses on board so that they stop putting out the false information so that people will even be readily you know uh optimistic about hearing from you you know what i mean i do know what you mean and we're actually going to give those businesses who want to do cannabis the right way an opportunity in a technology to differentiate themselves from the rest of their competitors by actually instead of saying indica sativa using different terminology that's a little bit more accurate but in a little bit more of a simple way too um it's it's complex to understand from the background but the point is is we understand that problem that you're talking about we are working on it and when the technology is available how could how could the industry not embrace pointing people in a better direction to the cannabis that they're looking for and how it's going to affect them more accurately um it's only a matter of time well you know they've been thinking about that since if you've got like your slight crystal ball on but when you say it's only a matter of time you take a look at what's going on nationally i mean we look back at november 6. you know cannabis one forget about who won the presidential election cannabis won five new states you know passing for five five states passing new legislation yet since the date there has been as much pushback in those same number of states as there has been the people who have been sharing the fact that it was passed look at the south dakota where they're trying to now write legislation to undo the will of the people look at new jersey where they've tried their best to slow down the process of even answering and you know uh standing up for what the people voted for so i find it it's it's almost like you know again you know we're living in a time where we've got a president a brand new president who says we're going to follow the science but this brand new president is still living off of science from 30 years ago cannabis is a gateway drug chef you know i mean i want to say shut that you know what up and we got a vice president who you know during her tenure as uh you know uh a.g made sure that there were as many people or more people color arrested during her for four years than than previously and after so you know um we take two steps forward to take 10 steps back and if you had to use your crystal ball how many more years of steps do we have to take before we finally reach you know an understanding that there's nothing wrong with this plant you know what's funny is uh i'm actually the centerfold in a penthouse magazine for my cannabis crystal ball because i've been predicting the cannabis future for 10 years and nothing that i've predicted has ever failed it's really crazy there's so we have an article of me predicting the future um that came out a couple years ago and everything that i said has slowly become real which is um both good positive and negative um so from like a negative perspective i predicted and i'm telling you you're going to see less and less belly style meaning your human ability to go to a dispensary and see the flower and smell it and decide that that's what's right for you the way that you do with your fruits and your vegetables or any of your other groceries is going to go away and that happened i also predicted that medical marijuana dispensaries will become illegal and slowly but surely that's happening so you know washington state had an incredible medical marijuana program gone now it's retail cannabis and that state took away people's ability to engage their flower and see if it was right for them now it's all pre-packaged and now california just went that way and so that's why these technologies that we're building that are going to tell you how cannabis will affect you um in a really really dynamic way and be able to grade it for people from a quality perspective from a cannabis someone yay perspective interpreting methodology is going to become more and more important as medical marijuana will be going away more and it will start to transform into pharmaceuticals now you see epidiolex which is phytocannabidiol which is pharmaceutical even though it's still a schedule one drug meaning cannabis doesn't provide a medical benefit so you are still being lied to by your federal government and people are still being thrown in jail because of it and nothing about that is cool but texas has medical marijuana dispensaries they have an incredible hemp industry the trichome institute just judged can uh texas's very first cannabis competition ever just a couple months ago um i can't believe that virginia is not only medicalizing um people that i know there have medical marijuana cards they're buying legitimate cannabis from virginia but now virginia's going legal i can't believe oklahoma just next door not only has a medical industry but it's prolific the the domino effect is happening um and if states are smart what they'll do is they'll look at the colorado statistics of okay how many people are getting hurt versus how much crime is going down because of cannabis how much uh opiate use is going down because of cannabis wherever dispensaries pop up crime and opiate use decline you can just see it statistically and then what about jobs what about revenue what about taxes we're building hospitals in schools out of a hundred million extra dollars a year from our cannabis industry we're helping society whether that society likes it or not and we're really proud of that i mean we you know we we as an industry so we're really proud of we as an industry are proud of that however there seems to now be this push back a foot just like this push back against global warming there's pushback effect look at here in florida here in florida where i'm coming from you know they're trying their best to enforce a cap um an arbitrary cap on the amount of thc because they're trying not to hurt or help the patient they're trying to hurt the industry by forcing you to have to buy much more thinking that you need more because of the numbers and i can i have often said this and i talked about it yesterday on a podcast i remember you know in the early 70s in the you know late 60s and early 70s i don't think you could probably have found back then you know a cannabis plant that had you know a higher percentage of 11 thc and it was fairly it was really good cannabis as a matter of fact i remember some experiences with that in my younger years where you know i think i've never found anything to quite match it even until the day so but but the fact that you've got you know uh this arbitrary number that you know the state of florida wants to come up with to cap the amount of thc they want to try to roll back some of the dispensaries that are providing cannabis remember when they first passed down there they wanted you to only be able to to uh use cannabis um by using it as a pository way so you have all these strain which is okay but at the same time you know it's not the only way that it can be effective so you know uh again i still think we take three steps two steps forward and ten steps back but go ahead um the war on drugs as you know montel is a war on people absolutely we the people are the ones responsible for fighting back and uh some of us warriors are infantry some of us are gunners and you know some of us are the stealth bomber pilots and we're dropping bombs dude we're not giving up we're fighting this fight and we're winning because at the end of the day more and more states are opening up and of course there's going to be confusion of course there's going to be battles of course there's going to be soccer moms who think this guy's going to fall out uh when a dispensary opens up you know down the street and of course they're going to combat it and of course it's still going to be a fight and of course we're still fighting it but we are winning more two steps than it is one step back um it is a matter of time it's moving forward more than it's not um it's more psychedelics i mean right at all you you have legal uh mdma that is pharmaceutically produced by the fda for the ptsd trials coming out of maps in colorado you can legally engage in ayahuasca and peyote with certain license types we just we're the first city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms as well as cannabis and you're starting to see that in other places new jersey um santa cruz uh all of oregon just most recently um we the people are fighting intel and we're not giving up and we're winning well you know i'm from your mouth to god's ears because at the same time you say we're winning we still see a lot of arrests especially of people of color who are losing uh when you look at this industry across the board we look at an industry that was born on the backs of people of color 80 of the arrests since 1937 were against people of color and when you take a look at the industry that has less than one percent people of color being invited to the table yeah you know winning is is all in the eye of the beholder uh but yeah i think you're right at least we are taking i again i i feel like until we can you know again look we just we got a new administration and they've been there now for three months one of the things they kept saying near the end of their campaign was that this would be addressed in the first hundred days well a hundred days is almost over and they haven't addressed it and are they afraid to because they think it just might be that one thing that sets off the same people who were busting into the capital you know there's conversations being held in news reports about the fact that the capital reeked of cannabis hmm you know what did you see the did you see that one uh i guess you could call him insurrectionist who uh in the dome of the capital lit one up this big and just was puffing it real tough i think what that goes to show you is one of my favorite things about cannabis which is it is for everyone and so from your snoop dog to your uh willie nelson from your liberal to your conservative from your black to your white from your rich to your poor people who understand campus who have taken the time to learn about it and overcome the misinformation embraced it and as richard nixon was so terrified of it does bring people together and you're 100 right i mean this i studied cannabis as a sociologist it was the only thing i studied in school as a sociologist kind of my protest for having to go to school but i mean as a sociologist studying campus i researched relentlessly how and why people of color are arrested at three times the rate it's it's unfair and it's true and it's also true that the cannabis industry doesn't have a whole lot of people of color in it um and that's not okay uh it's also why we've done anything and everything we can to support a lot of our education and certification that helps get people jobs um into some programs so that uh certain people have uh easier access to it we care about that we want to we want to uplift that that community too um it's it's a war on people and if we the people don't come together and fight it together let's just say we need to uh and do more and anything we can do to support that we're all in well i can tell you max thanks so much for being a part of let's be blunt with montel i'll tell you we definitely have to have you back because i want to have you know some more discussions with you especially about some of the other plants that you are doing research on right i want you to explain some of that you're doing some research on again you went through so psilocybin ayahuasca uh a lot of the psychedelics where a lot of people now are in a lot of you know mainstream medicine and starting to recognize its efficaciousness yep absolutely well i'd love to be back um yeah let's talk about peyote in ayahuasca next time and uh in hemp and how awesome hemp is especially as a medical cannabis product um but i really appreciate being blunt with you montel i appreciate being on your show so um i'd love to be back and uh and chat more so thank you so much absolutely we will definitely have you back and i want to make sure you guys make sure you tune in and make sure you wait because i'm telling you uh you've been schooling us well max

linkin park hybrid story and some of the other bands he's been involved with and as we say here in montreal bonjour jeff come on how are you muy bien yeah muy bien yeah that's right uh we're in southern california um i'm doing great glad to be here and uh i should grab the book and show it do you have to show like you know the whole yeah individual hold on one second if you see my dog in the background then you know he's the most important guy but because there's those home gamers this is the book it's called one step closer and uh yeah details the story of uh how hybrid theory the album came to be in the biggest selling debut album the 21st century to give it a shameless plug but yeah yeah and and that's what i want to i want to get into and i also want to talk about some of the other bands you've been involved with including macy gray including dj ashbah and beautiful creatures uh it's an interesting arc so so let me get into this uh talk to me just about the book first in terms of the story you wanted to tell it does detail the story a lot about linkin park a lot about hybrid theory um talking about how your story tells through that how does it play out through that the telling of that other story well the whole the whole story starts uh about when i lectured at ucla and it kind of goes back from there and then forward so i uh i was teaching at ucla while i was working at this company a publishing company called zomba music publishing and uh i had just signed a woman named macy gray who nobody liked she had been passed on by every record label her publisher dropped her manager dropped her et cetera and i was looking for an intern at ucla because that is where i had actually discovered what a r was and nr for those people at home uh is uh artisan repertoire and we are blessed with the job to go out and discover new artists and potentially develop them and that's what i like to do so i the book starts about me lecturing at ucla looking for an intern and this young kid named brad delson uh you know the reason he said he actually liked the macy gray demo he was like the only kid there he was his rock kid and i was playing neo-soul and and the kid literally showed up in my office i thought unannounced because i don't remember scheduling a meeting with them but it was in my office uh super confident a bordering on arrogance which i liked and um literally told me that he he had a band that was gonna be bigger than the bands on my wall which at the time were matchbox 20 corn and limp biscuit and i was go i just got like i don't like this kid you know confident but he got rejected like 40 times so yeah i i i signed you know i hired him as my intern and then a few weeks later he threw a demo tape on my at my desk and it was his band zero which wasn't that great and uh you know it goes the whole process i i ended up going to see his band the first show they ever played and it was at the whiskey and they were opened up for his uh system of down and and sx10 uh send dogs banned from cyprus hill and i was just like man i like this kid and they need a lot of work but i signed their band after the first show they ever played which is amazing so so talk to me about about being an anr guy because what do you see in a band and i was talking to the papa roach guys yesterday and i was telling them you know what i used to work at metal hammer and i got your your your infest album and right off the bat first play i went that's a star band and you you could just tell that they were at this other level but for you as an anr guy you know for me as a as a rock critic it's easy it sounds great you know what are you looking for where you go okay this band is gonna be at this level i mean is it look is it is it is it confidence is it the songs because you know there are some bands that have great careers but they don't really have great songs but they sell themselves really [ __ ] well so right what are you looking for well first of all um uh jacoby is in and their story's in my book too because they came to my office as a music publisher looking for a development deal which is what i was doing with this band called zero at the time which became hybrid theory which became lincoln park let me just ask you real quick did you tell jacoby lose the trombone player was that you no that was not me um but uh jacobi was helped me you know writing the book and we talked a lot about it and when i was doing all the research but uh you know as a publisher i was looking for artists to develop because by the time they were assigned to a record label it was too expensive to acquire their publishing publishing and a r are and record labels are completely different just for people at home publishing is something where you uh the company owns the copyrights the record label owns the masters and then and then usually the 360 included all the you know touring and whatnot um so i was working as a publisher at doing a r discovering artist and no matter what even as a record person or publisher i always look for uh something that's iconic and that could be a guitar tone it doesn't have to be vocals but it's 95 vocals so an iconic sounding vocal i also worked with this guy daniel powder from canada who had had a bad day and had this really quirky vocal may segregate as a quirky vocal jonathan davis has an identifiable voice fred durst uh does you know these are different artists i've worked with and um and obviously when i found chester i immediately found that he had a beautiful iconic voice so i look for an iconic sound whether it's you know a guitar tone drum sound anything like that that immediately you can identify as oh that is this or that artist and i'm sure there's a million of those such as queen comes to mind metallica um steven tyler oh yeah there's just anybody that can come to mind their identity um so authenticity meaning literally you speak your truth uh there's a vulnerability in you that that is believable that you are you are literally connecting with somebody on a different level um and you just don't sound like you're trying to do every other band you know be every other artist out there that's the trend of the moment star power the ability to connect on stage but actually engage somebody in general um you know there's a lot of very boring people out there that don't connect great talent um and i've dealt with some people in that that is an issue uh it's that urgency that you get when you you're engaged with somebody or somebody who's on stage uh then of course hit songs and you know i delve into that a lot as a songwriter myself i'm very very hyper aware of every second of every song being utilized to its maximum and hooks and making those hooks grab you uh and then i gotta say by the way i love your thinking because sometimes you hear these 12-minute songs and you go ugh really can we just get to the chorus and don't bore us please right well if you listen to the the hybrid theory record that's 38 minutes long and i i was insane about going hey this is unnecessary this bridge is on us here let's cut you know cut the core of the uh intros down until you know there's certain iconic you know like uh in the end you know exactly you know that's immediately that piano line that's iconic you know mike shinoda was great at that but every second was utilized and then of course a great artist allows you to feel like you belong and that's the ability for them to connect and you know that is what chester did so so well you know god rest his soul that guy literally even in person may you made you feel like he was right his lyrics and his emotive behavior his performance was connecting with you and they're like oh my god i feel that same way yeah and that's what i look for in an artist that's what you look for in an artist and just real quick and i don't want to spend too much time on it but you mentioned publishing these days merca mercurius and and primary wave are buying pretty much everything a good for primary wave by the way um what do you think of that now that that publishing is starting to get into the sort of two or three hands urban a's off is also buying a lot i mean publishing is becoming like just three principal owners in a sense good bad i mean it's good for the artists right they're cashing in sort of kind of uh it all depends i mean again you don't have to do a publishing deal i always looked at publishing the way i did it was uh as helping an artist not just as a bank um but merck is a super hyper intelligent guy um i am right when i was in zomba years and years and years ago wanted to buy catalogs and they didn't want to do it i brought in a lot of cool stuff like ah that's not going to use that much and uh you know so i agree with that there's catalogs are extremely valuable there are iconic songs that can you know a lot of the income comes in from film and tv placement so you know why not it's your music you should be able to do you know publishers generally work to exploit your catalog which should be done and i've worked with a lot of publishers that really didn't do much um so you know good for that yeah absolutely i think it's great uh in terms of of the helping the artist uh back to the to the bands that you helped set up how do you differentiate in terms of genre because going from macy gray to limp biscuit to to lincoln park i mean it's not the same audience it's not the same market it's not the same thing so so how do you go macy's got something lincoln park got something why not just be like the hair guy and say all right i need five rats let's go yeah not at all um i love music so as a kid uh you know i was and this goes back years and years ago i was bussed into uh los angeles schools and so on the bus ride i was listening to van halen zeppelin ac dc um pretty much that was it you know and then i was in school and i was listening to grandmaster flash uh and uh michael jackson and uh you know it was very diverse group that i was interacting with and so immediately from my my youth you know my my parents would only listen to barry manuel and neil diamond so i loved it all you know i love disco uh hard rock soft rock you know some country from the time so i was exposed to everything and i didn't go oh that's not cool i thought everything was cool you know so um i have the ability like in any given day up to this day i will listen to uh certain times of day hits from the 70s because i love those old you know pop songs when i'm working out i listen to hard rock and new stuff one of my best friends is in this band grandson uh jordan's just incredible vocalist grandson and uh then i'll listen to r b and chillista hip-hop in the evening so uh and i also listen to country you know depending on my mood when i'm running in the canyon i'll listen to that a lot so uh i have always had the ability one of my favorite artists was uh nina simone and billy holliday so uh that was my chill stuff and that's when i got to be introspective and so when i heard macy gray you know i was signing all these rock bands and i heard macy's voice i'm like that that is an iconic voice i just lost my [ __ ] i was like i've got to work with her and nobody wanted to work with her i had actually tracked her down and convince her to get back into the music business she was done with it so i'm extremely passionate and and super into music and when i hear something that that excites me i there's no stopping so that's why i've always been that guy looking for new artists i don't care if they've had 10 million followers that you know if they have two followers there's a great voice there and they're talented i want to know about them and that's why i get so many artists coming to you know work with me and you know help build their careers and i've gotten so many artist deals yeah and and that's refreshing to me by the way because you know i'm known for the rock stuff but every so often on twitter i'll say hey you know the duran duran's something people go oh you can't talk about them they're not rock and i'm like who cares i love them they got great songs you know well the deal the deal is this man is that uh any song is a song it's a pop song doesn't mean it's pop if you break down any type of song and it's good you can do it in any flavor of any ways any genre and that makes that makes a great song that's when you know you've got something great if you can play it acoustically and break it down and then put you know different elements behind it that is a great song um like when the lincoln park guys they listened to depeche mode but also i was working for jive records which was the publishing company zomba and they were listening to all the backstreet boys stuff and they realized those songs were incredibly well structured you know you could make one of those you know any of those songs super hard put heavy guitars behind it it's still going to be a damn good song so i agree i i agree so so let me get into lincoln park for a little bit because i remember at the time you know listen i was all into the deaf leopard and to the scorpions and all that and and we had that downwards curve and then nirvana and all this and then linking park comes out and it's one of the first times we have two vocalists or two guys trading and that was unique and at first i sort of went what the is that and a lot of people said that but you went with it and of course it worked uh talk to me about that did you ever sit them down and say listen get one vocalist you need your steven tyler you need your whatever or were you like nope we're going to create something new here the irony is there's two ironic situations in that uh i always thought it was very unique yet we showcased 44 times and we're told 44 times the band sucks they don't have hit songs there's no star there and everybody said it sounds like everything else there's this is you're late to the party now i'm like this doesn't sound like anything i know there's two guys here two front men that are amazing and for the people that don't know there was an original singer before so i had you know that was another big in insanely tough thing where i had to replace the original vocalist because he just wasn't cutting it great guy super talented and ended up becoming an amazing manager for artists like tap root and system um but you to me that was that was an iconic thing and it had to blend so those two elements really needed to blend really well um and then ironically when i finally get this band signed as part of my employment deal to go to warner brothers the by the time i got out of my contract to go to actually physically be at warner brothers the guy who hired me was let go and the new boss that came in had already passed on the band uh three different times three separate showcases passed on the band so now he's our our guy in charge at the label and he made that suggestion he goes just have just have chester get rid of the rapper and so we went through that and it's detailed in agonizing traumatic detail in the book and uh it was extremely difficult on me knowing that mike shinoda is the guy that really was the impetus and the creative structure behind that band um chester was and is one of the most beautiful impacted voices of our you know the last 30 years but you cannot have linkin park without the the dual aspect of that you know hard-hitting transition between you know the rap the singing and the you know the vocals and the melodies and um so yeah i did have to deal with that with uh lincoln park and we stood by it and you know mike in there but it was a very difficult process one went to this day which you know it was very traumatic for for him and listen i i started doing this this reporting stuff in 96 and i remember people going no it's never going to work what are they thinking it's like well they proved you wrong didn't they yeah it worked pretty darn good uh let me just ask you you went over to warner's and uh you know around the end of the 90s early 2000s you start developing this band beautiful creatures with with dj ashbal um talk to me a little bit about the thinking behind that because you had of course uh you know a lead singer from a from an 80s band you had these different bit players and you were sort of like reinventing the wheel sort of saying hey you know what def leppard fans we've got a band for you um what was the sort of the thinking behind beautiful creatures and why did it sort of just peter out after doing the oz fest and stuff well there's a reason for everything um so i liked the band a lot i actually liked joe uh and his band bang tango um yeah i was in there because of dj dj ashba and he was just he was an absolute star the guys in the band were all really strong as the guy kenny queens um and i did think there was there was room and there was a need for guitars because at that time uh in 2000 2001 uh right it was not cool to have any guitars totally stripped out of big music okay big no-no no guitar solos everything's steering away from guitars and i know everything is cyclical so i meet dj and i'm like this this guy is incredible he's charismatic he's great he just he makes you feel like you belong and he's an insane guitar player so um that is a life lesson where dj was the strength of the band the only part of the uh the equation that wasn't great was he was the strongest point in the band which you don't want to have your guitar player be stronger than the vocalist and um you know we got a lot of flack uh on the vocalist uh i thought the album was great you know it was one of the first things that i i also uh co-produced that and i had a lot of songs i wrote on that record a lot and i thought there was some really great songs um the head the new head after the other guy who didn't like lincoln park the guy who came in uh hated the band beautiful creatures and basically dropped him so he did drop him well he didn't draw no because it was interesting because i was doing interviews back then and they'd say you can't ask about bantango it doesn't exist just just ask about beautiful creatures and i'm like so you're trying to hide the fat and it was just very strange and anyway i saw them at ostes they were great the album the two albums were great but yeah they were trying to sort of cover up the fact that there was an 80s or something yeah there was a big stigma attached it was like it made him seem old that was the thing that made him seem old and uh he really wasn't that'll anyways long story short yeah the band got dropped it was four books i worked really hard on that and i still talked to dj all the time um he's super talented and he went on obviously to play with guns and roses molly crew uh he's just a phenomenal guy so um yeah you know you can the thing that people don't understand is they think it's all up to you know me all the decisions are coming to me i my job as an anr person is to nurture facilitate get that record going through and finish the record make it help market it and put the vision out there so the world can hear it but there's always people above you no matter what there's always a ceo and one guy above that guy if they don't like it for some reason or they don't like the sound or the one of the guys in the band which is the case in this situation um there's not much you can do and of course it's a lot of politics unfortunately so now that's why artists will come to me and i will help develop and go hey this is how you also avoid these roadblocks and i learned a lot about that in writing the book again which we will plug right here yes one step closer wherever your books and everything sold uh so yeah it goes into all that it goes the book discusses what it takes to persevere because you will hit roadblocks all the time you know you'll hate gatekeepers as i like to call them the wonderful gatekeepers yeah and we don't know everything all the time you know i'd like uh there's plenty of things that that i one of my faults is i'm always early oh too early like lincoln park i was three years early machine gun kelly i brought to atlantic records a year before anybody even heard his name and they passed you know i brought in nickelback the first show they ever played in the back of a record store in vancouver and they wanted to do a deal for you know 4 000 bucks so many different artists um i like finding stuff early so in the position i have now where i can solve for labels but i also develop i'm able to have that time because record labels are not going to develop you they're going to assign you based on your fan base your your uh social metrics it's horrible so um there's a lot of different ways where artists can facilitate and expand their career you know whether it's just playlists and knowing the right people or film and television so i'm you know i'm also doing a soundtrack right now soundtracks have been essential in breaking artists i did uh there's an artist i had that was a pop artist that the guys lived with me and i got them they were called uh the last good night we had a number one song in nine countries and it all stemmed from a tv show um but you know we want a bmi award out here and uh daniel powder was broken by a television show um you know lots of different artists you know the fray but long story short there's a lot of different ways to uh step up your career outside of just you know having great you know absolutely i'll keep reminding folks that one step closer is available now now you just mentioned nickelback and and i'm a canadian and they get a lot of hate i happen to think they're great i think when when you see them play live they can't be touched i mean they're they're just spectacular live um just out of curiosity why do you think they have that reputation and ultimately isn't that just good pr because they're always being talked about uh it's not the best i mean just like you know limp bizkit also gets a lot of hate and i think they're freaking great i mean i love i love chad you know chad and i joke all around he he almost did a publishing deal with me for 4 000 bucks my my boss is the one who didn't want to do a 4 000 deal with this unknown band so um no i think he has an iconic sound to be sometimes artists become a parody of themselves you know that sound everybody emulated at the you know the marbles in your mouth he was the first guy i i honestly don't know why but yeah they had some incredible songs and i think one of the things is they kept and with all due respect chad you kept basically reproducing the same song the same formula but that works for a ton of different artists you know ac dc 50 years yeah i mean for the most part you know um but uh and then same thing with limp biscuit people just decided hey you know that was you know they were they were everywhere when you're everywhere people start to hate them it's just uh it's ridiculous i've seen limp bizkit live and they're great too so dude fred is freaking amazing i still talk to dj lethal all the time uh you know he helped me with the book man i don't know it's just people you know people love to hate this there's more haters than you know people who actually go out and support you and that's one of the things you have to also learn about this business that you're getting into if you're a musician and i do talk about it in the book uh is that there's always somebody out there ready to hate you know it's people love to throw shade and people love to tell you why you're not good you need to actually find your strengths focus on them have the belief in yourself listen to those haters because there are there always is the modicum like one iota of one percent truth behind everybody's comment but follow your own vision take everybody's comment and analyze it go hey you know what maybe they're right about something and that is what we did with lincoln park at a point enough people said hey look that vocalist isn't you know isn't hitting it and so we decided to actually get rid of the lead vocalist which is the most important part of a band and wait and by a miracle i found chester you know in arizona uh while i was at drinking at the four seasons hotel in south by southwest and it was a random occurrence i just called up this guy without ever hearing his voice and you know said hey man we have this killer band called zero from los angeles they're about to blow up you know and he told me it was his birthday and i'm like oh that's great i go you know you should leave your birthday and go record this demo tape and this kid did it and his name was chester bennington and you know he changed a lot of people's lives all over the world so um you know end of the day you've just got to make your mark you've got to have that drive any artist and anybody doing anything any type of career you have to have that drive because that is what's going to propel you past all those haters and uh and really make your statement in your career and you have to hold strong to your vision and when i say listen to the haters i only say that in that one instance where somebody will is objective and maybe they are right about something and maybe that little change will be the catalyst for everything that makes you know all the pieces fit together with your project yeah absolutely uh on that i'll remind the folks one step closer fascinating read i i just i thought it was compelling and uh there we go jeff blue thank you sir and thank you for contributing to it to the music that makes our lives better i mean you know oh man thank you very much you know thank you to all the artists out there who who just follow their passion and their truth because that that's how i do it you know i'm a musician myself and you know a songwriter and i you know i started as a journalist and that is what enabled me to really help analyze and communicate with people breaking music down into a a language you know that you can communicate with and and guide and it's it's such a rewarding thing to find artists who you you can have that relationship with and engage with and create something special so i'm just i i love my life and i'm glad to be here and i look forward i actually just found an artist through the book who reached out to me and uh said it changed her life and i listened to her music and it was incredible wow and we're in the process of uh making an album for uh yeah bring us the next macy we need more oh no this girl is like billy eilish meets eminem oh well my daughter will love that and by the way my daughter loves billy eilish and machine gun kelly so you've done well why did you i didn't i didn't get to sign either one but yeah i did bring them or it brought in machine gun kelly but yeah man well thank you so much so yeah and then you you shout out the social shows like if people want to reach me uh you can reach me at jeffbluemusic on instagram it's probably the best way uh all my other socials and i've got the website over here jeffbluemusic.com as well and i'm changing that over right now it's uh uh century park entertainment that's c-e-n-t-u-r-y park entertainment uh dot com but it's century park and dot com merci beaucoup as we say in montreal thank you so much all right sounds great let me stop the recording", "hX2yT-hEF28": "Well, here we are in the cookies, cookies, cookies, and cookies aisle of, uh, our local supermarket and, uh, the reason we're here is I want to show you guys exactly what you shouldn't be eating- I like you. -Evan snorts- I like you! This you really shouldn't eat. -static- What's going on, internet? This is Vinnie Everyman and today we're going to talk about dreams and how junk food can actually affect your dreams. Alright, so, basically what we have here: Chips Ahoy, uhh, Nutter Butters, all that kind of stuff. Um. Eh- Newtons, actually not so bad, but eehh, not really my favourite- Oreos. Boy, that's fun. Um. I know these are awesome and they're delicious, but you really gotta watch out. You really shouldn't be eating this. There's a lot of other snack foods that you can eat and aren't horrible for you. We're going to show you that next. Alright, so, here's our first example of actually good food that is, uhh, good for ya, and actually tastes pretty good. So here we go. We got a different assortment of nuts, uhm, dried fruit like pineapple, mango, uhh, cranberries, cherries, apricots, all kinds of stuff here. Now, what you can do with all this- can make a real nice trail mix. And, uh, basically, you have a lot o' good foods in one little thing that's not only good for you, but it- it's like... funny- like you know how you're sittin' in front of the TV, you don't necessarily want to eat something, you just kinda wanna nosh on chips and stuff. Bam! You got trail mix. That's a better... substitute, as you could say. Plus, we got all kinds of things over here. Cookies, uhh, chips, all kinds of crap. Uhhm. That doesn't look very good, -Jeff laughs- but all this stuff. You know what I mean? H-hit this stuff up instead- instead of the horrible... saturated fat crap that you guys eat in the... chips aisle. Try this stuff out. Now, be careful. Just 'cause it says 'natural' doesn't mean that you should just go crazy with it and just eat as much as you want, alright? It's still food, it'll still make you fat if you eat a shitload of it, so watch yourself. But, keep this stuff in mind. So, unbeknownst to a lot of people, um, food actually has a great impact on... not only your- your physical health, but also your sleep habits. And, uh, dreams, for that matter. Like, take for example, you eat this huge, awesome, greasy pizza covered in... all kinds of meat and deliciousness. Um, and after you eat it, you go straight to bed. Horrible idea. Because not only do you wake up later, y'know, with a horrible stomachache, but you also probably have some weird... weird-ass dreams which won't help you sleep at all. Umm... uh- this happens mostly 'cause I think your body's a little bit freaked out at what you just ate. But, yeah, so you wanna try to stay away from junk foods, and- and bad foods right before you go to sleep 'cause it never- it's never a very good combo. Now, also, on the... the topic of dreams, not only food, but also stress, outside sources.... Pretty much anything can affect what you dream about. Like, just last week, I had midterms and I was stressing out so much that I had dreams that I was running through the woods in my old elementary school and it felt like something was following me. Y'know, that could've been a manifestation of the stress I was feeling at school. It could've been a lot of things. So, not only do you have to worry about the foods, but also try to keep yourself... as stress-free as possible before you hit the sack every night. What about you, man? You have any recurring dreams lately? ...What? Nevermind. -static-", "iqAdYjqtDKA": "hey all here os reviews today we're taking a closer look at two unique cases for samsung galaxy smartphones the first one here on the left is what's called a magnetic tempered glass case and it actually includes a rear and a front panel both of which are made out of glass and the sides here are made out of aluminum and clips together using magnets claims to still work with wireless chargers and of course because of the glass material you can still see the beautiful finish of your phone and it still retains the overall premium feel of the phone because of the glass and aluminum construction you can find versions for every single popular samsung galaxy smartphone including the notes and the regular s line and another version which can be found for a few dollars more also has a privacy glass finish on the front so if people are looking at the display from the side they won't be able to see anything in terms of the second case that you see on the right what makes it unique is it has a transparent segment on the case which is a folio design that still allows you to see basic notifications in order to activate this secondary notification panel this case also comes with a compatible application that you can download and once it's installed it will be compatible with this particular cases smart wake function although the design isn't as striking as the other magnetic glass case i still like the idea that it's a case that also includes a software component that comes bundled with it immediate first impressions is it definitely feels very solid because of the aluminum rail and the glass that's being used here there's also a protective film on the front which you can kind of make out has a cutout for the earpiece and then on the rear there's also a sticker with cutouts for the camera lens helps you understand which direction is up and which direction is down so they've cut out a few pockets to help the antenna still pass through this metal surface in terms of opening it up simply applying a bit of force it just pops open and you can see this is what it looks like basically it's just held together using these magnets it is a pretty strong magnet it won't really pop open during regular usage but it kind of locks into place but otherwise the assembly is super easy and again the magnets make it just very simple to kind of pop in the phone now this sample case here is using a galaxy s8 but again it's compatible with any newer galaxy phone as well taking a closer look at the design of the case now in the rear again we still have the beautiful finish of the glass which is exposed which looks great there's a slight kind of seam which is the part that adheses the glass onto the metal bumper but otherwise the camera lens of course is completely flush the fingerprint scanner is a bit more recessed but overall it's still easy enough i'd say to press on the seal is pretty good in the sense that it doesn't really wobble or kind of move around inside of it this is what it looks like from the various sides the buttons themselves are very tactile and responsive it's still quite clicky then here it is on the front we also have kind of curved edges just like most amps on galaxy phones it needs to conform to that curved design the camera here is covered up the front-facing one underneath the glass along with the earpiece here it does have a cutout otherwise in terms of the responsiveness everything is still fully functional i can still interact with the phone overall without too many issues what i will say though is sometimes you do need to press a little bit harder towards the middle section of the phone in order to get it to register so if you tap really lightly sometimes it doesn't completely pull in but overall not too big of a deal another option is you can go into settings on your phone and turn on the higher sensitivity mode for the touch screen aka the glove mode so it becomes more conductive to your touch tempered glass screen protectors are always going to be tricky on phones like this which have a curved screen because the edges are just harder to adhese onto and makes it tougher than on flat screens as far as protectors are concerned so overall for something that's curved and built into a case i think it's doing a pretty good job as far as retaining the functionality of the device is concerned as you can see there as we're kind of pushing along the different sides so from a basic functionality as well as aesthetic perspective this is a great case but there's definitely still a few downsides to it for instance the fact that a the overall level of protection is still not going to be as high as the traditional maybe bumper case the reason being that this is made still out of glass so if you kind of drop it on the ground you just have more glass which the first layer here will probably shatter and you have to replace it is a tempered material which means if it breaks it will still stick together and it won't really fall into different shards and just like traditional tempered glass protectors chances are it's going to prevent the internal screen of the phone itself from breaking the impact will be absorbed by the case itself but still if you drop it you'll see again some more tear as well as damage to it compared to a fully kind of rubber case which is more resistant and as far as wireless charging is concerned indeed it works without any interference so if we pop on top you can see it turns blue and it's going to operate at normal speeds when we remove it from the case it will stop charging the second unique case which is this folio design that has this transparent window opening it up is where you have a little barcode scanner that you can download the compatible app in the play store but it has a nice amount of protection in terms of a cover that prevents the screen from getting scratched otherwise sides of the case are constructed out of a rubber material which feels pretty solid and you can further unlock the phone like this it's held into place using magnets to have it in the kickstand mode if you want to watch videos with it it's like almost a fabric material to it so it is very soft and grippy the camera lens is a bit more recessed than i think what's normal attaches into the rubber bumper here really without any problems fits quite well it's a very tight seal and looks quite cute and attractive doesn't add too much bulk to the phone overall one thing i will say immediately is the folio case component i wish had a magnet that would lock it into place a little bit more it still sits well enough if you just put it into a pocket or something like that but if you hold it upside down you can see that the bottom portion here will just flip open this is what it looks like for the camera part it is again kind of recessed and the magnetic kickstand portion does work quite well so as you can see there we can set it up at various angles just tilting it back to still interact and watch videos without holding it with our hands in order to unlock the features for the smart cover you have to download their compatible app you have the ability to toggle on or off various notifications such as calls contacts and battery information just by tapping on those controls and you can turn on or off the cover function by tapping on that key and once it's on the proximity sensor of the phone will also be activated once you close the cover like a book you can see it pops into this notification shade mode shows you that time information before going to sleep and when you open up the lid the phone itself will also pop onto life so it uses the ambient light sensor for detecting that component and actually works pretty well the auto on or off function so no real complaints there it's nicely integrated the app though could still use some refinement such as the function called theme i'm not really sure that's corresponding to if you tap on theme all it says is do please respect which doesn't really make sense so hopefully they can push out a software update to this app which can further increase its functionality in terms of changing things like the style of the clock and adding some more customizable colors that people might be interested in one thing to note here is if you don't have the app activated or turned on you can see that the window here will not be functional so that is more or less it as far as this video which quickly documents two unique phone cases which have been getting a bit more popular recently for samsung galaxy devices and overall they're definitely two slightly more interesting phone cases than what we typically see so if interested you can check out more details in the links down below but for now that's been our video thanks for watching here os reviews that's been a closer look at two unique phone cases one with glass and magnets and another one with a smart cover", "IC4QnmMg3IE": "i feel like we've got to be more visual now that it's being filmed whoa we're being filmed i mean actually to the to the people watching this go do something better with your lives you can listen to podcasts while being productive and doing other things if you're watching a podcast even if you haven't wow they're giving us money so we should i was literally just saying you guys have given us money so yeah they've given us money for other benefits this is like the lowest this is a pound a pound and you get a video well you know even they get better stuff with a pound they get the dis the discord's worth more than that like this is dog [ __ ] oh now people just see that we just have to sit here oh that's that was really low i'm going to play that again [Music] i'll do um nice well now you can see exactly how things go how badly this is where we've been podcasting for the last like three or four oh god it'll be more than four months well i don't know but in that time we've done about three or four podcasts yeah we haven't done much but everyone that we have done since moving in here has obviously been like on our new setup as well ethan's one for example he was on this screen and we were like hi ethan and he was like hi poor ethan he was ill he wasn't no it wasn't he was just quiet ethan's a chill dude um i'm just a mellow dude dude dude marx is here yeah hello breaking covered but we're in an office and you're allowed to be in an office we're playing and we are working and the patreon's released this is what this is all about yeah actually in all seriousness to the people watching this thank you very much because you are the first of hopefully many people to support this this changing landscape of which we're going to explain more and answer some questions that came in on instagram and just generally chat [ __ ] because that's what we do and if you're not watching this and you can't afford to fork out a pound but you probably spend a pound on like like yeah the other day i went to the shop i bought a picnic chocolate bar i haven't had one of those actually a lie pound 15 or is it actually actually that's probably like 75 p i really remember sometimes they're like but then i got another chocolate bar as well because i'm a [ __ ] gluttonous turd for well i spent over a quid on chocolate yeah there you go i could have spent a quid and be watching this so they could so basically the audience could become healthier by not spending a pound on chocolate and stuff and they can corrupt their minds instead one less stellar one let's start you can't get a stella for a pack you probably can actually yeah somewhere what the beers can you get for a pound remember there was those beers 50 pvs from tesco's beers and they were [ __ ] strong as well they're like six percent yeah ordered way too much of this beer and in all stores around the uk you could just find 50p beer for two quid you'd get four very high now it was wicked two pounds anyway so to answer the first question callum uh messaged very shortly after things went live let me read out the exact quote um he said i've lost it here we go he said uh so in short you've got an office you can't afford and you've made a patreon to help pay for it oh yeah there we go podcast over no um it was really funny actually is that we i guess we didn't consider doing the patreon where initially we were thinking join but we didn't really consider that until the office was going ahead but very quickly we knew we wanted to do it because so taking it all the way back to before we did it we need like a rewind sound effect so taking it back all those voice messages sorry the audio oh yeah that you heard in the in the welcome video or the introduction video at the start were not planned they were all voice messages that giles had sent me before we'd even committed to this space at all so some of them were before we even knew about this potentially knew about this location because we were still looking and also it was it didn't feel like we could it was just kind of something we wanted to do and then the right opportunity came up with the right place like i've looked at spaces over the years and sort of wanted to do things but but yeah like what was really cool is when we're doing the welcome video sam uh this guy called sam white who he's not sort of in the parkour community but he seems to know a load of us um incredibly talented filmmaker and he helped shoot kind of the the one shot and we had some crazy lights set up for that you'll see we'll release like a behind the scenes of that um and on the patreon as well yeah and he basically did a ton on the edit because i just feel like i've lost my creative editing knack and what i've seen it felt more like a 50 50 of you and sam did more hours but he did more like impactful bits but he was like we need it to feel motus and then it was like why don't you use the voice messages because you always communicate with voice messages which i think some people know me to do that and it probably pisses them off but whatever uh so we dug back to voice messages i sent to you sam few other people and like compiled this like cool narrative it was sick it was really cool to hear them anyway and there's way more as well yeah there were so many that they were just the ones we chose but it really made me realize what actually happened like we but we just didn't have this space yeah beforehand if we were ever working on anything especially if i wanted to get involved i was going over to giles's tiny office in the top of his house yeah which we know watching out yeah so if you think about motus until now has always been in a little bedroom basically yeah which makes sense because we're not a [ __ ] huge brand it makes sense but it's just so cool how far we've come from that and then now we have this yes yeah you know um but yeah where do we where do we go oh that's what i was going to say is like so we're not we're not doing the patreon to [ __ ] afford the rent or anything but we when we realized that this was going to go ahead we were like well we've always wanted to do a join or a patreon or something where you have a kind of oh yeah an exclusive exclusivity or whatever and therefore having a somewhat kind of separate entity of the brand because it star obviously do like an extra video but we can barely scrape out a video anyway yeah well we had that we were thinking because it was join up for a while yeah we'll do youtube join because you get the join thing next to it on youtube it makes yeah he's like oh we've got the subs but and we knew patreon existed but we didn't really see the benefit on having it on another website but yeah it just seems join kind of just mixes up videos like that basically we we wouldn't be able to release polls we wouldn't be able to yeah join join is just a video feed yeah like you can't do anyway it was obvious i don't know if i'm going too far down the list now but while she sleeps released their patreon yeah yeah and immediately but i was just going to say before that so like the reason we wanted to do this because there was such an obvious split that we could basically say yeah like we'll obviously share some stuff from here on instagram stories and it'll crop up in videos and things but what we're going to create in this space is much more the behind the scenes of the brand and therefore it isn't like we've already had comments on the youtube video of people saying like oh not for me i just want to watch parkour and he's like that's absolutely fine this is for those people who want to sort of really show their support and also get that extra glimpse yeah and it was so easy like oh if we get an office we can immediately kind of put a line down the middle and say like one is the workshop and one is like public training whatever but yeah then no that makes sense because we did release one video where we i can't remember what actually happened behind the brand what happened is at the start of last year we went yeah we're gonna give all our stock to fulfillment and then within a year we went down like that yeah and then did this yeah but but yeah sleeps while she sleeps incredible band and also incredibly diy and everything yes while we were like we'd already actually moved into the previous space to this yes if you watch the behind the scenes videos on the patreon there's like this weird story where we were meant to move in here and then there was a delay uh and we we ended up in a different office for a couple of weeks just a temporary office which is literally it's literally way bigger than this as well but it's just not really right corporate yeah um and yeah we were we were already filming and getting everything ready and we were fully like going down the like pretty set on join and then sleeps came out with our patreon and it was like oh and we suddenly realized how much more depth you could get in patreon and yeah varied content and exactly so we were just like we basically carried on doing the same thing but said okay well we can actually widen our yeah it helped because we're just producing video content anyway we weren't thinking about all these other things that we could be doing yeah and i mean we've obviously done sort of like they they to anyone with eagle eyes they've they've done a certificate which like a physical certificate and we've done a physical certificate because i we we signed up to it basically to get the experience and it is really nice to actually have a you pay a five or whatever and you get a physical thing so we just actually finished posting off that batch today the first batch and their their purpose for their patreon anyway was actually to inspire and to get other people to do similar things to them well it's like the shirt they did they sold a shirt like last year that was like 20 it was it was basically the same price as something like 20 000 spotify streams oh really and all it says on it is like the average sort of spotify play out is like 25 quid for 20 000 streams or something which is this many hours like to actually pay a band significant amount of money through listening on spotify is almost impossible yeah so they were like this shirt is basically that equivalent and it is so much more impactful for you to purchase that but they made that template and gave it out for free you can go on their website and download it and just use it for your brand oh so they just made it open source so other bands can use it yeah to generate money basically yeah which is sick so like taking inspiration from that we realize we can kind of use this space not only to create content for ourselves and to show you guys what happens here but hopefully to give you information about what happens behind a brand not like we kind of know charles knows what he's doing but no i don't i was gonna say kind of look at that photo up there the [ __ ] brand from the outside and then brands from the inside that is but if you're thinking about starting up a brand or just anything like that hopefully this will help and now we have the patreon setup and the discord you know and feel free to speak to us whenever if you need help with anything and also now you guys can get more involved with what we actually make here so well i think the simple truth is is that we technically don't know what we're doing this whole thing is as everyone you just make it the same way say with live no one no you kind of make it up as you go along like we're learning every more and more every day yeah what we're going to try and do through the patreon is like basically try and be as transparent as possible bar sort of the obvious personal finance yes yeah like we're going to try and share as much as possible creative processes failures etc etc because you guys are supporting us through through paying for it and also like i don't know it's it's a weird one because i've always been scared of sharing i feel like i've been alright at it in the past but it's so it's so good to create those connections with people when you fully just like go transparent and kind of share your journey yeah and and we do also want to potentially kind of scale the patreon to more content or more tears that become slightly more educational um it's not yeah it's not set in stone at the moment but it's um yeah because i know we've got planning to do a video with jordan or he's getting one filmed about photography and photography within parkour and stuff so that should help anyone out he's yeah he's a photographer but also just things like that yeah yeah the tutorial but so i guess that's sort of getting ahead a bit but like the i mean we should run through everything that we've got going on here because really we try to make this like you mean right now the hybrid space what do you mean oh you mean the hot the whole space yeah yeah but i think what like would be good to sort of clarify because you can only say so much in the welcome video and we really try to get the message across but also like well you've got to get the message across you've got to get the vibe right so and also like it's interviews too so in the interviews i'm all stern like i'd like to grow the brand and the lights were dying and it was like running out of time and it was like oh my god um but i think like the grand vision for this place is like this is like stage one and hopefully we can scale this exponentially is and the brand obviously um is that it's very [ __ ] hard to make it as professional athlete in parkour straight up like incredibly hard this is not going to change the game for everyone but it's like what we can do with a so so we're going to be producing more stuff in the house we've had some questions about that that we'll go on to in a bit and we've moved our fulfillment in-house because we were paying a company to do that and although they did a very good job you're paying extra fees essentially to pay for someone else to do it you lose some of the control in terms of what you can put into your packaging et cetera et cetera and given that we had this space we're trying to make it this hybrid creative space it was like okay we may as well bring the fulfillment back because we're still going to be making stuff in factories specifically trousers shorts outerwear etc etc but we'll be doing more smaller more limited runs of kind of your standard t-shirts hoodies etc etc that we're producing decorating everything in-house um currently we're using kind of heat press equipment we're we're moving into dtg hopefully quite soon embroidery something i'd love to do but that would require someone we'd have to basically employ someone to do that because it's this is awesome because we can see in i don't know in the future that hopefully we can basically take control of nearly all of our clothing things with embroidery as well and just getting more people in to join the team that are that's that's what i wanted necessarily athletes but just people to work here alongside us i want to make they're passionate about growing yeah the mission is to make motus and sort of the workshop so to speak the best place to work working environment because if you are in parkour and you love the community and you love the sport but you can't live as a professional athlete because you don't have what it takes or or whatever but you're a sick creative or you have interest in like blah blah or even if you just want to [ __ ] work in the warehouse and pack orders like we have just to throw it out there we're not that big yet like we can't employ tens of thousands of staff and blah blah blah but the goal is that we can we can scale this model and create a working environment that is entirely true to the culture of parkour and we're always we've built downstairs specifically so it has a training set up and that's going to develop over the next couple of weeks we had to kind of rush the mezz in and we've got vault blocks and things like this but like my dream office which is basically what we've created in us in the smallest version is a place that encompasses all the creative aspects of the brand plus a training setup because we live in england and weather [ __ ] and and and it's sick and we can employ all our friends and we can provide careers for people who want to work within the parkour space and this is exactly early days of all of this but this is the direction that we want to take the brand so that kind of hopefully explains that and i'm sure we're going to [ __ ] it up a thousand times on the way yeah it's exciting it's really good to get to see that that's the thing it's not trying to hide the process and the reason we're looking out yeah and the other thing for the patreon is like you guys are supporting that so directly because buying a t-shirt there's there's obviously like profit on that t-shirt but there's the cost price of the t-shirt and things like this whereas you even like people giving a quid patreon take fee so it's actually like 72 p or something but that is essentially 100 profit so just speak so like let's say a thousand people gave a quit that's a thousand pounds extra each month that's coming into the company to support that like that's a wage for someone so it's your support basically can make a massive difference so if you haven't signed up and that has compelled you then you know [ __ ] getting your credit card out get your mum's credit no i can't say that no no no um but yeah i'm [ __ ] excited yeah i'm scared because there's a lot of things that we've got to like get our heads around and we've been trying things aren't finished yet yeah yeah we still have planned me i mean today me and marx were trying to set up the twitch stream so there's things like that because we the downstairs we'll do a full video on the mez when it's completely it's so sick the amount of stuff in here but you i mean hopefully you guys have seen what the space looks like from all the stuff that's out there now but with the mez downstairs and we've got the chill out area right on top and we've got an xbox up there obviously mark marx has just donated his [ __ ] tv he's he brought his xbox here crash games we've got a very big crash very big crash match map like stop taking stuff please we've got uh technically three bars yeah we've got we okay let's let's run through it okay so downstairs we have basically a hybrid room that contains all of our sort of uh factory-made stock um so like at the moment it's kind of the most persistent collection uh packing area there's also a weird like camera under stairs it's like a bat cave of camera gear oh yeah yeah that's hidden away that's still a little bit messy but we need to sort out um and then we have the the sort of the the rubber floor which doubles up as like a training floor yeah where we we've got precision trainers a vault block well uh the volvo vault block and the precision trainers you welded them they're they're currently in my dad's workshop they're coming but that will be on the floor yeah that'll be on the floor but it fits nicely into the corner we've got a photo studio backdrop hung up with different roles yeah which basically rolls out covering the training floor so yeah so it could be a training floor or it could be a studio or whatever because basically we can then make stuff in-house and then immediately shoot it so we can kind of contain the whole creative process um obviously if we want to go out and shoot on the street then we do that but for product photography and stuff and also we can kind of unofficially we're not win we can't under the sort of terms of our lease we can't like rent it out as in like oh yeah can't pay us money and things but but we'd like to offer it up well that's the thing if friends want to come and use it like i don't know fifth unit for example have some products they want to come and shoot like we can almost certainly make that happen um and then so what we then built above the stock room because we basically have these ridiculously high ceilings down there is a giant mezzanine which we kind of just i can't remember what it was we were just like oh [ __ ] we should just make a mess yeah because we realized that's weird actually because that wasn't because toby suggested it from the tumblr dwells gym yeah but that i can't remember how early that was in not early at all it was while we were in here yeah because we realized that there's stock downstairs there's a training area but there was just quite a few bits left over that we had to keep moving out the way yeah and it was like well if we made a mess we've doubled our floor spots and we weren't even thinking like let's make a mess so we can have a sofa set up up there but then when that just came along yeah that just makes the whole vibe so different so yeah so above that basically i i built this thing with my dad who's a metal worker um and he he was like i will help you but you have to take on the bulk of the work because he was building this insane tower at his farm his dad has done so much for this oh he's helped out so much like it's the type of thing where he's like you have to do the lion's share and then he ends up helping me so much but um but from nearly all of the particles i want the floor on the top that we were making yeah oh you mean no no no yeah the concrete floor yeah yeah my dad has the the brain to make that stuff because i i just did the the manual imagine trying to find someone to build a mezz oh we were looking at quotes and it was thousands and also the precision trainers and the the parkour block that you were welding the other day yeah to get metal like that and to be able to do it yourself with the like the creative it's freedom so helpful um but yeah so we built that and and weird stuff was happening like we were gonna build a ladder up the side of it so we can climb on top and then my dad's mate who's a scrap man turned up and he had these two like giant curvy bars from a playground he was like you want these and we're like yeah so we've now got this sick bar that like yeah it goes up the side of the ladder we've got different lache bars that can be attached in different places two huge bits like two wood yeah two big plywood walls which basically they're not screwed on right now but we're gonna attach them modify them cut notches in them for dinos and climb ups and descent yeah um basically the bar thing with the we could do the hull five roll back oh yeah there's like a yeah yeah it's like we just tried to make the kind of space it's a small space but it kind of covers all the little fundamental bits that you need i think for movement exactly because in the winter we can just like yeah it just doubles up as well for yeah for us creating content not only for the patreon as well but for youtube or anything it's now nice we have just we've got a space to yeah you know exactly confirm that we can do things and then above that there's the mez which has like general storage because if we're using the photo studio we need to throw the crash mount things up there but slowly we've built out this like essentially it's a gaming setup like it's sofas and bean bags and tv yeah and it's going to get better as well yeah and then also behind that i've slowly over the years collected because i'm just a bit of a park or nerd like an archive of parkour clothing collections that mean a lot pieces that mean a lot to me so i've got like farangs leather jackets like kind of classic pieces like that plus some random ones that are thrown in there yeah and they're all like [ __ ] covered in plastic on a clothing rail like protected it looks sick up there though it's my parkhive which is my parkour archive but with the gaming setup we haven't worked out properly yet but we potentially will be like maybe streaming every friday but yeah propose but just something to maybe get excited for but not just gaming training as well just are we leaking the name what gaming and training oh it's leaked yeah it's gone well mark's just randomly said the other day gaming and training maybe like we should just call the twitch channel that because it's gaming and training that's that uh and then yeah upstairs is kind of the more it's the warmer room yeah it is it does get quite cold downstairs yeah um oh actually we should speak about the stairs because we're slowly covering every single surface of the walls in like epic parkour photography mm-hmm who have we got so far stuff from noah north street boogie yeah uh casey jack dodds um we've got like kieran's gym uh poster up there we've got the pkdgen stick what's he called i can't remember the man the what is it called not epic stink what the [ __ ] he called what is it i love it magnificent stick i don't know it's literally down those stairs but anyway um we've got like the stora shirt from rca that we've got we've got the first ever motor shirt made that's framed got a bit of the dame delac in a frame yeah my phone with david bell like stuff like that jump britain tickets then we've got max's like imax kong pre huge banner on the wall which is sick so like i'm i just i want it so it feels like anyone who's within the sport can come in and feel very much like we're like capturing a kind of element of the culture and i've also got in that box actually uh a load of [ __ ] i love them photos from andy day who's uh called keel well his his kind of phone name was kiel he's basically the og original photographer of the uf and things so some of those photos are like some of the first photos taken of uh is it parkour in london yeah like parkour in london basically like the first ever jams and just like guys who just kind of have no idea what they're doing just jumping over rails and on climbing on walls and things and i used to love those photos when i was a little kid it's like i've captured that and he's he's printed them [ __ ] like nice paper and things so they'll go up that's so wicked and then yeah like i just whenever i see somebody with like a print or something i'm definitely keen to try and snatch you up yeah so if you have anything you think would fit this yeah area for sure because we want to try and fill that out i've got this massive sticker on the wall for the podcast so would you so you're cutting your we should have known and and got him to do two or at least have it so i could slide off my hair yeah like a sticker attachment or something yeah choose some tip x that's a [ __ ] lot of tvx yeah um but yeah upstairs is like basically the it's it's we have kind of an editing bay for myself and keelan and then anyone else who wants to come in we've got this giant table that i got facebook from what 80 quid i think it was 50 quid table and chairs that was the first thing i bought for this place yeah just shoved it in the office it's sick it's the center piece of the whole thing pretty much where we're sitting right now for the podcast yeah um little kitchen little toilet you know other things like that but then stuff the other half of the room is kind of what we have named the workshop so to speak which is basically a production line of from sort of blank t-shirt to decorated and bagged and tagged and ready to go shirt or hoodie or whatever it feels really nice being able to take control over that stuff yeah and i mean we totally want to expand it as well because the the cool thing about like i mean screen screen printing is straight up on art and it's never going to die but there's definitely a kind of rising tide of if people don't know i mean i wasn't aware of what screen printing actually was until you showed me yeah this is great screen printing is you literally have to use you look up on youtube screen printing and just watch the process of it you will understand why it's so [ __ ] hard and why it's an art but you can get like i mean obviously we we've paid loads of different companies to screen print for us and we'll probably con we've actually just made a connection with a really decent local one who um are like purely uh kind of organic and they use like vegan inks and everything because we still probably will need to screen print some stuff um but we just we started looking closer to home because if we can build up those relationships than sick yeah um and but yeah so there's this rise in like the technology behind sort of garment decoration sounds like a really lame term but but heat press um dtg which is directed garment which dtg is like literally using a [ __ ] inkjet printer to print onto uh garments and it used to be the same for heat press the heat press used to be just like shitty plasticky vinyl that would like peel off after three washes and yeah i'd never touch that with the barge pole but now there's kind of new technology and new systems where you can basically screen print onto a lamina so you actually you screen print ink onto a laminate and then take that and then use the heat press to actually blend that ink with the fabric so it's kind of like screen printing but a different thing so we've been using systems like that like the last few months have basically just been a lot of testing different styles and things and something that you wouldn't have seen in public aside from a tiny tease in the welcome video is we are connected with it's actually [ __ ] sick they're the company that does all of champions oh yeah like bran like champion do a lot of heat press stuff basically um and they do all the kind of embroidered patches and like cool decorative 3d elements on things like champion and loads of other brands like they do so much stuff it's made by this company and we're we're producing stuff with them at the moment but we don't have it here yet apart from samples but so we can basically create essentially like an embroidered patch or they take stuff to a ridiculous level of how complex they can go uh so we're producing stuff with them as well um so you should be able to do more things than just at the moment we are literally just heat pressing but it'd be nice to get as creative as possible exactly and really understand how clothing works in general yeah and like like i said we'll still be making stuff in factories and making stuff sort of from scratch and at the moment most of the stuff we're heat pressing on is blanks which is something i used to be super objected to but then you come to realize as time goes on and off you get beaten up by shitty orders from factories over the years that like companies that make blanks i mean gildan is like the obvious name and guild and quality is not banging but uh the funny thing is though people never complain no that's the worst i like gildan though but like there are companies that make really nice quality blanks that you kind of want to turn your nose up out because it's like oh it's a blank but they make a t-shirt better than you because all they do is make t-shirts whereas when we try and make a t-shirt with a shitty chinese factory and they [ __ ] up the sizing then we get loads of returns and complaints whereas if you just use a decent like good cotton etc etc they can also focus on making it ethically as well if they're just exactly they're just working on t-shirts themselves then you know that's already taken care of when you buy yeah so i mean one thing that we will potentially move into in the future is making our own blanks because we can still use our existing factories to make our own nice fit of t-shirt for example and then order that in bulk um but like i said all these things are kind of in in development and collaborating this might make collaborating a lot more the future if we want to do something with fifth unit kipper or anyone anyone who we decide to basically they would also do it together and get them in and just have a lot of fun with that and another kind of element of this grand vision that once again these are just kind of the things that we talk about less so than like we're putting action on them but they have they definitely could happen and this is once again just us kind of working in public so to speak is that we have discussed the idea that like we could take this space and future spaces as the thing grows to a stage where we could produce for other people yeah so like let's say fifth unit did that uh zombie hoodie thing for example like the the the idea of being able to essentially produce that in-house and then almost like fulfill that on behalf of another parkour team yeah sounds sick to me because we're providing a service for our friends like there's a level of trust there also there's more involvement of them in the creative process and it's like once again all these things distant future but massive potential and kind of where we want to start moving yeah which could be really really sick so i'm very hot cause i'm sitting next to this radiator yeah it's still on um but it's also exciting so exciting yeah it's really really cool and and yeah kind of as the whole thing grows it's like there's there's just growing potential to as i said like employ people and stuff like this because it's it's hard like to see well no it's not hard to see it's harder to track the sort of the so-called return on investment in like an athlete like you sponsor another athlete you get them to produce stuff or whatever it's it's very hard to know how much revenue that athlete is necessarily bringing in unless you do like referral campaigns where they're giving out discount codes that are tracked and things like this not to say we're not going to [ __ ] sponsor athletes and stuff but it's it's a lot harder for a growing company to put a figure on how much you pay an athlete because you don't know how much they're bringing in whereas if you have someone working directly within the company on an element of it it's easy to see what it's easy to see and it's easy to scale and and so i don't know like we're [ __ ] still even speaking out loud i'm like i don't know what i'm doing but none of us do i just i just want to be able to hire friends and and build a [ __ ] sick team like and it's not like this company's ever going to get to some gym shark size of no 100 billion in revenue or whatever something we didn't even mention as well all of this was happening while covid was going on yeah and it still is obviously now while everyone's moving out of offices we move into one yeah but getting this all sorted and also not being able to have loads of our friends here all the time and we want to do some big projects together as a team yeah oh yeah so we haven't even been able to use this space to its full potential yet really there's definitely like so many things that we potentially maybe in the future hosting little not jams but getting oh that was you guys in we didn't actually mention it on the welcome video or on the patreon but because it's just you can't promise it at the moment but to have you guys the patrons to be able to come here and even use the setup and train not whenever you want but i mean just as like like um open days like that's exactly yeah so like somebody actually let me find the question so we can come in ready pizza to come and train watch movies watch a movie play games come and see how the clothes are made um yeah things like that i think would be really really fun oh yeah once once covered lockdown is over could there be like a workshop type event thing which is like yeah i guess and this place is really small but that's you know could do some coaching yeah oh and the other the other thing actually that's quite cool is that with some of the equipment that we have it's like we we have plans in the future to basically travel with that because we could go to events and rather than just doing straight up like oh selling t-shirts we can be like what what do you [ __ ] want because we can kind of do it right here for you yeah which is sick um should we go through some questions what does it mean to be a man caitlyn not sure why that's in there though actually one thing i did just once does it mean i don't think it's that's a bad question jaden mca stunts no one thing i want to say is that like i'm very aware that this feels very me and keelan right now and it definitely has been and is because we're the only people who've been consistently able to get together marx has been coming down a lot more recently which is sick and i mean granted because we are the two who live locally you're probably going to see most patreon content come from us because we can control it as well yeah and so i think i actually said in the new tmp mag which is totally getting delivered tomorrow that like the youtube is definitely the team vibe of motorist has suffered over covid yeah but because if you think about it the last thing we properly released together was soul destroyer and we haven't been together we haven't really been together since that was being finished while coving i haven't seen johnston since last february so it's been so hard you know yeah um but obviously that should come back once covid is and once we can get the guys back up here like yeah so don't don't fret if you're missing that really um do you do any specific research when it comes to decide clothing colors no not research but we definitely pick a palette that we we never we never just yeah kind of go i like that color like that color yeah i'd say we're definitely trying to pick palettes and also keeping in mind that we i mean it's nice to always make things that just personally me and giles are gonna wear but trying to tap into different colors especially for some of the stuff that's coming up it's very colorful and we might not have it well that's the other thing that's that's that's deciding with colors we've got to think about yeah but that's the thing we haven't spoken about yet is the secret store which i'm very aware sort of just to announce that out of the blue and essentially put that behind a paywall seems like a kind of strange thing like oh here's new products you have to pay to get them yeah but as time goes on and this sort of becomes more like it's just there it's basically what it enables us to do because realistically the people buying paying for the patreon are kind of they're like solid supporters and fans they really want to support the brand and therefore they are going to give us a very good like litmus test of what's going to do well elsewhere in the community et cetera so to to have a sort of niche group who we can essentially test like let's say 10 different colorways of a design and then we've got things on there right now though yeah well we are basically testing yeah we can we we can drop like so we drop this kind of varsity thing which is granted very very simple but just it's kind of just a test we just want to see what colors pop off what works we've got more designs coming on there soon and most of the stuff on there will transition over to the main store sort of at some stage but we can't guarantee everything will because some stuff might just not sell like you might be the only [ __ ] person who wants a purple and green shirt but that might be on the secret store but if no one else buys it then it's not going to end up on the main thing so it's kind of it gives you that opportunity to really if you see something that you want on there and i've been trying to think i've got some ideas of how we can show the secret store off a little bit more so that other people are aware of it um but yeah that's that's kind of that reason really nice but yeah with colors at the moment we're getting pretty bold and experimentive because we can because we can do the tests we're not it we're not spending thousands on like 600 t-shirts of one color that's being stuck with that minimum yeah that is the benefit of the blanks basically yeah you know it's a huge benefit yeah uh do we have a plan on making a shoe it is 100 something we would love to do but also not something we've no if we're doing what we're doing right now i guess is heading in the right direction if there was a direction to head for yeah um but yeah i think every parkour brown would absolutely love to make a shoe but it is just so expensive uh most is the best no question thank you very much ampersand scott bass where is the actual place kent somewhere he's going to come and do a [ __ ] overnight challenge imagine i'm going to have one imagine if overnight challenges were still a thing to anyone listening to this the place is covered in cameras and alarms and i live down the road and i sleep with a baseball bat next to my bed because i have a really aggressive meaty big scary dog called darwin i had a really scary dream once the house was getting broken into and i genuinely thought it was real and i woke up and bought a baseball bat really yeah i mean i told you that what nerve i got a baseball bat next to my bed purely because i had like a [ __ ] a real do you know those dreams that are just just real yeah and somebody had just broken into the house and was like charging up the stairs and i woke up in a panic and just went on amazon and bought a baseball bat wow then i think i went back to sleep so uh it's still there yeah it's just it's what i don't have anything else to do with it it's not like next to my [ __ ] pillow like ready to go but it's like you ever got have you ever had a scare and gone to ground no no never like it just it's in that room i don't i think it's down the side of the bedside table basically but um to scott's question it is in kent somewhere it's basically in the middle of nowhere near-ish to my house and a little bit further away from keelan's house but closer than my house to keelans nice and it's in a beautiful scenic area um [Music] which is not great if you want to be in the inner city and have loads of people strolling by but i think we like it i really like it being here compared to being like a busy bit there's cows around here yeah there's cows there's more alpacas and sheep i would say than kale yeah there's a lot of alpacas one of those little birds oh i hear [ __ ] i hate another no i didn't hit another day oh i almost had a deer last night yeah he said that and also the other night when i was coming back from here you know um when the launch happened and i came to here a squirrel ran that was last night yeah oh there you go last night on the way here i watched a squirrel run no in the car in front of me and he nearly it's so upsetting because it missed the front wheel oh could have just waited but like when you can't see oh they can't see my hands yeah i just watched it pay for the uh pay the patreon police i just watched the whole body and the head just get completely flattened into the concrete it was just it was so active and then suddenly but it into the concrete you know because it's a square oh yeah anyway a couple of weeks ago killed it [ __ ] awful so bad and then the other night another one he literally jumped out in front of sarah's car sarah's brand new car and uh it like dives down the bank really steep bank in front of me and i was already going quite slowly because of the where i was on the road yeah but i literally just went [ __ ] off i just shouted at it i was like [ __ ] off it happens here that okay so that is the downside of here not that there is men we're in the countryside yeah the animal was lovely i almost hit a [ __ ] a goose with a with a frisbee this morning i was out i was throwing the frisbee for darwin and i think three geese flew over my head and like the frisbee basically was heading towards them and they veered away it was funny uh how much clothing is now produced in-house compared to how it used to be i don't know an exact percentage because it like i mean the secret store stuff i'd like to say yeah but overall if it was a guess i'd say over 50 surely i think we're moving maybe 50 percent for the hoodies t-shirts yeah like for this summer um yeah mark is true you're wearing hats yeah uh for this summer we'll be doing a lot of stuff in house that is hoodies t-shirts long sleeves etc etc trousers and shorts we're producing still and basically forever will be because we're not going to [ __ ] make trousers yourself yeah um and but yeah we'll be doing a lot of that as we move towards winter we'll probably get some outerwear and things done in factories and things but um but yeah it just it's just there's so much more creativity and fun so um do you think you're going to be hiding better content behind the paywall we've kind of covered this already but i wouldn't say it's very very different to anything that is on youtube so is it better content it's really subjective better if you really want to see the behind the scenes of what we're doing like like the build videos that keelan edited are quite raw quite personal yeah it's just real and they're just yeah it's just us building this place out and like if you were just some like i would probably wouldn't care to see this from let's say a band that i didn't like but a band that i did like i'd probably like it because i want to support them yeah so it's like we're not hiding like [Music] parkour videos no yeah nothing nothing that like we think like this the type of content that we're putting out granted if we edited it a different way would probably do well on youtube but it's not like we're putting out some how do we i don't want to [ __ ] on it because obviously people are paying for it it's it's really good i really enjoy watching it but it's just it's not for everyone yeah so there you go that's it yeah um what was the most challenging thing setting it all up this whole place um dealing with [ __ ] darwin every day yeah literally just getting a dog like him to settle down no i think for me there's been a lot of trying to get the shipping and fulfillment set up so it's efficient cost effective like moving back from the fulfillment center making sure that we've got good rates for postage obviously we then had things like brexit happen and we had i mean the christmas we just got everything back into our hands and then that christmas rush hit where like kovid [ __ ] everything it was like it was already because of that was it they were already already because of kobe like week like multiple multiple week delays on packages and then because of covid like they had less staff at the centers especially in like the us there were images coming out of stuff just piled so the customer service was insane like we had people not getting packages for like two and a half months and you're just on the end of an email being like i'm so sorry and we were just doing everything in-house back then it was mostly you anyway i got covered around that time yeah i was like cheers uh how much would it hurt to put your hand in the heat press 170 degrees i mean in squash i mean we've i mean have we burnt ourselves about my finger cleaning it yeah but that's just tapping it but if you're talking about in so that means you're actually shutting the heat press your hand i mean it's it closes incredibly tightly what do we print out 150 170 170 degrees yeah yeah so imagine 170 degrees tightly squeezing your hand yeah handshaking you that's what it is fletcher oh fletcher's sick he bought the beige cargos and he wears them all the time um he asks are the prices of warehouses like the one you selected at a reasonable price in the uk um if we were up north we could probably get this place for 50p we live in a really expensive area of the uk so no like i mean we can afford it and it's kind of it's all good so to speak but it's not yeah you can definitely get spaces like this cheaper but we have got a really good setup due to a number of factors um but yeah why am i so handsome i don't think i am actually sometimes i look in the mirror and i'm like oh you look good is that who is that from baja piko do you ever do that do you look in the moon you're like yeah yeah yeah then but then it's annoying because if that does happen there's always days where you look in the mirror and you're expecting that again this lockdown you're like oh my haircut is awful oh yeah it's not good i never think about her oh i do yeah um do you like the look of yourself well yeah yeah i've had to reinforce it with my no hair i had to kind of oh you have to get used to look a little bit longer and be like oh this is new me okay yeah i'm a thug you must have a bit i like you yeah it's a weird thought actually just thinking about day to day sometimes you just do like the way you look sometimes you have the right outfit and you yeah you're feeling fresh i'm pretty happy all the time with it yeah no but i mean just the thought process i wouldn't say i'm not happy when i look in the mirror right now i'm not unhappy but i desperately need a haircut i could probably do with a shave like yeah and i feel a bit sweaty yeah if i haven't shaved and i realize and i'm out i'm like oh no like good haircut had a shower wearing a nice outfit a little bit of aftershave or whatever and you look in the mirror and you're like oh oh everyone's paying for the patreon now so they can see yeah um have you ever considered building a parkour gym in the future 100 something well actually i used to [ __ ] absolutely bucket list goals i still would love to and instead of part of me would love like a a huge uh sprawling amount of gyms around the world or whatever but also imagine if we had one while covered hit though oh my god yeah [ __ ] poor people because the thing about this place it obviously affects it a bit but we're not relying on people coming in here to pay to use the setup yeah i i think now that this idea has kind of scaled in our head um i'm i'm definitely not ruling it out and it's something that i still probably would jump the opportunity to do but also i love the idea of like this being three times bigger in a couple of years time with a substantial training set up with a good like i mean like i said we're never gonna have hundreds of staff like you look at even some of the big escape brands and they run on a fairly bare bones crew but like i want that environment to be just everyone loves the sport everyone loves the brand everyone's friends but also there's a training set up where like you can train and and it's just sick like exactly that's the goal baby um yeah so anyone who has listened to s town that was recently introduced to us will you get the stock back from past years no we might do like forward like especially now that we've opened up the the park i've and i've i've laid out all the because i've always stored like old most designs and things but now we have them in a slightly more accessible place so it would be cool to maybe return to some ideas and be like oh like let's bring back this style or something but yeah nothing certain um scott taylor asked when was the discord link going out but then we sorted that because i messaged him but that's a really cool thing about the patreon is you set up a discord because i don't understand it but it's basically a big change yeah and we've all got our own emojis that are our faces yeah we're not seeing that but that is not your head i think yeah i saw that you posted it yeah there's one for you there's one for me oh yes yeah we should use the patreon more but anyone who's signed up for discord more anyone who's on the patreon should use the discord because it's just oh and also to get a hold of us and also yeah like for this for the patreon reason anyway and any discussions towards the club get the patreon app if you've kind of looked at this so far and gone like oh [Music] i like the idea of it but i don't want to sign on to a [ __ ] website to like because most people are on their phones nowadays there is an app for patreon and it's a way better experience because you just get notifications and it's like oh the most products uploaded this and you're like oh sick and you watch a video on your phone so it's cool yeah it's really nice how was most formed in the beginning what was the thought process um a totally different thought process to where it is now so funny you've got the first two people here who was on it yeah very true this is the initial three the initial the initial goal was like oh i want to start a brand that can like give back significantly to events and things and really i was very naive because i was just like sell t-shirts you use that money to give events money but then actually you don't think about it yeah about it there's a lot less well there's a lot more in there with regards to actually making a sustainable business and profits and that's the other thing i was going to say with this place is like we're doing this and moving into this kind of model because we want this thing to be sustainable for years to come like it's it's a rocky landscape out there for any small business especially given geopolitical climate issue climate like all the [ __ ] that's gone in the world in the last couple years so it's like trying to move towards this hopefully we'll we just want to have longevity we want to [ __ ] stay around we want to do cool stuff we want to grow but it's also the right direction for if we because it would be sick to start giving back again in small quantities in any way we can oh yeah having this space now kind of enables us to be more creative with how we do that and we still we still do bits here and there i don't know if that's public actually i was just about to say the the uh the event thing that we were talking about in may he um you lost me it's yeah i put it in the whatsapp the the i'm not gonna name it because it might not be a public thing yet but we've just donated a lot of stuff to that to help that go ahead um but yeah i don't know it's all changing it's all grown it's all cool it's all gravy baby gravy baby oh i'm having for heaters tonight i'm so happy is that all the questions um will there be more special rewards discounts and stuff for the workshop i yeah what are we doing about discounts well i think we'll probably just end up chucking like exclusive discount codes in there occasionally um we kind of we've got a lot of content backlogged and there's also a lot of things that we're going to introduce i.e more stuff to the secret store etc etc that we just didn't want to we wanted to give you a load when you joined yesterday but hopefully and in fact in three minutes time another video is dropping so we've probably wrapped this up and shared the build episode too too yeah um but yeah feel free as well if there's if there's something that we're quite stupidly missing that we could be doing here for you for the for the patreon because it is for you guys then let us know anything that you want to know about this place or any help or any sort of videos that we can create yep as long as it's not the purpose illegal it could probably be illegal i was more thinking like weird just like oh can you film yourself going to the toilet oh did you hear that that's my throat i thought it was me i was like it's like a little burp coming up gross grace grossly awesome sick we should yeah we should probably wrap this up i want to talk about music just to piss off all the time i know so many people like don't talk about music while she sleeps wait for while she sleeps now error architects anyway should we [ __ ] you aaron i love talking about music [Laughter] shall we shall we um shall we wrap it yeah well thank you for listening sorry max i don't feel like you've spoken much that's all right it was all about you guys he's in here for the journey yeah yeah he's in it to win it marx has done a lot by the way mark has got a really cool thing that he's been working on actually i'm not sure when it will come out and in what form it will come out but it's he's impressed me with his uh ingenuity and creativity with it so yeah um wicked bye video people you if you've watched this far oh [ __ ] if you have watched this far you're amazing

China boy is a million-dollar dog when we brought him here in China it was just so many different people seeing him and being hateful oh my god can I take a picture this is a real bully right here everybody that sees it is like total package we founded oh three bullies about five years ago in 2015 when we got our first dog robe we have eight dogs in the property right now so what I'm doing right now is the morning routine right now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna feed them so this is Rome Rogue is the one that really started us in the greeting this is the first one we got so she's an American bully this is bougie this is Milky Way so this is parish this is our friend she she's just a fat we don't breed her but she's the queen of the house we took protection work we do dog training we do rehabbing rescue dogs just everything that has to do with dogs we trained for commercials we trained for music videos it's just what we do so this is og China boy so this right here is og China boy he's the complete package when you look at oh gee China boy and you look at anything he has when it comes to head he's 13 14 inches he's about 75 pounds and every part of him he's just everything you could ask for in a bully we got him in China from our partners and dong-chil he's the founder of og his temperament is amazing and he's loved by everybody no matter if you're an exotic lover American Bully lover he just gets accepted by everybody he's the total package so breeders are like we could use him and improve our yard so it makes LG China boy so unique is he has everything great that American Bully has and when it comes to his muzzle he has the exotic features which what we like oh gee China boys stud fee at the moment is $5,000 we have $18,000 offer that I haven't accepted yet just because I want to wait to see the puppies when he came here it just took off in the first 30 days he had 30 lock-ins which is unheard of see how I was it was crazy I would say he made 200,000 in the first 40 days here just offers studs and lock-ins so when you put a value to a dog he's priceless a million-dollar dog so now I'm gonna let them out let's go shot let's go outside let's go come on come let's go Lukey come come on then I just leave him out there and I start the cleanup we've had mb8 music artists coaches reach out to us it's crazy to see the feedback that we're getting from everybody DMX is someone that actually wants to meet China boy he's a big dog lover we have a daughter she'll be three next month and her name is Sariah Paris your favorites right yeah she is like their mother she reads to them and she helps up with everything really when it comes to yeah dog give him the ball Emma [Music] pay respect sir ILO is like she bosses them around they listen to her the temperament is amazing when it comes to kids we have no problem today what we got going on is we got a few people that's coming to meet China Boyd one of the persons that are coming is keV Greene he's the president of BRC it's interesting to see what his take on China boy is so he gets to see him today in person what's up man what's that what's up man nice to meet you follow me every two to me

front of see them in person hey buddy hey buddy hey wow wow this is a real bully right here you don't see bullies that look like this bullies nowadays they don't got that wow factor when you walk out and the first time you see a dog and say wow that's what you want you know you don't want to lose that this is what you weren't ready this is the first time that I met China boy yes in person his best attributes would definitely be his head his muzzle he's got a nice bone nice real thick rear and he's overall just real well put together we don't often see a dog that looks like that in person a lot of people's pictures that they do post our doctor pictures in this really looks like he doesn't in the picture for us is easy because it is a job at the end of the day but we've never felt that oh my god I wish this Friday feeling you know sometimes we don't even realize that it's the weekend we did this because we love doing it it's not about the money so for us we do this because we love it [Music]", "y8T7U47kdIA": "[Music] sometimes when i'm thinking about us before we got lost and we parted back to back we would carry on and we'd do anything for what we started [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] for me for me [Music] for foreign [Music] for me sometimes in the world news happens and in the world of fbv when news happens one team is there to cover it it's jb and it's plenty welcome this is what i think about while i'm listening to the music blendy how you doing man good how are you doing joshua i'm good plenty i once had a i once had a if you go back it's the right time on my channel you can hear i once had a really bad cold and i lost my voice and my voice got super deep i could barely talk and i when i did talk it sounded like that and i made a recording of a movie announcing in a world except and it was like in a world it was about me doing fpv videos the thing is i want to be a movie announcer what's your dream what do you want to be when you grow up uh stand-up comedian i'll probably do that at some point oh man i could see it it's uh it's it's quite a it's i i also sometimes aspire to be a stand-up comedian and i didn't i instead i just use my material here on the live stream yeah fair enough and welcome to you guys as well welcome to the uh welcome to the livestream uh it is time for the news fpv news every tuesday at 6 pm eastern time which is now you're here you knew that and we're gonna go over with so many things this week um what do we have this week blunty give us a rundown of the topics all right so this week shark bite they did their two-week update as they promised so yeah they said they would and then they did and that's the first thing you got to do yeah and it's not hollow so it's good there's meat there right good good we've we've got a tiny black box logger that's smaller than an sd card pretty cool yeah yep if you don't have that black box logging on your quad that'll be very interesting race day quads has finally filed the lawsuit against the faa so we'll talk a little bit about that yep good the ztag drone laser system is finally shipped and launched so we'll talk about that a little bit if you want to practice shooting down other drones with your drone this is one way to do it dji assistant has been having an issue on mac os big sur and we'll talk about how to fix that yeah this is a specific dji has been having a lot of issues with this launch this is a specific issue that affects you if you're running mac os big s or is that are there a lot of the what's big sur it's i'm not a mac guy either but it's a later operating system and mac and uh apparently a lot of people are having an issue with it so and we have to fix thanks to a user that's that's why you're here we've got a cool led board project for visualizing motor issues nice yeah i did an interview with fpv blue an older hd video system creator if you guys want to check that out we'll talk about that a little bit and there there will be those who say that promoting your own content on this live stream is favoritism and nepotism and i will say what yeah of course but also it's a really great it's a really great interest you actually got some really interesting exclusives from this guy who who he he's been he i'm just i want people to stick around for this segment i'm going to spoil it a teeny bit this guy tried if you don't know fpv blue they tried he was trying to invent a high definition long distance digital controlling for fpv for years and he has some deep insights into what fat shark needs to do to beat dji and why he is no longer in the game yeah this is a great interview we're going to spill a little bit of beans about it but people obviously should go watch it too anyway continue uh so we've got a couple community spotlights a few of them this week we're going to show some frame resonance analysis some actual science in this hobby with chris rosser um really fascinating stuff that's super cool yeah if you have jello in your camera or your uh your uh flight controller gyro is freaking out then you suspect it's your frame maybe it is your frame yeah um we've got another community spotlight with pablo spakowski he's got a diy motion controller like the dji controller you can make it home with a 3d printer and some electronics love it uh we've got a another community spotlight we've got your logo on a drone with the hologram and when this when this guy said i'm gonna put your logo as a hologram on a drone i was like okay okay cool and then he sent me the video and it's like yeah whatever and then i watched the video and i was like oh that's pretty badass cool yeah uh we'll talk about how cyclone fpv um has been helping out customers that can't activate their dji goggles like we've talked about before by actually shipping them a broken down drone pretty cool but broken down he doesn't mean what you think he means so yeah um we've also got the longest drone flight on record a 13 hour drone flight 205 miles talk about how that's possible yeah yikes 13 hours i mean you need a you need a you need a uh uh what are they called a meal break in the middle of that flight i'm gonna have to have a flight attendant bring you some bring some peanuts uh we've got a drone lawsuit where we found that images from a drone need a warrant in michigan it's kind of interesting precedent they're sitting there locally talk about why that might impact people there and what that could do yeah okay um iflate their beast h7 has a bi-directional d-shot issue we'll explain what that is and why you need to be concerned about it and well a little bit if you own an eye flight b stage seven then i'm afraid we have bad news you know that you know that thing we talked about a minute ago where there's a problem and then we have the solution that that's not this well we do have a solution but you lose part of the functionality on the flight controller if you use the solution so that okay so not a perfect solution if you have a b stage seven stick around for that one um and last but not least israel has started getting serious about drone delivery and they've actually been live testing a control room and dispatch system so we'll talk a little bit about that nice awesome all righty oh i just need to just need to stretch here get ready and here we go let's dive in with shark bite uh and sharkbite said a little while back they they sort of one of the places fat shark excels which we're going to talk later in the fpv blue segment about what sharkbite needs to do to beat dji but one of the places that they have always excelled is in sort of being members of the fpv community you'll notice i didn't say responding to feedback from the fpv community can we have a power button please that only took years but they've they're in the fpv community and they're sort of doubling down on that by promising that they're going to do development updates on sharkbite like sharkbite is we it's not we want it to be better we're going to tell you what we're doing and you and i when we were talking about the show we said well next week we'll either say here it is or we'll say ah they didn't do it and they did it yeah yeah and there's a couple different ways this could have gone i mean they could have easily put out a one or two you know paragraph statement that they're slowly working on things and eventually they'll release more info and stuff because it's only been you know two weeks since they've asked for this feedback but instead what we got is uh quite an extensive list of things they kind of seem to have detailed most of the feedback they received and i've kind of gone through a gamut of different changes that they're going to implement they've already you know done a couple things like they've already they're already going to include a longer firmware flashing cable uh with their new units when they ship that's just a small change they could do that people ask for they're going to allow race directors to use special channels if you contact them to unlock special channels they're talking to devs for other firmwares to do osd implementation that they haven't done before um there's a lot of stuff like that but also it seems like they're committing to um hardware changes too you know they're talking about their they're going to look into larger and better cameras they're going to look into a next generation vtx where there's better penetration more range higher power better thermal management just basically everything you would ask from a new vtx yeah you know they're talking about um and i think kind of the big thing for me since i don't have that track goggles um they're talking about an all digital goggle solution basically a native digital goggle that they are working on and may release yeah really good stuff um it listening to the community and delivering what the community is asking for and just showing that you're paying attention honestly that can get you can have a a less capable product and people will still buy it i i will still buy it if i feel like you're paying attention to me and you're you're carrying just i just want a hug that's all i want um especially the digital goggle is so exciting if they can like really go back to the drawing board and deliver something like i wanted to have oh give it oh please let have oled screens yeah it's so clear even working on a new look for them you know so i assume that they're good they're not going to be the standard fat shark you know bar or whatever they're not going to reuse the dominator shell again yeah so and with this whole thing you know they still say you know we're going to work on you know listen to your feedback do you like what we're doing they added a true pit mode i guess and they're asking people to test that tell them if that's the pit mode they're asking for because they're not actually super clear on exactly what people want it's just a lot of interaction with users i'm interested to see how long they keep this up but i think it's super cool to see arkhant in the chat asks ar arcant c-h-o-n-t just to be clear as to what word i was saying there our content the chat says is fat shark gonna stick to divi math chips obviously no one knows what fat shark is going to do but divim math is the solution they have worked hard at they have so much investment in divi math um it seems unlikely that there's anywhere else for them to go other than maybe something we'll talk about in the fpv blue segment yeah uh needs a higher output power says adam victor true but they're already struggling with their thermal management they could barely get the thing where it is without like melting it so i don't see them i mean if they could just flip a switch and have higher output power surely they would so there's a reason that they haven't they need to figure that out but it sounds like they're aware of that and they're trying to work on it so yeah good good excellent all right fat shark keep it up keep up the good work next uh next up blunty you've brought us a a tiny black box logger and i'll tell you when i first saw this i immediately thought of the open logger device not an open logger but an open lager that's this little thing that some of you may have seen yeah and that is not what this is no here's the open lager so the open logger is a really cool solution um there's just a couple issues with that one is that 20 bucks isn't super cheap yeah no kidding you also need to add an sd card um so you have the weight of the open logger plus the sd card and it's a little bigger than the sd plus you have to add an sd to it well i'll say one more thing about the open logger it breaks it's got this flip up door for the sd card and it like if you don't mount it right or it comes loose it's just destroyed it's not as durable as you might hope um so they basically somebody designed um this guy here alex um esten i guess uh designed a tiny black box i mean this is an open source hardware project and software that you can use for an open source block box logger that all together with data flash chip on it 16 megs is smaller than an sd card so the downside here is a 16 meg data flash is going to last you a few flights depending on how you're logging how fast you're logging you might get two or three flights you might get five or ten flights but you're not going to be able to fly 20 50 100 flights all day like you can with an sd card um but the upside is it's completely self-contained very lightweight inexpensive is it for sale or do you have to build your own no i don't know that anybody's for sale on these i'm actually going to look into trying to make some of these and put them up on my store if possible but um because they are open source hardware projects so but i would encourage anybody if you have the ability to make these and sell them well surely somebody like airbot is going to make them and so yes they i hope so because these are excellent devices um you know and you talked about the 16 meg limit also we talked before about 4.3 options and in uh looks like in betaflight 4.3 we'll be able to reduce a lot of those black box things that we're not using and cut out a lot of data that we don't need um so we could log hopefully more logs on to that 16 i've wanted that forever like betaflight logs all this data and so often when i'm recording the only thing i care about is the stick positions because i'm recording like a tutorial or a freestyle flight and i just want the stick overlay and if you had just the stick positions recorded that data flash chip would i mean potentially it would go for 20 50 flights without filling up the chip and betaflight 4.3 will give you the option to turn off individual black box logging elements i'm really excited about that dominic clifton says uh the dominic clifton says that's neat w2 5q128 equals good flash chip i assume he would know yeah it's also only 11 components um it's really it seems to be a slick design um you know dominic clifton says he can make him i know a bunch of people would buy them yeah so yeah and if they're i mean i don't know what the price would be i have no idea what the bill of materials and then markup would be but presumably it's not going to be twenty dollars right and on most i feel like on most builds you can find a place to slide a half gram sd card sized logger it's a lot easier than trying to fit out the locker you could stick it on the back of your because you're not going to have to get out the sd card you could stick it on the back of your camera wait wait wait how do you how do you get the data off of it with sd card reader you pull it out yes so basically you are going to um connect the flight controller to the pc you put it in a read mode and then you run a python script and it'll pull it right off the logger it doesn't mount as like a usb drive like like betaflight builds in one that would be cool that's like i wish they yeah unfortunately i think right now that's a limitation of the uh of the setup okay so still not perfect but but something getting there that's sort of one of those things where like they were trying to get the size down and i think to get the size down they're only there's like a limitation of the ability yeah because they show right here like look how small this thing is you want black box logging on a on a freaking toothpick or a tiny whoop i mean if even an sd card is too big and too heavy for you there you go it certainly is going to fit into a niche it's pretty slick alrighty um let's go on to the next one um we're gonna talk about the race day quads lawsuit uh i actually i would say i did an interview with tyler brennan and jonathan uh jonathan why can't i'm always blanking on his last name jonathan with a lawyer i did an interview with them uh just yesterday it's in editing it's going to come out on my channel this week it's about a half hour 40 minutes where they talk about some of the things and i know they've been doing the rounds because they just actually made good on their promise to sue the faa yeah i think a lot of people were wondering like oh is this going to go through or remote id you know passed and it doesn't seem as bad that sort of thing but they're kind of saying that like they definitely want to go full steam ahead on this they're still collecting money they're still pushing all forward they've again they filed the lawsuit um and they've also said you know tyler has said you know i and other anonymous individuals believe that the remote id rule was changed not because they care about us or listen to us but because the remote id network they originally proposed simply is not ready when it is ready it will be imposed on us unless we fight remote id now so they're basically trying to plan for an eventuality they think will happen yeah and i i pardoned me i asked him about this uh in the interview and he basically said don't drop your guard because there was this big i made the analogy that when when we first saw the nprm it's like the faa said we're coming for you and we're cutting off all of your fingers and then the rule came out and it wasn't as bad as we thought and it's like they said okay we're only cutting off two of your fingers and everybody was like well i'm you know we're not happy about it but it's better than it could have been and what tyler's saying is they're coming for the rest of your fingers okay it's a morbid analogy but uh nothing says they can't take the rest of your fingers and and what what what i think the fear is that people will look at remote id as it currently stands and say yeah i can live with that and then lose the the uh passion for the fight and then two years from now three years from now whenever when remote id is ready then they'll come back and they'll be like oh now you know now we're gonna make it worse and he's like forget it we're stopping this we're headed off stopping it right at the beginning so they have basically they have like filed the paperwork that says we intend to sue you i don't know what the official name of it is but there's no actual legal arguments being made yet so we still don't know how they actually intend to approach the fight but um there you go yeah 507 rc in the chat points out at this time shows up a lot in the remote id regulation yeah yep yeah yep they they wanted this network requirement that would have your drone continuously broadcasting its location and other identifying information through like the cell network to a database every time you fly all the time in real time that's an oversimplification but it's somewhat true and i think they they overreached and it just wasn't possible to implement that today and so they rolled back on it but they didn't do that because they're nice or because they heard our voice is tyler's argument yeah if you have fewer fingers it's harder to fight them cutting more fingers off says in the three frame i came up with that analogy because we saw the final ruling and i was like oh this isn't as bad as it could have been and people were like how could you be happy about this and i'm like look i'm not like happy but um i'm like i'm relieved they could have been worse so yeah yeah i guess the question the real question there is did they have any care about us like tyler says or was it strictly because they didn't have the ability to do any more than they did you know did they play nice because they couldn't do their crazy stuff there's no i think there's no way to know unless you're like literally in the meetings with the decision makers i feel like they had to have heard our voice somewhat yeah i hope i don't know um speaking of the i'm going to inject one thing here that's not on the on the agenda speaking of the fight against the faa uh one of the ways that i am trying to help uh fight this is by helping to make the flow state fpv drone documentary and uh although it's a passion project of mine and something i've wanted to do just because i love fpv and i'd love for there to be a documentary film about fpv in the fpv community it is also being driven by the threat that remote id presents the goal being to get positive information and awareness of fbv out there into the world so we have more people to fight on our side and this weekend i'm going to asheville to uh to see the very first test screening of the film awesome we rented a theater and it's invitation only very small select crowd and uh so it's getting closer and closer to coming out uh so i just want to put that out there i'm excited to see it i think a lot of people are excited to see it if you wanted to come from denver you'd be welcome i could i can get you in i know that's a lot to ask but yeah we'll talk about it all right all right all right what's next uh z tag we talked about a little bit before when we talked about some different laser tag solutions um has launched finally their laser tag solution it's a little bit diy but it's pretty cool that they've got something on sale and available for you to pick up um so basically this is the one we showed before where you kind of get the you're just using the little view in your camera so you're mounting it right in front of the camera as your osd for the system and uh they've got a few different teams now so they've got a domination mode where you can like fight each other with colors and play zombie mode where you absorb each other's color stuff like that different game modes um but basically you just buy the little boards and then you'll put the boards into some 3d printed mounts for whatever quad you have and you can fly away and do swim uh laser tag yeah the cool thing about this system is that it doesn't require any sort of integration into the quadcopter like you don't have to solder it to your flight controller or your receiver you just put it so you can see it in the camera and it's completely self-contained and that's uh that's pretty cool z tags is in the chat and he says rotor right we'll be stalking them too oh there he is z tag rc rotor right will be well that's awesome um i think he said he's demoing those um at rampage on some cine loops nice and they're and they're gonna do like a spec class of them basically so they can sell a certain amount and have like a game and stuff so pretty cool awesome yeah that's exciting that's really it sounds really fun i got to play velocidrone combat this weekend uh and last weekend uh after my sunday live stream i played philosopher in combat with some of the folks from my discord server and siati's discord server and i gotta say uh dog fighting i would have thought that dog fighting with drones would be just too sort of twitchy and frenetic and not really fun to be fair velocidrone combat does specifically use these great big slow lumbering drones for dog fighting but it was really fun it was really fun yeah i've played it a little bit i want to get like a foot pedal for the shooting yes yeah i think that's the key but it seems pretty cool yeah if you haven't checked out velocitron combat it's basically a first-person shooter that you play with drones you chase each other around the map shooting each other and uh it's super and i think do you think it makes you better pilot 100 yeah any stick time i always tell people any stick time is better and if you're controlling the drone to go somewhere fight somebody like you're going to learn something about muscle memory doing that it's kind of like quake almost with drones because you get power-ups when you shoot different things and stuff yeah okay velocity and combat little plug there yeah awesome awesome uh what else have we got so look forward to the ztec and there's links there's links in the video description to all the stuff we're talking about in case that wasn't obvious go ahead monty uh so if you've been having uh or if you know someone with a issue with dji fpv assistant or i think any dji assistant right now is having some of these issues and you're on mac ls big sur you can use this fix from a user caleb that submitted it to the fpv news news at sorry what's the address news fpvnodel.com there we go news at fpvknowitdoll.com um he submitted this to and basically this is a fix because for some reason mac uh os big sur um is blocking it with system integrity protection so basically this walks you through the ability uh to change that um to get it to work then it will connect to your goggles everything will activate and work properly and then you can re-enable system integrity protection when you're done yeah and i just said like okay yeah good i don't really use a mac but if there's people out there who are being affected by this and this helps them then they should just like there's a link to this uh imager uh album down in the video description or you just freeze frame here and uh print it out on your printer like a boom [Laughter] and hopefully that helps some people uh let me get this super chat from isaac mitchell thank you for five dollar super chat isaac thanks for being awesome and doing what you do blunty is amazing i'm very grateful you guys make time for all of us well thank you very much isaac and bags of tv uh says cheers thanks for five bucks bags um let's see here i'm thinking all right from the community so you've got an an led board that's next up for diagnosing motors and basically this is kind of like race wire but instead of race wire where it's a pass-through this is actually a um uh in-line solution so basically you can put this between your esc and your motor and these are actually wired in parallel so you can see each light light up when each uh fet uh powers on so you can see that all all six sets are working properly yeah this is uh this is a a good uh tool i i noticed this the first time i used light up race wire the way that light up race wire works is that the motor current uh causes the leds to light up and there's like three strips and they equate to the three phases of the motor and i noticed that when the esc like would beep it would go i could see the individual phases and the first time i had a blown esc with a bad fit i noticed that one of the leds didn't light up and i was like oh my god this race wire is such a good troubleshooting tool but you may not want it for on your quad for whatever reason so in this situation where you've got a motor that won't spin and you're not sure if the esc is fried you could totally just see whether the esc is sort of firing uh to spin the motor and uh it's a great little thing now this is also open source yes yeah if you then there's a link in there this is like a blog article but there's a link in there um if you scroll down a little bit to the hackaday project that's the first link in that article and it's up on oash park as well yeah so he actually has a link to which parts he could order the boards straight off the spark link now that'll just be a naked pcb you have to solder it up yourself or they do they do the software do they make it i believe it's a naked pcb and then you'll do the soldering yourself with the components he he offers or he says to use basically so once once again somewhere someone out there race day quads pyrodrone airbot someone eye flight this is an open source project anyone could make this it's a cool little thing and if you're selling it for a couple bucks go ahead monty so to be clear i think the the major difference between this and the typical race wire is a race wire is not wired um basically per phase like with two leds to represent each fet so with race wire sometimes you you don't see one of the fets going bad with this you can literally see the individual fets that are bad so if three fats were bad you would see three leds go out on this huh that's interesting yeah it says here if everything is operational the red and green leds on each phase should glow evenly but if there are problems because the blinking will become erratic or one or more leds fail to light at all so i think this is more of a diagnosis tool than raceway would be whether it's like hey it's getting through or not this will tell you like what's exact kind of more a better idea of what's wrong yeah because the way it's wired in parallel really slick really slick good good stuff um yeah looking forward to seeing that uh either people obviously if you can a lot of people aren't going to be able to solder this up on their own just i wouldn't want to go out there you you need a hot air gun and you wouldn't really need it soldering you wouldn't be able to do it with a soldering iron but i think a product like this is useful enough somebody will start making them if you don't want to uh build it your own build yourself yeah i got a 20 super chat here from ztag rc thanking us for the mentions uh we really want to bring pilots together with a new fpv experience also looking to connect with clubs and leagues out there you know blunty i said veloci z tag might be like playing velocity in combat in real life the difference being that if you get hyper fixated on trying to shoot somebody out of the air and then you crash well the velocity drone combat you're just like okay i just get back up again but in real life not so much so uh yeah yeah consequences yeah when you do that dive to go catch somebody gotta make sure you can pull out yeah um grim fpd you're right you can wire up standard leds to the motors to do the same this is not a complicated idea it's just a convenient and clever you know way of doing it so yeah um okay uh let's talk about this interview blunty that you did with the owner of fpv blue what can you tell tell for people who don't know who was fpv blue and uh why should we care what they say blue started he actually started the first project back in 2012 he said but his first like pcb he developed was 2015 and basically fpv blue was an attempt to use off-the-shelf solutions to build an hd video system by one person in his house uh as a hobby project to break even to try to develop hd video for the hobby it was literally a passion project he was never planning to make money um he lost money you know um and it was literally just to see like hey can i do this it seems like i could do this you know and he did it he definitely did it it's pretty incredible to see he had a working system he actually i talked to him once and he we were talking about me doing a review of his system and i ended up not doing it although i would have to go to my emails to remember the exact reason i ended up not doing it either it was either the cost or the performance i don't remember late that was likely the issue because it's more it was came out as a wing solution so i think the lowest latency they got was around 58 milliseconds glass to glass and that was just because something they talk about which is asic design you know there's a big issue with these solutions where you need a quality asic to do the work in the systems otherwise you're working on decoding and encoding latency well let's let's and what's an asic uh i don't know what asic stands for actually but basic is basically a hardware chip that has a bunch of hardware pathways that are set up for you to do a bunch of math i guess is the best way to do it great great it's it's like i i think it's like taking a computer program and encoding it in the hardware design as opposed to having a general purpose microprocessor that can do lots of things so asics are extremely fast at doing one thing yes and the problem is they're extremely expensive to develop uh because if you make an asic and you're like you know what turns out i wanted to change that a little sorry because making the silicon dies and whatever is it's and so we actually uh that that may not be the case uh because dji seems to have a situation where they've found a way to have a hardware front end for the asic but they can program with software a controller for the asic and somehow that's because obviously they pulled 50 megabits per second out of their butt um so if they had obviously that was either somehow where hardware encoded into the asic originally and they unlocked it or they had some ability to work differently with the information coming out of that asic um a lot of people in chat want to make sure we know that it's the application specific integrated circuit and another nice sense because you're building it for the application nystack says so it's basically an fpga without the p yeah so at a field programmable gate array i think is what fpga stands for and the difference is in fpga is programmable whereas an asic is locked in um and dji has these custom asics and when we say that the reason dji i said famously i will own this till the day i die i made a video saying that high definition fpv was nearly impossible and talked about all the reasons it was difficult and the gist of it was that it would cost so much money to develop a system to do it that it would not be worth it for anyone in fpv to do it and i stand by that dji came from outside fpv and made it happen by putting among other things just tons of money into developing these asics so when we talk about the click bait title what fat shirt needs to do to beat fat shark is using these divi math systems right right now yes so what i'll tell you is david that i talked with the owner of fpv blue claims that they are already using a custom asic so they originally used the diva math asic which is the at chip at936x i believe that's one of the at chips he thinks that they are already using a custom asic it's just not that great it's basically what he says is a poor asic you know um it's unfortunate it isn't asic is basically what he says okay fair enough we'll take him his word there we don't really know yeah um and so that's the unfortunate thing is kind of what they need to do is actually develop a new asic they spent money on the asic that they already made and it's likely that it doesn't have any room for improvement noticeably enough to be you know like you're not going to buy a better camera and suddenly it's going to be 20 better because the asic is a limiting factor based on coding and and d encoding and the one thing i'll say is you know obviously the interview is an hour long but one thing he talks about is if you just do the math for how much it takes to encode a signal that's 720p and send it over the air at 55 or 60 frames a second it's like 55 gigabits a second so you have some compression and obviously they're doing some compression of that signal and it depends on how good their other side is to get that latency out and it seems like that's the issue is just the asic can't do the work enough to pull it back into a nicer signal and you get what you get yeah the amount of work being done to make a high definition low latency fpv link is is ridiculous as soon as you start opening it up and you see what they're really doing it's it's it's extraordinary um uh but uh you've got this interview with him where you talk about the history of fpv blue he's now is fpv out of business now yeah he's totally done totally done yeah didn't make it i talked about you before his time i asked him if his uh technology is applicable and stuff you know we kind of go over everything to different companies and that sort of thing so i'll just say that his uh his most exciting thing in the industry right now he thinks is orca hd because it's going to be open and they're working with some good people so yeah it'll be interesting yeah orca is uh working on supposedly they say working on a digital fpv system and people are like where is it and uh recently the ceo of orca was on facebook saying look we're gonna release it when it's ready we're not gonna jump the gun and release it early i wonder who he could be referring to so um yeah so it should be very interesting there is linked down in the show notes in the video description below uh there's an hour-long interview on blunty's channel and uh i haven't watched it yet but i'm going to watch it because it sounds like there's some really interesting stuff in there yeah all right let's see here we have got some community spotlights coming up community spotlight means that we focus on a small project being done by an fpv community member that we think deserves additional attention and the first place we're going to start is with this series of videos this guy's name is chris rosser he came out of nowhere i've never heard of him before and he is like a cad engineer a materials engineer i don't know what his title is and he my name's chris i'm an arab he said oh there you go he's an aerothermal engineer what's up blintzy go ahead so he's actually taken requests um he actually released a video about 30 minutes before we went live on on the armatan marmot and everybody's been complaining about armatan um if you really oh i can say from personal experience if you release a video talking about resonance and oscillation in the on the on on an armatan frame uh it's gonna it's gonna get a provoke a response from the owner of armatan well i'll tell you what um i'd love to see him release some actual science because this is some actual science to show you what's wrong yeah check this out well this is now this is the source one yeah this is the source one yes the first one is before um so he goes through and looks at what are called resonance modes so essentially as you hit each level of resonance you're going to have a mode in which the quadcopter resonates and so he's showing at each of these levels what's happening to the quad so you can see here the arms are moving but the gyro isn't necessarily moving even though the arms can move wildly now this is super um this is just to show you what would happen yeah it's super exaggerated this is like like quarter of a millimeter like very tiny movements that are happening um but this is kind of show you the idea but as he gets up in residence modes he kind of explains you know what's happening so let's see here we got a different resonance mode this is on the roll axis and is causing this weird roll movement that will affect the gyro you can see the gyro flipping back and forth 227 hertz oscillation they're moving sort of mostly on the yaw axis and he's talking about how that won't affect the gyro um but he goes on to show a frame that he designed i'll fast forward here he's designed this frame and and he's i don't know what his experience is in frame design like as i look at this on some level i'm like well you know there's a there's like i think these arm braces look like they may be a little thin like i wouldn't want to take a hit on a concrete pole but he's thought a lot about the resonance characteristics and his argument is that this frame has like the optimal resonance characteristics yeah so basically his idea is that most people are running some sort of low pass filter even if you've got one left on you've got one low pass filter above like 300 or 350 even if you've cut out most of your filters so if you've done that he's moved his resonance up because you're going to have some residence somewhere you've got to have some response yeah yeah so his thought was let's move him up so he's put them up near the top of the spectrum so your low pass will start to cut them out automatically and you're not going to see them in your logs and you're not going to see them in cloud performance because your filters are going to filter them out even with the lowest filtering you would typically use i i'm super excited to see people applying like when we talk about mark spatz uav tech applying science to pid to pit and flight controller analysis there are a lot of people who i think you could criticize a scientific approach and say here are some things you overlooked here are some things you could have done better but i don't think you can criticize the principle that a scientific approach is the right way to advance knowledge and advance the state of the art and the technology so i think it's really cool and i i don't know how many other frame designers like i know people do find an element analysis to look for weak spots in the frame and to optimize the weight i've never seen anyone doing this kind of resonance analysis on frames before cue the people coming out of the woodwork in the comments to say they've been doing it for years i think this is really freaking cool yeah in the modeling the way he shows it and explains it i think is really cool um i think that's part of the best part of these videos like i said he does the marmet and the thing i find fascinating is that he basically goes and looks at the log and says okay there's a band at 250 hertz so i'm expecting to see a resonance mode there he jumps over looks through the resonance modes and finds a horrible resonance mode right around 250 hertz that he can show you and explain what's wrong and then he goes through the frame design and explains why he thinks that this is happening and things they could do to change frame design to stop these resonance boats from happening and his basic take away from the marmet was just that the problem is the arms are too wide whether because that's good for crashing but they're only four millimeters thick so if they were thinner and four millimeters it might be okay or if they were thicker and and wider it would be okay but it's because of the wideness with the thickness they have that creates the resonance interesting yeah there's um a lot of people so a lot of people fly the armatan marmot and the same thing i think was true in the chameleon a lot of people fly it have no problem and love it it's one of the most popular freestyle frames out there no one can take that away but a lot of people do fly it and have problems with mid-throttle oscillation specifically and have there been questions whether there's and i've noticed like a 200-ish hurts resonance frequency on it when i worked on it so um what i'll say is the one of the main i would say a lot of people aren't going to notice this if you fly stock like if you just fly stock filtering you're not going to see it because the filtering is just going to filter it out um if you start to cut filtering like if you do a uav tech tune or a crunk tune you start to cut your filters out and start to get that filtering down so you're improving prop wash and doing a real tune that's when you're going to start to see these things express themselves yeah so i'm psyched but i'm psyched about this he posted his analysis on facebook and i don't know if it was my comment that sparked this or if he but but i responded and said you know i would love to see you validate this by comparing an actual frame to blackbox data from the frame and like three days later he had done it and and it totally validates his approach because any time you're working with a simulator maybe your assumptions in the simulator are wrong and your results are bs but he's totally validated this approach so now what i want to see is i want to see him hook up with an actual like a frame designer because like ryan harrell came out in his facebook and he said you know if you radius these cuts at like a two millimeter radius then it would be easier to cut it with a bit on the cnc machine instead of having sharp edges and i was like this if he hooks up with a frame designer he could actually make a really cool frame yeah i am super excited yeah and i hope he keeps doing this for more frames and showing the resonance on the frames this is super great yeah he's he actually a lot of people a couple of people in chat have mentioned and i mentioned him immediately i was like you did a source one v4 but i want to see a source one v3 because that's the one i fly and a lot of people have great resonance on a source one v3 so he actually did that he did make a video on it but he sent me the data so maybe he'll throw a video together of the source v3 because that's a common one as well that people ask about well the source one was my suggestion because the the cad files are out there so he doesn't have to like he should just import the cad files and be good to go cool yeah all right discord is still there discord has been quiet for like uh seven minutes you still still live discord okay just checking we've got people don't request the frames from me i mean i guess he might be watching the stream you got to contact him go comment on his videos his links to his videos are in the video description below all right moving on yeah what do we got splakowski pablo spakowski has a pretty cool project he did a diy and also handsome so handsome oh hang on hang on hang on bloody blunty i muted you i'm sorry blenty i muted you how long has you how long has he been muted did it just mute him i just muted you blunty sorry i tried to bl i tried to mute the youtube video and i muted blunty too wait testing you're okay he's back wait wait for the chat to catch up the chat will catch up let's just double check here i'm alive blunty's back he's coming he's coming all right cool we can hear okay start over blunty um so i was just saying so pablo kelsey is an awesome creator i love pavel but one of the coolest things about powell in this video is how excited he gets to fly this freaking quad he is just jumping for joy to fly this thing he thinks it's so cool that it works and i just love that kind of thing like he's making stuff that's fun for him to to fly it's like a passion project um that's the that's my favorite kind of projects and uh this is no exception this is really cool man it does the same things a lot of the same things the dji fpv drone does it just or the dji fpv motion controller does it just uses um his buddy box to the radio yeah so it's just exporting ppm signal to the radio and that's being translated um you're not hearing the video clip just because i want to let make sure blunty's being heard people in the discord are joking that i shushed you again blunty by uh by muting you sorry guys i was trying to mute the youtube video and i muted blunty by accident um this to me blunty feels like it goes i'm just gonna let the video play because it's so cool it feels to me blunty like this goes back to the heart of what fpv hobbyists hob the fpv hobby look how happy he is was about like it's been a long time since you were really hacking something together and that's cool it's cool to just be able to buy parts from a store and build a drone and fly it and enjoy it but but but seeing this 3d printed prototype hand soldered doing a super cool thing it really does my freaking heart good honestly yeah it's really cool it's it's just really cool and it works so well like i mean you know threw it together it's a esp-32 board and he put an mpu 6050 gyro on it um he's eventually going to add some gps stuff to it so he can get a location he's going to make better throttle and stuff but it's a cool little project i wanted to point out he's so happy he's so happy to unmute him for a minute yeah look what a great time to unmute oh that's so great now i will say it's a little different it is a little different than the dji drone um the dji fpv drone the way it works is it actually puts a target in the in the goggles a little dot on screen and you move the drone by moving the target as the drone flies so you can like just put the dot on a gap you want to shoot and the drone will try and fly through the gap you're not directly controlling the drone whereas he's like directly controlling the drone by tilting his hand so still still some room for improvement i guess yeah but uh really slick all right well pavel as and as i said such a handsome guy i only say that because people say that we look alike excuse me they say he's the polish joshua bardwell i can see that i can see the resemblance all right didn't want anybody think i was making fun of it see look it's not let's see the resemblance what are the advantages compared to a regular remote shut up it's just cool it's just cold it's fun did you see pablo would you see how much fun he was having there are there are reasons why you might want a one-handed uh because it if you think about control systems control systems typically start by giving you direct control over the the system and then slowly evolve away from you having direct control to you so instead of saying i'm going to control each individual drone motor you say i'm going to have a gyro and a flight controller in a pid loop and i'm going to tell it how i want it to rotate so you've abstracted yourself away from the control system slightly so what this motion controller is doing is it's taking you one step more abstract so instead of saying i'm going to control the individual axes you're saying i'm just going to move it how i want it to move and there's reasons why that might make sense in addition to just being super cool yeah um let me get a couple more super chats out of the oh out of the way valenti just just going to say people are pointing out this is a great thing for one left fpv the guy who flies with one hand and these are this is a pretty cool solution for people who don't want to learn to fly like that or yeah other people with disabilities who just want to have different options pretty neat yeah yeah um let's see mossberg thanks for a 10 super chat thank you joshua and blunty both of you have been very helpful love the content and keep up the great work robin duckett five pounds in the super chat thanks for the content i enjoy flying around your garden and off yeah it's really great it's a really great simulator um anytime i think maybe it's maybe i should move one of the things on the on the no list is but but i'm in lift off i can't move i don't want to uh if you've never looked in the window go look in the window yeah the side window in my house i'm there yeah um chris patterson cinema thank you for a five dollar super chat is the part 107 exam current with the faa's new ruling i'm taking the test friday i wonder if they have questions on flying at night etc good question chris do you know blunty for yeah as far as i know it's current is not current right now they haven't released a new one so you'll still get the old one then when the new one comes active i think right now is april 15th the last i looked was when it will actually become active when that one becomes active then you can take a recurrency test that will be free for just the new stuff because you've gotten your old version of the license anyone who takes it anyone who takes it after april 15th will not have to take recurrency it'll be on the original uh the 107 they take but yeah you to do the new stuff you also take a recurrency test so just to do the new stuff to fly at night without waivers yes i do want to fly at night without waivers that would be nice yeah there's a company out there that their whole what part of their one of the products they offer is they'll help you get a night waiver this is going to really screw them over oh well yeah um and mr stubbs 12 thank you for that answer blendi i didn't know the answer so i'm glad you're here for many reasons but also that one uh mr subs 12 thanks for five dollars just thanks for all you do um okay let's see here uh the next community spotlight has to do with me um this guy he said he said i have a hologram drone hang on i'm gonna pause this video he said i have a hologram drone and i'll put your logo on the drone you can send me your logo i was like okay sure i really had no idea what he was talking about so he sends me this video and i have to we have to show it um i'm gonna play this now at first i doesn't i was like okay what is happening here okay i kind of didn't get it until i saw it in the daylight or the dusk light hang on one second it's gonna skip ahead what so it's a persistence of vision device right hanging under a drone that's pretty freaking badass that's pretty badass it's pretty cool it's yeah so this is like one of those um like you said the persistence division thing where like uh they spin a fan and then you have leds programmed to make the pattern i think yep um yeah pretty neat good idea i don't know why we haven't seen more of this but this is a smart idea yeah it is not a projector it is a spinning led array that is changing the color of the lights as the thing spins and the persistence of vision effect in your eyeballs causes it to look like it's there you go that's the last uh that's celestia it causes it to look like a single image it's pretty freaking cool so thank you for doing that uh who was that the link link to that video in the in the video description of course drones unlimited thank you very much for doing that that's a really cool thing um as far as flying billboards go i mean it could probably get it's probably gonna need to get a little bigger before we have a flag billboard but it's pretty freaking cool bad for life says that that turned out way better than anyone could have imagined i agree go ahead go ahead i'll just say so um yeah i just we're gonna move on to the next story i i'm really impressed with what these guys are doing taric runs cyclone fpv they've been pretty involved in the hobby in various ways but i really think this is super cool they basically have taken apart a dji drone and put together only the important parts of the drone and they're shipping it for free to their customers they just pay shipping and cover it when they ask you to return a piece of swag and basically you can activate your dji v2 goggles that need a drone by getting the ship to you so you get it shipped to you the same day you just take a video you activate the drone with it and get it all done your goggles will work fine with your air units and vistas after you use the drone to activate and you send it on to the next person in line yeah one of the one of the weird things about all these people who are having trouble activating their dji drone it are their dji goggles if you have the drone you just bind to the drone and the problem goes away but so many people don't have the drone so cyclone has number one just gone above and beyond for their customers they've gutted this drone so you know that's a 700 drone that they're not going to sell and they found a way to be able to send this out to their customers that the customers have no motivation to like steal it right because you can't fly it it's just the guts that you can use to activate and then the customer either sends it on to the next customer i think how's that how are they doing that plenty yeah right now i think there's enough people that want it that you basically just uh ship it ups to the next person i think max shipping you'll pay is like 15 bucks or so for the weight um and it'll cover insurance and stuff and yeah you'll just get it onto the next guy so so cyclone fpv gets the the chad of the month uh you know good guy of the month for for doing this for their customers um i have a video that i am going to release probably tomorrow i just recorded it today because i just got fed up seeing people say because blunty you found the solution where people could flash back to the old firmware dji made this possible and now it's not working people are saying in the comments that video i tried it didn't work what should i do there's no word from dji about how to fix it yeah and i'm going to release a video tomorrow with my opinion about that and a recommendation for who you should call and uh cyclone fpv has beat me to the punch they're like we're not waiting for dji to make it right we're going to fix it for our customers and at this point you know we're a couple weeks out from this release i cannot understand why we haven't seen any kind of firmware update like if they knew the rollback worked how have we not gotten a v101.01 that fixes this as well it's like no idea insane if they've identified this issue uh yeah it's just crazy i have no idea this is a this is a showstopper issue like you're selling 600 550 whatever dollar goggles to customers and the customers cannot use them i would be so angry to have spent that much money on a product that i and and like you need to be all hands on deck fixing this and it can't be that hard to fix right yeah it's not we know i mean it's not that you have to enable an option in firmware somebody needs to talk to the right engineer to flip the right switch so that you can click a button when you haven't activated it's not rocket science this isn't like it's just the bad chain of command it's a multi-billion dollar company who doesn't know how to talk to people it's bad support agents it's like the whole thing is just garbage it's just really garbage yeah and it's it's uh and so so um what i'm going to say in this video tomorrow nobody nobody's watching this live stream i'm going to say that people need to need to keep contacting dji support who is unfortunately useless because i mean the support engineers are not the problem they are just doing what they're told to do but there is no clear messaging to them to train them on what people need to do because there's no solution anyway so what can they they can't give you a solution that doesn't exist but i'm i'm going to argue that people should be contacting the store they bought it from and saying look i i you either need to fix this for me or you need to give me my money back or give me another set of goggles that will work because if i spent 600 on a set of goggles and they didn't work for two three weeks i would be livid and hopefully when when vendors start to feel the pressure then they will apply pressure back to dji maybe dji will listen to them but cyclone fpv beat me to the punch on that so yeah another thing to point out a lot of people are saying that like you know if you are having an issue where if you bind to an air unit or vista and then you switch to drone mode and it unbinds that is normal unfortunately that's how it works and that is uh also another thing that's like super easy to fix it seems like or something they should state is not fixable uh because that's a big thing for people if you're switching back and forth and you own both devices you kind of like people are buying two goggles that's insane no i've talked to multiple people that have two pairs of goggles just so they can bind to all their quads on one because they have eight quads they don't want to rebind to all their vistas when they go out to the freaking field so they can also fly their dji drone or if you're like i'm at the field i want to fly this quad and then the drone and then this quad i'm re-binding over and over again it's insane i agree i mean it's easier than some things but yeah yeah all right um pilot extreme says just just buy the drone from amazon activate and then return the drone make sure the seller is dji that's actually i mean it hurts dji so yes i don't think uh dji fpv drone rc ritter and chat says i have two goggles just for that oh my god you guys i mean okay whatever i guess that's fine whatever that's ridiculous but that's fine you shouldn't have some people some people can't even rebound to the drone like they're having to like redo all the firmware and stuff to get the drone rebound after they come back from the air university side it's like it's just a mess this is unfortunately just a mess if you have 12 if you have 1 300 to spend to to to you'll get it back but if you have 1300 you can buy the combo bind the drone and then return the whole thing and get your money back from amazon i mean that's a big freaking risk not many people may have that money i mean i don't know but um yeah that's a workaround i'm not going to recommend it because i feel like i don't know but yeah uh thank you very much to people who was it who said if you're in arizona let me know noisy boys garage if you know someone who has the drone they can help you solve the problem yeah yeah anyway let me get a couple more super chats here before we finish out we're going a little long tonight but i bet i bet that chat won't mind uh russell katzner thank you for 20 super chat just wanted to say thanks for all the content information and entertainment uh thank you very much for the super chat russell katzner when is dji gonna address it joe reagan i don't know i don't know we can we can only imagine if ever who knows kenny smooth x says i just bought the dji goggle v2 it should get here in two days is there something i shouldn't do so i don't experience the problem no kenny um the problem when you get the goggle out of the box you will be led down a path where you up you activate the goggle you update the firmware and either you will get to the end of that path and everything will be fine or you will hit a stumbling block where you cannot proceed like it will refuse to activate or it will say please connect to the defeat the dji drone in order to activate you'll be like but i don't have that um so there's nothing you it just depends on the state of the goggle that you get and most people are fine but there's nothing you can do to make it better or worse so that's good news yeah all righty uh let's go ahead blunty uh uh would you talk about the oh my god we got like four topics left jeez i thought we were gonna run short today but i guess not uh the longest drone flight on record and when you said this i was like what like one two hours no 13 hours how did they go 13 hours man 13 hours and four minutes so they went 205 miles on a little trip here and basically they did this with an auxiliary fuel tank that converts gas into electricity so essentially this is a gas electric hybrid drone and this company has been developed for the sole purpose of building a long flying drone that can stay in the air for these 13-hour flights you know they they show in the video they take off right before sun sunrise and they land after sunset yeah gas electric hype i mean there's no no way to really beat the energy density of gasoline uh there's a lot of things wrong with gasoline and liquid fuels but they they really are very dense you certainly could uh build full electric drones with massive batteries but the problem is that those things are getting into a size range where they're they're practically full scale aircraft and you're not going to just like oh i'm just going to have my search and rescue crew put one up you're talking military application um so gas electric put a couple gallons of gas on there run a little generator charge up your batteries as you fly pretty freaking slick yeah yeah one of the things they talk about is like you said for a police department or search and rescue fire department something like that to just put this thing up and have it up all day you know you have one thing up all day that's just taking care of everything as watching the area is coming back and forth you're not having to bring it back land it find places that are safe like yeah there's so many different things that you can avoid um i just haven't up there the whole time another advantage that i wouldn't have thought of until i talked to some people who do search and rescue these guys they have a lot on their mind they have a lot of training to keep up with the ability to simply pour gasoline into a tank and start the drone is some like they don't have to really learn about lipo safety like you have to if you're if you're dealing with lipos and you can instantly refuel it and be ready to go it's pretty slick yeah super cool um yeah so new record anybody want to beat the record 13 hours and four minutes that's the goal i mean it's going to get beat yeah it seems like this is just their like current attempt but i'm sure they can squeeze more out of it dominic clifton says i hope the motors have good bearings that's a good point dominic i mean chances are that many multirotor motors are not designed to operate for 13 hours at a time and you may you may encounter some failure modes that you wouldn't have expected under normal operation yeah uh gas fire if you crash though so there's that twin turbo staying you're not wrong uh you would want this on an octo probably so it would have some redundancy all right let's move on um so there was some lawsuit yeah there's some basically so what might be some precedence set in michigan by an appeals court by the michigan state court of appeals basically uh the police used a drone to fly over um a local residence of this couple and it was a really messy backyard and stuff it was a large backyard so they flew over the the the yard at like 300 feet 400 feet like right under the ceiling where they're allowed to they took a bunch of pictures and they brought them to court and the court ruled that this is not the same as a plane a plane could fly over and take pictures but a drone is considered different to photos from an aircraft because an aircraft is less likely to loiter is much higher and generally moves at a much greater speed so drones are considered in this case by one of the judges these they said to be intrinsically more targeted in nature than airplanes this sets kind of a different precedent that we've been hearing for a long time which is that you know you don't own the airspace above your house and you have some right to privacy but you know it's similar to an airplane things like that and we're seeing in this case we had two judges to one um say that essentially is not like an airplane drone should be treated differently and this was a trespasser violation of privacy and so they have to throw it out because they did not have a warrant to be on the property this feels like a win in but i worry about the because a lot of the times um rc aircraft pilots get to get to kind of come under the umbrella of full-scale aircraft and people say you can't fly over my yard and they say well look the national airspace you know you don't have the right and and i can fly over your houses i'm legally allowed to fly over your house you know not legally allowed to like look in your windows and whatever you're scared of me doing but passing over your house is fine just like as if i was a helicopter just like as if i was a plane and if you're going to have a precedent that says well actually drones are a little bit different at first it sounds like yo police shouldn't be able to spy on me with a drone i like that outcome i'm a little worried about the precedent it sets yeah um luckily this can still be appealed i don't know if they're planning to take it to a higher appeals court or not but if they did and it went to the federal court it's possible that the faa could get involved and there could be different considerations here because currently this is just michigan state handling this so if the federal government looks at this and says hey this airspace i don't really care what you say you know that sort of thing it depends on how this all works out right yeah i mean certainly you could argue there's a way to kind of split that difference you could say a drone is an aircraft and is regulated by the faa exactly like any other aircraft however there are different types of aircraft and this particular type of aircraft it's not okay to spy on people with so but i feel like that nuance may get lost yeah anyway very very interesting a couple of people are saying this is about not having a warrant but my understanding is it's about not having a warrant because it's a trespass violation of privacy so that's the concern like i don't need a the police i'm not a lawyer but uh my understanding is the police don't need a warrant if if like if there's something in your front yard and you can just see it from the street they don't need a warrant for that and typically you would not need a warrant to fly an aircraft over someone's house and take pictures of stuff that was visible from the backyard because the national airspace is seen as public in the same way that being on the street is seen as public so they didn't have a warrant they didn't think they needed a warrant and one of the three judges on the appeals court did decide on that side and said that the airplane should be it should be considered like an airplane um you can't just basically they were worried about setting precedent is what it sounds like and they were worried that like you can't just blankets say that a drone is different than an airplane because you feel like it's different i guess they wanted more evidence in the case or more things to show that and they felt precedent had been set for a plane standard and that's what they went with so it's interesting to see it was two to one not unanimous as much as this might feel like a win if it does stand the only thing that's going to happen is next time they'll get a warrant and they'll do the exact same thing so it's not like oh yeah we're free our backyards are safe anyway i'm gonna have to go get those uh i'm gonna have to get some stuff out of my backyard after this live stream so um we'll have to finish up pretty soon everybody knows what's in my backyard um all right cool um one more two more two more things uh this is the one for the people who have the iflight beast h7 and they're trying to get bi-directional d-shot working and rpm filtering working and as soon as you enable bi-directional d-shot motor number three stops working is that right blunty that's what i'm hearing yeah yeah basically yeah on 4.3 or any other betaflight version if you don't run bl heli-m 16-9 for some reason that one will fix this issue on 4-2-6 you can run 16-9 via heli-m and that will correct correctly run bi-directional d-shot and report properly if you run 4.3 betaflight they've made a change to the h7 code and essentially the way they've built the board they're claiming that there is some physical issue and that prevents them from properly using the beta flight code and betaflight's not changing it so unfortunately if you upgrade to 43 you lose the ability to bi-directional d-shot no matter what firmware you run on the esc i'm so confused by this and dominic clifton i know you're participating over in the github uh conversation about this so maybe you can chime in but excuse me i'm confused about this because it sounds like how could the if the if the flight controller is not outputting d-shot correctly how could the esc fix it sort of doesn't make sense sounds like it's outputting a d-shot signal that is in some way kind of messed up and some esc's will pick it out and some will go that's no good i don't want it yeah maybe it's about size or transmission speed or something that changes in 16.9 yeah i'm not super clear on what's different there but i have confirmed with another user i think we fixed this for another user and it did work for them to flash 426 and 16.9 um running in different versions of jesc and different esc firmwares they were actually seeing the wrong rpm filtered number they were getting a hundred times the rpm number so they were getting 300k instead of 3k and that was like scaling up as they would go up so something is going on there yeah i i would say even if i mean i'm i'm i don't like to screw around i need my esc's like my batteries to be as reliable as possible uh when yeah an esc if it like says oh you want me to spin the motors okay like that could go really bad so even if like the esc seemed to be working i'd still feel a little bit uncomfortable with this situation yeah and another concern is that unfortunately this means that in 4-3 is the only way you can use a barrow the barometer on this board because it uses a special barometer and so if you flash back to 426 you can't use the barometer okay unfortunately so just real quick bad for life in chat is saying 69 still gave me the error on esc3 make sure you're on 4.2.6 and on 16.9 because i did have a user try to uh a debit user successfully fixed that last night um so yeah f7b does run fine as well this is a h7 implementation book right so iflight unfortunately i think that's not really going to be a fix because they have they'd have if you have an affected board dominant clifton says yeah they buggered up their fc design that uh seems to be what some people are saying anyway if it is a hardware issue in the board then there isn't really going to be a way to fix it maybe work around it with specific betaflight versions or something specific bl heli versions but ultimately if you have that board you basically are going to have to jump through some hoops to get rpm filtering working or not or not use rpm filtering working and that's their statement i flight statement on their website currently is um basically our b stage 7 is being updated to a v2 if there's a solution for h7 and bles if they can figure that out what they did wrong um or if not they'll just upgrade it to bl holy 32 so they don't have this issue which i thought was interesting what that's what they should do anyway right blt32 is better just costs more but who cares so yeah i don't want to get into it but is it really better it has more it has more options sure i i feel like music is the variable pwm frequency and startup music yeah it's better blend variable pwm frequency variable like well dynamics dynamics now we're getting actual dynamic yes that's true mike bergman i did ask dominic clifton about the osd on the on the iflate he says they all support osd he doesn't know what you're talking about i didn't uh mike dominic clifton the question i had in chat earlier about the osd on the b stage seven uh that was mike bergman he's now outed himself you guys can argue about it if you want to he says he says you're wrong mike and you also you're you're you're dumb and you look funny i mean that's paraphrasing he did not he did not think he didn't say it all right um okay one more thing here israel gets serious about drone delivery drone delivery commercial drone applications uh everybody knows it's coming but nobody's actually doing it yet but israel apparently is getting ready tell us about it yeah they've done some testing they're doing pretty small scale testing right now but they've basically built a control room 35 miles away from the test center they have an air traffic control style center set up with tracking for each drone each drone is required to have gps trackers on them they're also required to have parachutes failsafe systems things like that um so that if something happens they're not going to fall on somebody or break anything hopefully i thought it was pretty interesting because they're trying to do this like air traffic control and they're saying like this is what we're going to need to do when we have drones in the air you can't just rely on the drones to all handle themselves so they're actually using a central control station to make sure everything's kosher and like sending out data and calling people and making sure everything's correct making sure this all works it's pretty slick pretty slick very innovative country it is real a lot of a lot of new technology coming out of there for such a small country pretty surprising who knows when we'll see something like that in the united states yeah patrick o'neill says i don't think drone delivery is happening i think it's just a gimmick i i could yeah i i i hear you we'll see make sure it's kosher lol israel thank you cans on quads on that note uh we will wrap up thank you guys so much for coming out blunty uh anything uh you wanna blunty's channel linked in the video description of course will here every tuesday at six i think i think also in the title now i think you can just click the title of this live stream and my i have like a there's a highlighted link to my channel now i think that's blunty yeah and yeah i've got that new interview with fpv blue so make sure to check that out um yeah i had a lot of fun doing that is jb getting confused between iflight and sp racing no dominant clifton i don't think so mike bergman was talking about the sp racing h7 i'm pretty sure not that i would never get confused but i don't think so sorry i just want to make sure dominic knows i'm not confused how embarrassing if i called out the wrong name um so if you haven't done it make sure you subscribe to this channel it's right under here it takes one click if you want to do another click you can hit the thumbs up button that's pretty easy um and we appreciate you guys being here oh good news yeah you came up with a ton of content i sent you a few of those things there was a ton of content it's now we've gone almost a half hour longer so people are getting a lot more value for their money but that is going to do it we're going to sign off uh and um we'll see you back here sunday at 1 pm is my next live stream uh and uh yeah that's it blunty you should you've kind of stopped live streaming is that right yeah i think i'm just going to do content and hang out with other people that's that's pretty much the plan all right well that's going to do it for us we're out of here have a good night everybody thanks guys", "zfF1rYZC3Tk": "hey what's up youtube alex here back again with another video and hey rya's finally got some select elite oil cartridges turn that down a little bit yeah select elite oil cartridges [Music] live oil this is the birthday cake strain select elite enhanced live resin cartridge i'll explain to you in a second what that exactly that means because some people do not know what that means there's all the information now i did open this got a little button on the side you press push down on the top and the cart slides out i already took it out put it on my pen and they give you across the bottom which is kind of cool right here they give you a little sticker that goes you you could put around the bottom of your cartridge like that i don't know there's the oil select elite live enhanced live oil this is birthday cake and yes this is coming in at 93 percent thc and uh you guys know me i would not [ __ ] you this cartridge is strong very strong matter of fact it's so strong but i forgot to put my microphone up close to my neck so yeah very strong cartridges select elite now what enhanced live oil is is they use um cannabis uh distillate which thc distillate and they put live resin terpenes mixed with it so it tastes really good uh you guys know i always say hey i should have bought two of them i was gonna buy two of them but i didn't guess what i bought two of them yes i had to pull the trigger i bought two of them and i'm glad i did because this cartridge is fire it is very potent very strong and tastes very good the uh birthday cake live resin terpenes absolutely delicious they had this cart filled up to the tippity top very tippy i've already smoked on this cart twice now and it's still that full now i guess some people had good experiences with these cartridges and some people may have had bad experiences but i'm sure glad that i've had a good experience with them this is a hybrid indica hybrid birthday cake boom two of them these are 60 bucks a half gram at rise erie in erie pennsylvania which is a medical marijuana dispensary uh yeah this brand has been around for quite some time and i've been dying to try them i've heard lots of good things about them they are a highly faked cartridge also you could put a lot of street cartridges these are these are like fake like cookies and other brands king pen select elite is highly fake cartridge so cheers let me get a hit that was my phone ringing you know just winging it here we just wing these videos nice flavor it's not real strong terpy like a moxie card or prime car you know how they're real terpy those carts are but it's got a nice terpy flavor but it's not like real terpy you know how moxie's are or even pharmaceutical x their cartridges are all very good nice terpene flavor you know they're real prominent this is more subtle but it's still very very good and with the potency you guys know i've told you before i would not [ __ ] you i've been smoking dispensary stuff cartridges for three years now i've been smoking marijuana and in the marijuana game for about 30 years that's right i'm 47 years old i've been smoking weed since i was 17 and in the weed game business since then trust me this is a strong fire cartridge i am very impressed by it it's got the nice little they're kind of made just like terrapin the same kind of tips and stuff like terrapin has it's got a sweet earthy kind of hazy it's a very good taste and the oil is super thick you said this is like i said i've already smoked on this cartridge look how full it is still it's still damn near full i smoked on it last night i hit it like four or five times it was potent like i said it's an indica hybrid 93 percent thc and that is every bit of that there and i'm so glad that i grabbed two of them at rise with my discount it came to 108 bucks for the two cartridges so that was 54 dollars a piece they are pretty pricey same as like a moxie you know or or prime prime is also 60 a half gram but those are live resins that's why they tasted this is an enhanced hence you get the word enhanced live resin oil so remember that it's very good but remember it's it's distillate with live resin terpenes so that's why they call it an enhanced live resin but don't make no mistakes is very good and it's very high potency at 93 percent so yeah i would give this definitely a thumbs up right now i can tell you that and cheers yeah i'm impressed on how full it was this cart was filled to the top i smoked on it last night like i said and it's still it was filled i hope the other one is just as filled that i got there's another look at the packaging select elite birthday cake indica hybrid rise erie erie pennsylvania got these they just got these in uh march 1st um so i hurry up around over there and grab me a couple of them this is the only strain they had was the birthday cake strain so if they had a different one i would have grabbed you know a different flavor but i had to grab just because it was so 93 percent thc and it is there like it is there he said i wouldn't [ __ ] you guys you guys know i've been smoking and i've been dabbing doing this for a long time these are strong and good cartridges i would put them up there just because of the potency right up there with moxie prime pharmaceutical rx they're right up there might not be as terpy but they're definitely up there with potency they're even higher these are strong like it's coming i hit that what two or three times and i could already feel it coming on cheers guys like i said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section give me a little thumbs up

great weekend", "Yp9_RQyQSck": "[Music] what's good y'all isaiah lilly again here with respect my region today we'll be doing some products from the high road their local company from my side in eastern washington up in deer park washington we got their blue dream here today nice sativa dominant hybrid uh pretty legendary strain along the west coast we got across the blueberry and haze here let's check out what we got so they're calling we got sweet and yummy berry flavor giving you a relaxed feeling that's pretty on par with what you'll hear from blue dream some people will say it's a little more energetic form but usually you'll hear it's a pretty relaxing good easy going strain very popular popular among uh medical patients and stuff like that for various reasons look at that a big old top nug right there good old christmas tree and yeah getting that real sweet berry aromas good good smell nice density too on the nugs which is always great to see especially with the sativa dominance you can sometimes get a little wifey with them um i got my bong here so let's go ahead and break some down see what we got going on [Music] yeah and definitely so i'm liking the cure good dense snugs not too dry though also not too wet easy to break down perfect for rolling up blunt joint packing the bong honestly this is really easy to work with and kind of what i like to see when i'm going for my weed [Music] not as sticky as i would you know like not super sticky but also like not not sticky like this is so far so good on this uh really would just hope for some good clean ash and a good taste so we're gonna see what we can get from the bong and then i also have a joint here to try i like to do the joints for the taste i believe you get a better profile off of those than you do really anything else unless you're smoking dab which i don't have a rosin press so we cannot do that with this all right shout out to high road for the ashtray and the lighter always need those all right we're gonna start with a big old rip see what we can get [Music] nice so super smooth hit like literally not wanting to cough at all um taste is pretty good little berry a little sweet i couldn't get it didn't get like too too much if you know like anything crazy that i haven't had tasted before um really the big thing on that is just how smooth that was that was a really really easy hit to do let's do one more before moving on to the joint see we can get a better look at the ash [Music] ash is still a little black but you know i haven't had a chance to rip it too much i do see some light gray coming on in the corner right there um but really i feel like if i were to keep smoking it it would it would start to turn that light gray white ash that we're looking for just because of how smooth that is that is really like one of the smoothest weeds that i've had hitting this bong that has like i don't want to cough at all uh really good solid in terms of that sense let's go over to our joint now um i like to get a good profile taste on joints i feel like you just get like i said earlier you just get a better overall exp um experience on that and bongs are great for feeling the high enjoy so great tasting the weed yes you can say i'm rich [Music] oh yeah like already that kind of sweeter berry yeah just yummy there's just good overall flavor really coming through on [Music] this yeah that's really nice really good smoke this like good kind of mouth feel to it it just has like the smoke it just kind of it fills your lungs it's very very full body smoke which is always nice i hate when you feel like you're puffing on a joint just to get like a what feels like a fourth of a hit this is coming in really really nice [Music] a very nice ash is graying up now i see again on this again it's so smooth this is been really nice smoking so far so with that based on everything that i've experienced now you know and taking in their packaging and all that into account i'd give this a solid 7.6 i would have to say um it's not like blowing me out of the water in terms of other blue dreams that i've had it is a strain that i'm sure like many of us i know i've smoked a lot of it i've had other cuts that i would feel are definitely maybe a little more potent on the high a little more quick sitting but in terms of the quality of the smoke the taste how smooth it was if it was flushed well i can see we're getting good gray ash on the joints so i believe it was flushed very well and their branding is cool pretty simple straight to the point which is i do like that they don't uh show off a lot on the side so it's kind of hard to tell um who they are maybe but that does allow them to show case their bud which so far we've seen nothing but big old nugs so why not want to show those off there's the top of their jar nothing crazy pretty simple so i would have to say yeah 7.6 all with everything in consideration and uh yeah that'll wrap it up i'm gonna have a few more products coming from these guys we got some other buds here we got us reviews so stay tuned and get ready to check it out go watch the full review on other reviews on the respect my region [Music] youtube", "brr3rNRJpYQ": "[Music] so [Music] hey guys it is claude brown from guitar lessons 365. classic ac dc for you today we're learning how to play it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll so this one is a bit it's i mean they haven't played this live since pretty much the 70s uh and after bon scott died they just never played it live again because it's kind of his signature song so in honor of them they never did it again so um it's got some interesting things about it it's in the key of b-flat and they did that to match the drone of the bagpipes um so they probably just tuned their guitars up a half step everything i don't like doing that i don't like tuning my guitars up so um i'm just using a capo to kind of match the picture which is probably what you're going to want to do too when they played it live though they just played it in a so they basically played it how i'm going to teach it to you here about everything down really a fret really just because it's really they just played it down a half step live in the regular a so it's kind of played like it's in a but since we have a capo it sounds like it's in b-flat so um if we want to match the recording we're gonna have to have this but like i said live they just did away with it so if you're not playing wrong with the record you could just go and move everything down um a fret and you'll be good to go so let's uh before we get into it please subscribe to the channel if you have not already ring that notification bell so you know release a new video and very important if you

trial to it um and like i said that is the best way to support what i do here on youtube because i could not do all these free song lessons on youtube every week if i didn't have my academy all right so please go check it out all right so let's jump into the track so like i said we are in i'm in standard tuning but i got a capo at the first fret just for us to be able to play along with the original recording so um now it's a pretty simple song but there's little intricacies to it that you can do throughout the song to kind of make it sound closer to the original so when we have this opening riff so when malcolm young first comes in with this we have a little bit of a pattern that he's doing with it at the very beginning and i'm also going to bring in a little other thing that you don't see a lot of people doing when they play it which means he's incorporating the low e string in there as well and kind of so we'll talk about that in a second so let's get that riff going first so what that rip basically is is you can play the open d and the open g string and then hammering on the second fret now when i'm saying the second fret i'm meaning the second fret above the capo there all right um when i get up here and i'm start i'm teaching the solo and all that stuff i'll just call out the actual frets because that's a lot it's nowhere near the capo so it's easier that way but here when we're down here i'm just when i say second fret i'm meaning second fret up front of the capo so therefore when you want to take it down take the capo off you'll just move down to the actual second fret so we have this so that first one we started with the open d and g and hammered on those two notes on the d and the g string of the second fret and then and then we just kind of hit the chord then a couple mutes on the a string and then hit that chord again and then what we do is we do the riff again but we don't start it with the [Music] he just goes and hits the chord he does that twice so one time with the hammer on two times without it and then the fourth time with the hammer on again so that's kind of the opening pattern that he does so we have this and then he repeats all that again so that's kind of what you're hearing when he's opening the song but you're also going to hear a low e string in there now he's not hitting the e string every time so it's that is kind of a random thing but basically instead of chugging along with just the a4 he's incorporating kind of muted to instead of muted hits on the open a it's muted hits on the opening it's really the only time you're going to hear him do it that loud and just because kind of in the intro you can hear him incorporating that low e string in there i don't think it's that big of a deal where you put it because it's it's not really he's not really doing a pattern to it i think it's more of a random thing that he's doing or you can kind of hit the a and the e together all right so that's what you're hearing in the intro and then after he's done that pattern twice then he pretty much does the hammer on every time and like i said when he hammers on those two notes when we get to the actual chord when he's hitting it he'll now sometimes make it a full major chord so you're gonna add that second from the b string you're not hammering on that note you're gonna hammer on those two and when you get there then you're gonna add when you're doing that part of it you're gonna add that second fret there above the capo on the b string so just the from from then on kind of starts now sometimes i think it's a hammer on sometimes he's actually picking it like i said it's kind of a random treatment that he's doing to it so you can kind of do what you want with it so as he's doing that angus starts to come in with this spill i believe here because it sounds like there's an open string um instead of just sort of that one sounds like it's an open string obviously we have capo here but i think he's doing his uh hybrid picking which he'll do a lot so when you slide into this is the fifth fret above the capo obviously the actual six front on the guitar here so you slide into that note then you're going to pick that note again while hybrid picking the open g string let's wear this slide there pick those two notes together and then go to the a power quartile all right so that's the fill that you're going to hear over that so then when we get to the verse it's kind of that same opening a lot of mostly the full a major chord there like i said it's a pretty simple song but those little intricacies that malcolm young threw in there that's what can make it a little bit challenging then we get to the pre-chorus which is the exact same riff except i call it the pre-chorus because things are kind of building underneath malcolm will play the young uh play the young malcolm will start playing the riff a little bit more open and then at the end he'll start really opening it up towards the end of this pre-chorus it's the same riff done four times but he starts opening it up but really the big difference between the pre-chorus and the verse is anger starts doing [Music] these starts doing these chord stabs on it so what is he doing here he's up here five frets in front of the capo so the actual sixth fret of the guitar you're gonna bar across that high e and the b string and you're also going to play there um the seventh fret on the guitar um there on the g string now obviously when you take the cable off and just play this in a but you're you just you move down the front to there okay so this so that's going on he starts doing that and i consider that when he starts doing that they're all kind of building up that's the pre-chorus and then we get to the chorus so so all right so that chorus starts with just the a chord first to the g chord now this is a g power chord [Music] [Applause] so it's a g chord in front of obviously it's an a flat if you want to be technical about it but we're in front of the capo it's just a g so this is an a chord in front of the capo and then so it's just like as we played it here but up a fret so what's going on here i'm playing the third fret about the capo on the high e and the b there's an open g string open d string and i'm also playing the third fret on from the capo on the low e now i'm muting that open a string with the bottom of that finger so that right there is a g power open g power chord very popular chord uh well well used chord in the ac dc lexicon um now what we're going to do is they also do this a lot where we're going to take this this chord we're going to move this note here back to the second fret above the capo and then play the second front above the capo on the g string and then the third fret above the capo on the b so what we're doing here if i'm playing that low e string i'm muting the a still with the bottom of that same finger open d second fret there okay from the capo on the g third fret of the capo on the b and then don't hit the high e string i'm kind of muting that with my pinky there so that's how angus actually plays that chord he you can play it like this well some people kind of will do it like like that just fine it doesn't matter i think just plays it like this so it's more better to be like angus so and then uh so then we go back to that a riff and then the same thing [Music] then let that a chord ring and then take it to a d [Music] [Applause] all right so all together for the course we have this so all right now we have this bagpipe section um coming into play and underneath that is just that a riff obviously it's b flat riff right now but so that's just what's going on underneath those bagpipes and then we have this sort of call and response section between angus i guess bond scott playing the bagpipes um and it's kind of like this we have [Music] this [Music] so i'll show you that's that's what angus is doing but i'll also show you kind of how to do the backpacks are doing the same little lick but an octave higher so i'll show you how to play that too so you can just kind of play those together if you're in a band obviously most people don't have a bagpipe player hanging out with thankfully those things are loud my brother played bagpipes it sucked they are the loudest instrument in the entire world you do not want to live with a bagpipe player just a little tip all right so we're going to play we're going to hammer 11 to 12 on the d string then over to 11 on the b that's the lick and then he'd go back kind of chug on the a couple beats and then back to do the same lick again all right so if you don't want to go back to that a you just want to do it the kind of mirror the melody that bon scott plays on the bagpipes there you can do the whole kind of call and response thing which is like this [Music] all right so that's that same leg but instead of going back to the a chord you can have this the rhythm guitar player uh do that you can jump up here and it's basically just just an octave higher i'm at the 16th fret there i'm sorry um 18th fret on the g string hammer on to the 19th fret then go over to the 18th fret on the high string all right now we get to these solos so coming out of that little call and response thing we have the solo work angus will play the chords and then they'll jump into the lick and then go back to the chords and stuff so i'm going to do that as well it's a fun solo to play pretty short so let's take a look at it [Music] hey [Music] all right so this is a fun one so it's cool going back around those floors taking a breather then going to this really digging into those licks so we start with the same uh kind of these chords that are in the chorus [Music] so that g that is basically a d with the f sharp in the bass and the a chord and then we have this first lick so i'm going to call this out just as the actual fret since we're far enough a row for the capo i'm not going to go what is 12 frets above the capo because that would be stupid so we have so what he's doing here is he this first look in the solo he's going to bend up a step and a half so you're going to make that 13th fret sound like the 16. and then he's going to bend that note again but this time only a whole step so it's going to solve the 15th fret so we have this and then so that right there is 11 13 on the b over to 12 on the g back to that 11 on the b back to that 12 on the g and back to the 11. slides that down so hear this [Music] all right then we do the same three chords again [Music] and he has this next lick so that is uh up to the 16th fret now you're going to do a whole step bend release that bin pull off to 14. then a couple more bins of the 16th fret on the b [Music] and then a pretty fast lick so that's going to play 13 16 13 on the high e string over to 16 on the b string and then you're going to pull off 14 to 13 on the beat so that's the only kind of pull off in there and then over to the 15th fret on the g string with a lot of vibrato on it [Music] so we have um [Music] all right back to the same three chords again and then we have this last lick here [Music] so that's going to start up here at the 18th fret on the b and the g string that double stop then over to the 20th fret on the d and then you do that again let's try this [Music] [Applause] [Music] then so that's a bend at that 20th front of the g string then you're gonna play 21 on the on the b string and then bend that again on the 18th fret on the g and pick it at the top of it and release the band at least that bin so just [Music] pull off to the 18th fret and then bend that 20th fret there again on the the g [Music] and then we're going to end the solo like this we're going to play 18 from a high e string roll over to 18 on the b then play 21 and bend that up a whole step and then kind of slide it sounds maybe a little bit up the g and then down it to the second fret there right in front above the capo [Music] now obviously if you play this like i think it's actually played where i think they probably just tuned their guitars up a whole step they probably didn't capo it couldn't really imagine angus using the capo but um we basically would have everything that you just learned there would be played a whole step i mean i'm sorry a half step lower so one fret lower than guitar so instead of going [Music] obviously will not match the recording but that's how they played it live in the 70s they played it just standard tune guitar open no capo and all that stuff so but like i said we're just trying to match the recording here all right so now after the solo um we go back into this it's kind of the same verse thing the same pre-chorus and then we get to the chorus again and the chorus is played pretty much the same but it's kind of an extended version of the chorus so we have this so everything's the same so far same stuff here do it right here it just now goes to that g the d chord with the x over the bass and the a add that at the end do it three times all right i forgot to turn off my uh overdrive pedal so then the this outro underneath the bagpipe section which eventually fades out has a couple of like three different guitar riffs under it that we have the first one we've seen before so it starts with that like i said sometimes you can do the hammer also no real pattern to it but as they continue that riff we have a couple of new riffs that start coming in there i think the bass player first does this riff and you know then then they start coming in the guitars but really low in the mix so you might not have ever picked it up or heard it before um but it is going on so let me play those two riffs back to back here so it sounds like this all right so those kind of things if you listen close to the recording you're going to hear that at the end especially as it starts to fade out so that first riff is just so that's just third fret in front of the capo fourth fret in front of the capo to the a chord obviously it's a b flat but we're going to call it a because it's a in front of the capo so just in that little rhythm on the eight like three beats there and then go back to the lick do this for a while maybe two bars so it kind of starts on the upbeat here we have this third fret in front of the capo on the low e string and when you play that third fret you can do a slight bend on it if you want so he does that like four times and then we go back down and hit the low east that third photo on the low e twice then the um power chord so basically that the fifth time you're gonna play like that sway this one four times so this fifth time hit the low east ring twice all right this kind of starts fading out and stuff all right so it is a fun song not very difficult to play got some tricky rhythms that's kind of a tricky rhythm at the end there coming up on on the upbeat and stuff um and of course the solo is not easy but it's a lot of fun to play once you get it under your finger so hope you guys enjoyed it i'll see you again soon for guitar lessons 365.com", "bN3lwiceqvo": "hey folks this is eric here with whatever guys whatever man do you want to know about the blue dream bait cartridge delta a thc vape cartridge from chill stick around for the video and i'll tell you more about that also if you'd be willing to

blue dream a little bit this morning already so um today uh so i'm gonna talk to you a little bit about the uh uh diamond cbd so i got these um i got a lot of cards from diamond cbd and i originally was not gonna didn't think i was gonna be able to do all of the uh reviews simply because uh diamond cbd my girl had ordered on thanksgiving day they didn't run anybody on friday didn't have anybody to work on uh saturday so they didn't actually run my order until the following tuesday and i actually got it the following thursday night uh they alluded on their site it was a two-day shipping uh for orders over a hundred dollars my girl definitely ordered over a hundred dollars uh barring that i was supposed to get a package yesterday which excuse me saturday from uh vapeful supply and i was supposed to uh you know they said it was late um so i ended up being able to do a couple more reviews on diamond cbd's now following up on uh today which is monday um i'm expecting the the order from vehicle supply however i got a message for youtube from one of my viewers and that person was telling me that uh they had you know supposed to get their order on the 23rd and you the united states postal service being what it is being slow covered in christmas and packages uh she still hasn't got her package so i'm not 100 sure let me get that package today from vapeful supply um and if i don't you know which is cool because show got saved and i can i can do the board reviews on chill brand uh by the way uh t-birds uh is somebody that uh comments on my videos all my videos man he talks to me back and forth quite a bit so when that order does get here for people supply they're sending me uh an extra card and i told you if i got a uh you know anything free that i would make sure i pass it on to my viewers um i'm putting it on the person that comments the most uh on my videos and that's t-birds so t-birds shout out to you bro when that uh order gets here from vapeful supply um i'll do a review and you'll know they're here uh you'll send me your address bro i'll send you out a cart from vehicle supply i'm not sure what the flavor is gonna be because uh obviously it's free but i don't see anybody complaining about that um okay so on to the blue dream if you've watched my videos before you know that um i'm i'm a big fan of blue dream uh blue dream treetop was my original uh favorite and then canada river came along with their blue dream um they kind of knocked that out of the park and i expected i had high expectations for this chill brand um blue dream simply because i had done a banana kush um and a couple of others i've done and apple fritter and those uh carts had an extremely good taste to them a lot of times what happens is when you get these carts is you'll hit them and then two or three times into them you're just not getting the taste anymore and maybe you'll set them down come back to them that first hit you'll get it again but you don't seem to get the taste anymore after that and that's what i was getting with the apple fritter and the banana kush and the mango kush i was actually getting a good taste throughout the whole uh experience i'm not getting that blue dream i'm kind of let down with the whole blue dream thing the blue dream is not um it's not quite as good as the other blue dreams that i've had before um i don't even think this is quite as good as the previous uh three cards that i've done from chill um you see it's uh i've used some of it trying to get to a point where um making sure that you know i was giving you guys a proper review on this it's a light high um the taste isn't you know it's just this is a mediocre cart compared to the previous three carts that i've tried so far um this is nowhere near the blue dream from treetop volcano river um i'm not sure uh what they did different on this car compared to the rest of them um i had two of these blue dreams so i did a little bit off the other one and some off this one to see um and they're both the same card uh i looked on the back of the package and they both come from the same lot um barring all that this is just not as good a card as the rest of them were um and you can see the consistency of it it's not to say that it's a bad card it just is not up to the standard of the other three carts that i tried is definitely not up to the standard of blue drink in canada river or treetop um so you folks take that as it is uh so anyway like i said at the end of the video if you stick around to the end if you'd like to subscribe stay around to the end i tell you how that you can win one of these uh vape carts and vapor supply this happens to be my favorite cart um they have a this is actually my favorite flavor from uh they pull supply um i'm gonna put a link

[Music] you", "QMH1pOMCS4k": "[Music] hey everyone jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com super excited today back with another west coast weed tour review 2020 edition today the steezy disposable vape pen i got it at the steezy store downtown la this is the disposable thc pen blue dream check it out i'm pretty excited i've never actually hit one of their products before i've tried their dabs i've tried some of their flower but never any other oils so you know i am a big vaper you got those of you who know me know my background know that i'm definitely a vapor it's been that way for a few years uh steezy a super popular brand here in california lots of influencers that part of only the coolest events um on their packaging let's let's go ahead and dive in shall we delta 9 thc is listed 443.57 milligrams total thc 88.71 total cbd this is cool 2.87 milligrams uh manufactured date july 25th packaging date july 25th so relatively fresh still super exciting batch number is listed uid numbers listed manufactured by ironworks collective incorporated that's steezy's license super cool it's got the warnings it says on the ingredients it does just say thc distillate and terpenes it doesn't differentiate which type of terpenes cannabis botanicals live resin who knows um on the back though this is pretty cool uh for many people don't know that i believe this desi has their own technology when it comes to their vaporizing device introducing the new generation of modern thc delivery systems steezy is revolutionizing the cannabis industry by creating a product that offers a discrete experience built for portability and convenience our premium quality concentrates uphold a high level of potency and purity steezy is setting the industry standard to influence and inspire through our innovative methods let's dive in no more [ __ ] here we go oh pull it out ripped it a little bit my bad we got the portable vape oh this is cool check this out it's got its own little battery we've got this beautiful gold oil in there for distillate traditionally a lot of people hate on decilit because it's not the highest quality of concentrates but it is the og of vaping so i'm pretty excited to check that out the stizzy etching and then the california etching there pretty sick all right y'all one hit i'm going to talk about it two hits we'll dive right into the rating system hundred points you guys know the rules west coast we toured let's get it honestly i feel like this little guy here is like the equivalent to the men in black noisy cricket that little battery here rips i was not expecting it to be ripping so uh intensely uh there's definitely an abundance of terpenes it was honestly got a little too hot for me to be able to fully fully like taste them right off the bat but after i blew out all the vape uh or out of you know all the ah it's working it's got me tongue tied i definitely feel like that hit got the job done two hits talk about the ratings here we go all right so this one has me thinking because this is tough you know traditionally i want to be a little bit tougher on distillate because it is not again the best like vaporizing type of concentrate like it it's good for that activity don't get me wrong but it's just not the highest quality so i'm trying to be fair in this keep it real let's go the scores i do like it presentation presentation super cool um well-branded it stands out on the shelf steezy lots of information on this i give them a 10 out of 10 on the presentation they definitely stand out stand out at most stores appeal they do the most to appeal and influence and inspire to the point where it's like you know some people find like what they do annoying myself i think they do set the standard for the proper way to go about it i wish they would diverse their influencers a little bit i would love to see more black brown uh you know varieties of asian people and and other native americans and things like that be utilized but that'll happen when the time comes color we've got a nice golden color there i don't know if you guys can fully see it but there's definitely some good gold color this is some nice looking distillate uh smell yeah you when you can smell the terps through the mouthpiece i think that's a good sign for the vapes for the vape category blue dream i can definitely smell this lemony blueberry there um gosh this is this is good presentation you know 10 out of 10 appeal 10 out of 10 color it definitely looks golden i don't know how this would look better than this 10 out of 10. the smell on this is there 10 out of 10 taste it just says terpenes so again i don't know if these are cannabis terpenes i don't know if these are all natural i don't know if these came from freaking blueberries or candy or whatever um the taste i'm gonna give it a nine just because that uncertainty has to where that tastes come from it does impact me uh potency i was already tongue-tied earlier potency for this it's an 88.71 thc it kind of hit me like a 90-plus got to give them that credit for that potency is there 10 out of 10. experience i'm honestly surprised at how well this hit it smacked me you already saw me [ __ ] up my talking i think it's undeniable that the experience with this is you know around the 9.5 9.25 but it's not because of the actual product here again it comes with the uncertainty i want to know what my ingredients are i want to know what it's actually made with and i want to know how long i'm supposed to hit it for it i could have hit it too long burned it at the beginning and then been too intoxicated initially right and at some point i like to just vape it and go casually and you know potentially be told hit it for five seconds seven seconds etc uh it's being picky but these are real things to think about lots of consumers care about this stuff experience i'm going to give them a 9.25 more information plenty of information available on this would still like some more given that 9.25 again that's kind of the issues i've wanted to be told more would you recommend absolutely 10 out of 10 i would absolutely recommend just because there is some stuff that i have questions about doesn't mean that i wouldn't recommend it perhaps i can find it on instagram send them a dm not sure um they have a large internet presence i would assume they would respond to people overall i feel like i've got to give them for a bit i don't know again if this is canvas terpenes but if this is a botanical terpene device i would give this a 9.5 i might even bump it up to a 9.75 if i find out that this is cannabis terps this gets a 10 out of 10 for bluedream this is incredible steezy has done a great job 100 see why this is such a respected brand and why people like this one of the top sellers um overall like i said you know 9.75 for me i appreciate you guys for all the love check out more of the reviews this blue dream here from steezy california i believe we're going to be reviewing some more products from them in washington so stay tuned follow us on all the socials instagram twitter youtube uh we're all over the place linkedin if you're there networking man please tap in west coast you tour 2020 we'll tap in here soon appreciate you guys for all the love pop some [ __ ] in the comments we'll talk soon peace [Music]

everyone welcome to seed starting for beginners thank you very much for joining us tonight as always i am ryan tackleberry the digital services librarian for the genesee district library and tonight we're talking about seed starting uh to give you a little introduction this is a video that i recorded last week with kelly stack our library assistant at our fenton branch and she runs the seed library there if you didn't know our fenton jacker wine garden branch has a seed library where you can come into the library and you can take seeds home there's a whole like a catalog you look through it's really cool and it's at the fenton branch if you want to learn more about it i advise you to go to our website and let me share here on my screen really quick under services you can go to seed library and this has all the information here about the fenton seed library including you know how it works how you take out seeds at the end of you know the the summer when you've harvested your plants you can harvest seeds and bring them back in and we accept those it describes where our seeds come from and also a database of what exactly is in our seed library and what's available and that's on our website at uh the gbl.org and specifically you can go to the gbl.org slash seed hyphen library the link is right there below for you so take a look that if you're interested in uh gardening and getting started um with a garden this year or if you've done it in the past this is a great location i know a lot of our staff members at the library actually started doing some gardening last year and used seeds from the seed library and it's worked out really great so i wanted to plug that at the beginning as i said kelly stack she is the one there that maintains it if you have questions at the end of the video kelly will have her email and a phone number where you can reach her to ask questions um but as always you can submit them on our website too under questions here at the top right and we can make sure that gets to who it needs to go to before we get started too let me just talk about a few other programs we have coming up that may be relevant to your interests um over here on april 6th we have beginning gardening for adults which will also be uh by kelly stack our library assistant and then we have um seed saving 101 actually kelly is doing one of these i forget which one now the top of my head um but both these will be great so if you're interested in gardening these will be two more excellent uh virtual programs you'll be able to access on our website at the gdl.org virtual or of course um on facebook in youtube where all of our other virtual programs are as well if you do have questions while watching this please feel leave them in a comment and then i'll make sure that kelly gets back to you as well with whatever your question may be or if i can answer i would be happy to do so as well um but yeah other than that we will get started and if you have questions put them in a comment so i can i can see them and stay come stay tuned for our future seed library and gardening related programs so with that being said we will get started here enjoy hello and welcome to seed starting for beginners i am kelly stack and by the end of this video you will be confident enough to start your own seeds now what you will learn in this presentation is how to select quality seed from reliable sources different types of seeds and why you would want to grow them the life cycle of seeds and how to start them care for them harden them off and transplant them now to get started there's a few things that you're going to need you're going to need a container to grow your seeds in a growing medium such as a seed starter grow lights or a very sunny windowsill water and seeds now starting with containers we've got some no cost containers that you may want to use you can use old food containers such as empty butter dishes toilet paper rolls newspaper pots or old takeout containers such as you get from applebee's that come complete with their own clear dome now you can make pots out of anything that will hold soil and water or if you have little money to spend or like reusing objects they work just as well as store-bought seed trays and if you don't want to use old egg cartons or reusable food containers you can buy seed starting kits from a big box store or nursery those are relatively inexpensive but you can also spend more money on specialized seed starting trays and or equipment which cost more they come in many shapes and sizes most of which come in a clear dome which acts as a greenhouse to warm the soil and keep moisture in so seeds don't dry out now here you will see a bunch of different kinds of seed starting trays in the bottom middle you will see reused food containers to grow vegetables out of and to the right of that you will see an egg carton that has been used to start seeds and the upper right you will see little pots made out of newspaper these are all free that you can make at home and use but if you want something more put together you can go to the store and buy some seed starting tips you'll see the jiffy seed starting greenhouse kit that is a square kit that will grow 36 plants in it there are many different types like that at the store there is a double size that is what a full flat is called and those grow up to 72 plants now these other ones you see here are more specialized they're made out of harder plastic they're durable they'll last many many years these cost more than the jiffy seed starting kits those are usually six to ten dollars to purchase those these other ones such as this park seed one you see at the bottom may cost around forty dollars or more and it just depends on what works for you and what you want to use now what do you put in your containers to plant your seeds in you don't want to put soil from your garden from your backyard in your pots because it can have bacteria diseases and other things living in it that can hinder your little seeds ability to grow and be strong so we start with a seed starting mix or seed starting potting mix or peat pellets these are good mediums to start your seeds in they are generally used because they're sterile meaning they don't have bacteria or fungi growing in them which will hurt your seeds chances of growing you can find these at any local hardware store your local gardening stores and they're pretty inexpensive now if you don't want to buy those and you have a lot of seeds to start you can make your own seed starting mix what you're going to do is you're going to use one part sphagnum peat moss or coco coir one part pearlite and one part vermiculite now the peat moss is moss coco coir is the hair that comes on the outside of coconuts and that is a byproduct of the coconut industry is the coco coir paralyte perlite is a type of volcanic glass and vermiculite is a mineral and both perlite and vermiculite have a large surface area to them which holds onto and retains moisture in your mix which is what plants and seeds need now seeds you can collect your seeds from almost any source but you want to make sure you're getting your seeds from a lot reliable source so you want to go with a trusted seed company getting seeds from friends passing them around you can get them from your local seed library what you want to watch out for is getting seeds off of amazon or buying them off of wish now oftentimes what you will find is you'll find listings for interesting varieties of like watermelon for example and strawberry where they're trying to sell you a blue strawberry a blue watermelon and you can tell that these have been photoshopped because of their colors just don't match with what actually grows in nature now vegetables come in all sizes and colors but these ones you can tell have been photoshopped so you just want to watch out for those and so when you're deciding on what seeds to grow what varieties and types there are there's some terminology that you might not be aware of we have heirloom open pollinated and hybrid seeds so what's the difference heirloom seeds are open pollinated seeds that grow true to type meaning you get the same plant year after year that have been existence for 50 to 100 years or longer open pollinated seeds are seeds that grow true to type but haven't been around long enough to be called an heirloom it's like being called an antique once they're old enough they're called heirlooms and then there are hybrid seeds that are crossbreeds of two different varieties of the parent plants so two different types of tomatoes or two different types of peas two different types of squash and these seeds should not be saved as they will not grow true to type so if you're not going to save seeds from them then go ahead and plant them because they have a lot of benefits to growing hybrids they have been developed to resist disease to be heartier all sorts of things that are beneficial to your garden but if you want to save seed then you're going to want to stick to your open pollinated and heirloom varieties now what does open pollination mean when pollination occurs by insect wind birds humans and other natural mechanisms because there are no restrictions on the flow of pollination between individuals open pollinated plants are more genetically diverse now when you get your seeds your seed packets have all the information that you need to grow your plants now if you look at the back of your seed packets as you can see here it has the instructions on how to grow them when to start them how deep to plant them how far apart to place your plants how long they take to germinate and how many days until you get a harvest now the days to harvest that they show you is from transplant not from when you plant the seed it'll tell you if they need full sun or if they can handle part shade and what zones you can grow them in now that's a great thing about seeds is that you can never have enough seeds but you can have not enough space to grow them so it's okay to buy a lot of seeds to have a lot of seeds you just might not have enough space to grow them in your garden now this is the moment you've been waiting for how to start your seed so we're gonna start your seeds so you're gonna gather your containers your growing medium and your seeds you're gonna moisten your growing medium you want it to be moist not wet so put your growing medium in a bowl a big bowl and start adding water just a little bit at a time until it's moist like a wrung out sponge so when you grab a handful of it you can squeeze it and there shouldn't be any water that drips out of it and it should hold together fairly well and then when you open your hand it should crumble only just a little bit so then you because you want it moist not wet because you don't want your seeds to rot then you will plant your seed to depth which will be listed on your seed packets and if your seed packets don't have the information on them you can also look them up online it's very easy to find information on seeds online so then you're going to plant your seed to depth you're going to cover it with soil and then when you're all done planting your seeds in your in your little pots you're going to either cover your seed starting tray with the dome that came with it or plastic wrap this will hold in the moisture and will help heat up the soil area so that the seed can germinate then you're going to place your seeds under grow lights or in a sunny window the seeds need warmth to grow and adding a seedling heat mat is optional the heat mats warm the soil between 75 and 85 degrees now seeds and seedlings need light they need 12 to 16 hours of light a day why not enough light makes your seeds weak and leggy why sometimes growth and germination can only be triggered by extra light now here's an example of different types of brolites that you can buy for seed starting now the top two are fairly inexpensive we got a fairy morse uh variety t5 light it's about two feet wide and 11 inches tall and it's just like a skinny little tiny light bulb which the fairy morse the sunblaster seed starting universal t5 light stand and the hydro farm jumpstart all use and these fairy morse and the sun blaster are about 40 bucks that's a lot of money but sometimes you can find them on sale or on clearance at the end of the season the hydro farm jumpstart is the first light that i ever bought for starting seeds myself and that cost about 60 to 70 dollars and then you get into the led grow lights and there are many different types that exist and some are inexpensive and some are expensive so what you want to do is if you're going to get row lights take a look at what is offered and what they do in and pick what fits into your budget if you don't have the money to buy any lights you can put them in a sunny window now water seeds need water to grow and what happens is when you water the seeds it takes that hard seed coating and softens it and wakes the seed up out of dormancy now that seed just has just enough energy to put out roots and send up its first leaves after that the ceiling needs the nutrients found in the soil and needs to take an energy from the sun now here's the life cycle of the seeds so you'll start out with your seed on the left you will plant it and as you water it and it gets enough warmth and light it will grow a root which is called the radicule and the seed has just enough energy to put out a root and put out its first leaves now it'll grow the radicule which is the root and then it'll start extending the hypocotyl which is the stem and then it will push the cotyledons out of the soil which are the first leaves and at that point it will start taking in energy from the sun through the first leaves and nutrients through the roots from the soil and then it will grow the first true leaves true leaves are the first leaves of the plant and from then on it will take in energy in the form of the sun and nutrients from the soil through the roots so now all you need to do is wait you've selected your seeds you've planted them and you gave them light and water so now you just have to sit back and be patient each type germinates at different times and once your seeds have germinated you may remove the dome and then you keep them long enough to transplant them outside when it's time now once they are big enough to transplant outside you're going to take your seedlings about one to two weeks before the last frost date you're going to start taking them outside every day for a little bit of time and lengthening that as each day goes on to get them used to the weather outside the sun can burn them the wind can sculpt them the temperatures can kill them so you take them out a little bit at a time every day in the warm sun so they can get used to the harsh temperatures because if you just take them from inside to outside they're going to wilt because they're not strong enough so you have to build up their strength before you put them in the ground thank you for listening to my video you can email me at k-stack at the gdl.org or call me at the fenton branch at 629-7612 i have some resources for you here

tell from that if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cartridge video uh it's another populous herb cartridge video you know i only have i would say about one and a half videos on it i do have another video where you know we're we've just picked up pop herbs but i didn't really you know get into detail um the other flavors were pretty good um but i just had to i just had to try blue dream for myself i don't know i'm not really fond of blue dream but i rarely see it in a cartridge and i figured you know it's nine dollars you know if you didn't see my other papa herbs video it's nine dollars for a half gram cart of blue dream so you know i had to pop cop it and uh let me know you guys opinion on blue dream homie stevie says that purple punch is the new blue dream let me know your thoughts on that that's what he says but yeah it's the cartridge itself i already been smoking on it as you can tell you know they don't come this low but very very enjoyable very very candy-like uh i wouldn't say blueberry taste but i don't let's just get it handy i'm gonna put it in my tutron family so cheers like i get a slight weird taste to it like the similar taste that you would get from like i don't know it's like that weird black licorice taste i don't know if it's exactly it's like a weird taste but then you get the the the sweetness uh kind of um like a like a candy taste um but overall good it is just lit when it comes to papa herbs it is going to be distillate uh if you didn't see the back it is running at 87.60 or 87.63 percent uh packaged on packaged on august 10th of 2020 and uh it says right here manufactured by sublime so yeah uh i mean the cartridge itself very very nice but for those of you who are expecting live resin you're not going to get that for nine dollars for a half gram but overall very very good for your budget cartridge smokers you know if you have nine dollars after you purchase all this stuff and you want to get a cartridge you know i'll definitely recommend this and i'd like to say that nine dollars is the price that i pay in modesto california obviously it's going to be different where you're from even different dispensaries in same cities range different prices so just please just keep that in mind when you're like looking for this car it's not going to be nine dollars if you're not where i'm at you know i'm saying so but yeah blue dream very very good strain from them uh as of right now the probably the best strain that i've tried from papa herbs their cartridges is the gelato but i would say that maybe this is the second best out of all the ones that i've tried i've tried forbidden fruit i've tried wedding cake the consensus with my friends saying that the wedding cake is actually the best but i didn't really like it it's too i don't know i just didn't i mean it's not bad but i didn't enjoy it as much as i would say this or the forbidden fruit one which kind of added like a little pomegranate taste and you guys know like i'm not i don't prefer my cartridges to taste like fruits and all that stuff because it just i think it they don't get me as high when it tastes like fruit it has to taste like wheat to me and it might just be a thing in my brain that kind of just does it's like an anti-placebo or placebo um but yeah it just i don't i don't hate it you know obviously there's some pros to it you know like if i'm smoking this they're just going to think that i'm hitting a blueberry vape or something but yes i do prefer you know when it tastes like the butt itself cannabis derived terpenes instead of fruity terpenes but nonetheless still a really really good buy you know i still this like maybe the the second this is the second time i bought a papa herbs cartridge and it's because it's so affordable and why not you know and uh yeah like like i said in the first pop earth video when it costs nine dollars uh and it's good it's a win-win because at the end of the day it's nine dollars and it's good and even it like it's so cheap you know what i'm saying like even if you did pay nine dollars and it's shitty you just paid nine dollars you know so i'm gonna take one more hit one more no actually two more hits i'm gonna take another one and then i'm gonna show you guys how much smoke i'm actually getting or vape or whatever cheers oh you see don't have that much left but it's been getting me getting me through the week you feel me oh all right let's take start here peace out guys [Music] you", "dOIPYKdKYy4": "what's going on fish nerds it has been a while since we've looked at my shrimp tanks so today I'm going to show you the cherry shrimp and the fantasy blue dreams and talk a little bit about how I care for them let's get started alright so here is the 10 gallon cherry shrimp tank and depending on how long you've been watching my videos you may or may not remember the video when I first got these guys I ordered 20 of them nine months ago from flip aquatics rub and as you can see there are definitely a lot more than 20 shrimp in this tank at this point and I did just feed so they're all starting to swarm up here to the front of the tank and I don't know how many there are but I'm guessing at least a few hundred shrimp in this tank I'm not the best at guessing numbers you might look at it and get a completely different number than what I'm estimating but they have definitely exploded in here either way and I'm not really doing anything special for these guys as far as taking care of them I feed them every day and I would actually attribute a lot of the success that I've had with these guys on this right here the automatic water change the drip system because I do have 12 gallons of water per day going through this tank because this is a half gallon per hour drip emitter because that's how much I need this tank to drip down into the tank below because that's how my drip system runs each tank drips into this tank below it so in order to support this entire rack I've got both of these tanks taken 1/2 gallon per hour as well as the third with the third actually dripping down into the 30 and 20 gallons over on the other rack but in order for that to be enough water for the entire rack I have to have 12 gallons per each of these tanks which means that this tank is getting a hundred and twenty percent water change every single day so constantly clean fresh water so I really don't have to worry about over feeding especially with the snails the snails pick up with the shrimp don't eat and then the water change takes care of the rest plus I do have all this hornwort up here which not only helps to keep the water clean but also gives them a nice surface to graze on and you can see a bunch of them or well I can get past the glare they're all grazing up in there all the time and I actually like to get up here sometimes and look down and a lot of times they'll actually be climbing around on top of that little algae ball there but it's kind of a cool view if I can get the camera to focus in on some of these from above to watch these foraging around near the surface it's pretty neat but like I said I do attribute a lot of the success to the automatic water change the drip system because one the drip system keeps the water parameter is completely stable because it's just a slow steady drip constantly so I don't have any big swings I'm not letting the water quality get down to a certain point and then doing a big water change is just a constant slow steady drip so they're essentially always being drip acclimated to the water and also with 120 percent water change I'm not having to worry about over feeding too much which also means that I can feed them plenty enough that they're constantly breeding and you can see they are constantly breeding all over the place they've just exploded in this tank and they've also now spread down here to this forty gallon if you move down here and they're actually starting to really take off and this tank as well you see some babies there she's gorgeous to focus in on her we're back there so they're doing great and this tank as well starting to really take over in here ton of bristlenose frying here as well I'm hoping this tank will sort of just take off and turn into a bob steam fot esque breeding for-profit tank with all this hornwort in here and the Guppies and the bristlenose and the shrimp it's doing pretty well so far you see I just fed so everybody's kind of swarm in this area right here but yeah I really don't do anything special for my cherry shrimp I just feed them plenty and I keep their water clean and keep the parameter stable with the drip system and as far as what I feed these guys I feed them pretty much everything and everything I feed my fish I'll also feed to the Guppies whether that be you know flakes pellets even the green beans that I feed the bristlenose and also I will feed shrimp specific foods I feed the shrimp king complete I feed the shrimp king protein shrimp king mineral I do also feed back Turei AE for the baby shrimp so that there's plenty of biofilm and things for the babies to graze on I think that's an excellent food for shrimp 'lets and also one of my favorite things to feed these guys is just regular old spirulina powder which you can get on Amazon it's actually human food grade it's just a really fine powder that actually look it basically just dissolves into the water and it just turns the water totally green and then as it does dissolved in the water they can actually kind of filter feed a little bit and grab it out of the water and eat it but it all it ends up just settling all over everything and it just creates this nice green film all over the glass and all over the plants and the wood and the gravel and everything and that just gives them a great thing to just graze on and a really good form high protein and because it is something that they can just you know pick off of everything and graze on the film that it leaves behind it's just a great food for these guys and so here is the fantasy blue tank I did start off with 10 of these guys just about a month ago and they're doing great I've already had two females berry up and release babies and those babies are already growing very quickly it's getting harder and harder to tell the babies from the adults just waiting on females to berry up again and really hoping that it won't be too long before the babies start breeding themselves but these guys are doing great they're eating on some shrimp king mineral right now everybody's acting really good but it's looking really good I cannot wait until this tank blows up and looks like this tank like I said we're only a month into it but we've already had a couple batches of babies get this glare out of here and everybody's growing everybody's doing good I just love these shrimp these fantasy blues the blue dreams have got to be my favorite of the Neo caridina as far as their color goes love the look of these shrimp maybe that that one back there on the food just is so dark it almost looks black but that's not a black shrimp that's just a deep deep blue absolutely gorgeous alright guys shorter video this week just wanted to show you my shrimp tanks and how they're doing it's been a while since we've really looked at them here on the channel so just kind of wanted to put them in the spotlight a little bit and give you an update on the cherry shrimp and the blue dreams and I have had a ton of people asking about me selling the cherry shrimp and I have talked about recently I'm trying to move away from breeding for profit just because I've got so much going on I don't have time to focus on it and stuff but because of popular demand I am going to temporarily put the cherry shrimp on my website fish nerdstore calm so you can check out the link in the description below and that will just be a temporary thing for those that have been begging for it so I'll try to have that by the time this video goes out but if they're not out on the website yet keep checking they'll be there very soon but I am gonna try to get them out there by the time the video comes out and I do want to say thank you guys for that support and wanting to buy it from me it means a lot and thank you guys for watching this video for supporting the channel you guys are awesome god bless your fish nerds I'll see you next time", "IwFl5_mHx5E": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the icemoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at two new flavors of the goods disposable distillate vape pens if you've been watching the channel you would have seen my review of the grape ape last month and boy did i enjoy it there are two new flavors out this month straw nana and blue dream both of which i really enjoy anyway so i am going to try these out in the video today and let you know my thoughts so if you want to get your hands on any of the goods distillate vape pens you can do so on the hemphealth website they retail at 19 pounds 99 however at time of filming they're on offer for 15 pounds you can even use the discount code i smoke 10 for 10 off let's take a quick look at the packaging that they came in so the box says ingredients broad spectrum cbd distillate and terpenes instructions for use our vapes are auto draw activated simply take slow smooth drags until the desired effect is reached do not exceed 70mg cbd a day must be 18 plus to use this product good manufacturing process certified gmp big thanks to the goods for sending these over for me to have a look at today they come in the same packaging that the grape flavour does that the maui wowie flavor does with the package that you peel open to ensure freshness inside this little box inside we have the vape pen which looks like this and it's actually a proprietary vape pen it's not using a c cell cartridge but rather is using their own device in this pen is 45 cbd distiller in this case flavored with blue dream and in this case flavoured with straw nana this is part of their hustle range which is for the daytime and this is part of their chill range which is for the evening although being a cannabis consumer i tend to just consume them whenever i want that flavor profile and with great results as well each of these will deliver up to 300 puffs but that is going to completely depend on how big your puffs are you can treat this more like a dab pen and do some quite big puffs and get some quite big clouds with it or you can sip it and it will last longer they don't actually have a charging port because they are single use you just use it until it runs out and actually you never need to worry about charging it worth mentioning obviously as a disposable product in 2020 it's not as eco-friendly as something that you would use again and again but they tend to last quite a while and i'm still only using my second or third pen so i'm not creating a lot of waste with it so what i'm going to do now is try out both of these flavors and let you know my thoughts starting with the blue dream here we go oh that's got a nice flavor profile to it so it's kind of sweet blue and berries like all together as one literally no hemp taste at all it's just pure terpenes and that is very very nice blue dream is actually up there on my list of cannabis strains the distillate delivers a really nice turpee flavor although it's not going to taste like if you were smoking blue dream in a bong for example i'm impressed with that really easy to vape as you can see you don't need to press any buttons hold it to your lips and inhale let's take a look at the straw nana flavor profile which looks very similar it's the same device but it has a different logo printed on it this is a really cool thing about the goods range say you had different flavors just sitting there on your desk you can flip them over and see which flavor is which very easily you're not going to get mixed up not that you would once you've tasted them anyway but the the color code and the little icon on the back is really handy in that regard looking at the straw 9r1 i could actually smell this when i opened it and i was like really excited just from opening it out of the packet and getting that terpy aroma i'm going to taste it now oh that is the terpest of them all that is strawberry and banana and the blue turp and yeah mercene all the nice ones that that go into um like the sort of sweet good sex tracks i think leaves a lovely sort of taste on the inside of my lips there and it's really present during the exhale as well really can taste it as i'm breathing it out lovely straw nana really really good indeed which do i prefer out of the two that's an interesting one i did this with the grey paper and the maui wowie and the grey paper came out on top when i'm trying to pick between the blue dream and the straw nana i'm leaning towards the straw nana because the flavor profile is just so distinguishable you can smell it you can smell strawberries and bananas you can taste strawberries and bananas both of them deliver a really nice smooth vaping experience but this one has got a really deserty kind of feel to it which i really like so do i think this is a good product and how do i think it compares to other stuff on the market personally i'm not vaping c cell devices anymore i'm just vaping these distillate pens from the goods i didn't vape a lot of vape pens anyway but these deliver a really nice responsive result and a really nice flavor as well so i've just found myself vaping these i also think they're worth it as a product on their own merit because 20 pounds for a single use vape pen that's going to actually last you quite a while and give you regular hits of cannabidiol i think is quite a good deal when you factor in how good it tastes it does make it a really easy decision for me and i will certainly be getting some more when this runs out but if you are really stuck for flavor profiles and you can't pick between them then go with the straw nana or go with the grape ape in my opinion you will not be disappointed one thing i wanted to try was just trying out these flavor profiles together just to see what they taste like blue nana or straw dream it's a nice combination guys what do you think of this video have you tried any of the good disposable vape pens from the hemphealth website do leave your comments below let me know your favorite terpene profiles and i will catch up with you in another video in 2021 folks thank you so much for watching it has been an absolute pleasure this year here on the channel thanks for joining us on our 2020 journey looking forward to 2021 as always thanks for watching and keep talking [Music] so [Music] you", "on6z_PR6DHQ": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to sparkle with sophie with me your favorite disney girl so today on the channel i'm going to be talking to my wonderful friend helen who is a tech girl for the walt disney company and disney cruise line specifically if you are new to the channel welcome if you've been here before and you are one of my subscribers welcome back so glad you could come and join me again my name is sophie i'm from the uk and i've been a walt disney company cast member and performer for three years let me show you my badges so i've been working for disney cruise line i've worked on the disney fantasy i've worked on the disney dream and it is literally the best job ever it's incredible so i wanted to do this video and with lots of my lovely colleagues and co-workers and just wonderful friends to let you know about the different roles in entertainment and i really hope you enjoy it so make sure you like and subscribe to the channel and i'll hand over to helen hello everybody my name is helen i am 27 years old and i'm from essex down in southeast england i've been working with disney cruise line since 2017 so i think i've just completed my seventh contract aboard i have worked on three out of the four vessels and i am the stage props and puppets technician in the walt disney theater i trained at guildhall school of music and drama university in central london where i managed to obtain a bachelor's degree in technical theater design and realization which is basically just a posh name for construction scenic painting prop making puppetry and anything that you really see visually on a stage but are the costumes and the lighting so my audition is going to be slightly different from other people's just because fun fact i used to be scared of cruise ships i know right um so when dcl came to our university um they were recruiting upcoming technicians and my lecturer did actually put my name forward and um stupidly i had declined um just due to the fact that i didn't even think disney had cruise ships to begin with um but that was not really where i saw my life going so i came home and i told my parents and mum being mum was typically excited and was like oh my god that's that's such a good opportunity like wow well done like what you gonna do um and then dad was like that's great like just go for it it's a good opportunity like do you know what you're going to do out of university anyway um and then i told them i declined it [Laughter] so um a couple of months later i had my graduation project and the same guy came from disney um where he took my cv and he took my business card and then he asked me again um look we'd really like you on our team we've seen something in you that we think would be beneficial and um would like you to come to an audition and stupidly again but politely i declined it for the second time um so when i came home and told my parents um dad being classic dad was like look you have nothing to lose you are gonna be traveling the world you're gonna be meeting so many amazing people um you just finished university you're going to be moving back home what have you got to lose so uh he cleverly really knows how i work so um once again disney contacted me for the third time and i was like third time's a charm and i actually accepted the audition so i had to go down to hammersmith in london and i had a portfolio with me of all of my previous work that i have done from metal work carpentry scenic painting prop making puppets for stage management i've even done a bit of and lighting um and also a lot of like rigging so automation stuff so um yeah basically i think um we sat down in a room and we had to do like a we had a test like a quiz uh to begin with uh where we answered a few questions and then we had a face-to-face interview um they were really pleasant it was really nice i didn't feel under pressure i didn't feel um i didn't feel any negativity it was just so positive and then yeah there and then i just remember um shaking the guy's hand and said thank you so much for your time and i remember him telling me there and then on the spot that they would like me to have they would really like to have me on their team so yeah i just accepted it and was like this is great everything happens for a reason and ever since that moment i'm just so so glad that i number one listen to my dad number two i'm just so glad and happy that i actually took that leap of faith because disney has honestly changed my life and i know that sounds really cliche but the people that i've met from through disney professionally and as friends um have honestly changed my life so the hardest part of my job oh i would say is sometimes being alone um so it is always nice to just be able to whack on some musicals in the workshop and just be able to think that i'm a dina or whatever just singing out my lungs but sometimes there is large bits of sets and scenery that would just be nice just to have another helping hand who um who knows the skills that is needed to fix things so even though the boys are amazing and they always help out wherever they can and help to assist me um sometimes you can't just explain to someone hey can you go and like fix that like this because other people's variations of skill sets are obviously depicted by what they've learned um so even though people obviously think that painting is pretty easy like oh i painted my house um that's great but they're all blocked colors but if i ask you hey can you do a marble effect on this um you know i can't expect other techies in the team unless they've had a background in that to to be able to execute that it's number one it's not fair and number two we want it to match as best we can the rest of the scenic element um so yeah it just would be nice just to have maybe a helping hand so that one person can just maybe be working on maintenance another person can do like the evening shows or like vice versa um take it in turns it's just it just would be nice to have a little friend that would be able to help me um i don't mind working alone but it is always good just to be able to bounce around your ideas with someone else and be like hey this is broken like this um i'm thinking about fixing it like this do you think that's the best option and they would even be like yeah great and just that reassurance knowing that that's the best thing for it or then being like well have you tried this and then you're like oh my god totally didn't even think of that just being able to bounce around ideas i would say um would be really nice really nice to just be not the only girl but yeah just have a little body a little shadow someone who would be able to just help everything to be in nice pretty working order so my favorite part of the job i would say is um no day is the same i tend to get bored very easily if something is quite routine and regimental and structured every single day so it's just like groundhog day so practically like covered um but no um the the things i love about the job is that when casts come to me and if a prop is broken or it's not functioning the way it should be just general wear and tear um i already am working out how i can resolve this issue and i will do my absolute best to get it done for their next show whether that be in two days time a week's time or less than 30 minutes time um so yeah i just like being able to problem solve on the spot and my brain is constantly ticking and being able to give it back to them and them not even noticing in a good way they're not even noticing or seeing where it was damaged before if something is cracked or broken into and you managed to get it back together just with all the training and the skills that i've learned um yeah just being able to give it back to them and they're like oh my god this is this is amazing like how do you do that wow that gives you a real sense of pride and it also shows that they have pride in that too and they do look after things and it's amazing but we are out in the middle of the sea floating along um for months months at a time and yeah it's just really nice to be able to just fix things and joy on their faces they're like little children um but also i think my favorite part of the job is just seeing everyone every day uh you don't realize that the ship has so many casts and crew and even people who are not even in your area dining or yas or cruise stuff it's just so nice that you're just walking around and you see them and you say hi and it just feels like family it really really does i can't stress that enough um being half greek we love family and literally working for disney even shore side members they know you you build up a rapport and it's just really really nice to see faces when you've been out at sea for so long um you do everything together you're stuck on a you're stuck in a floating can on the sea so um you go out in ports together you go and have dinner together um you'll do certain things in the night time going off and getting a cup of tea um is always a favorite nice cup of peppermint tea um it's always a nice favorite one of mine uh just watching the stars and the waves crash against the ship at night it's it's honestly beautiful um that's definitely definitely the best parts of the job so an average week for myself um it's obviously different to other techies in the theater there is like i said before only one of me and there is always always something that can be maintained or uh touched up in any sort of way regardless of how good you are we are on a moving ship and we are running into shows day in day out so first of all we all the techies come in and we run a system auto check which is basically where we run the show's moving elements um all one at a time just to make sure that everything's running smoothly that everything is safe and is running the way it should be for that night's performance that will go in well i then would set out all of my props puppets and any scenic elements that we didn't set out the night before so um every prop and puppet has its location to start off with it might not finish in the same location um but i do know where everything starts everything finish it finishes throughout the entire show um so i will set out all of my props and that changes from cast to cast sometimes um one cast member might have something that starts stage left the next time the next cast might have that same cast member in the same role might have something at the start stage right so it all varies from class to class you just have to be really flexible and adapt to the needs of the show um so yeah i set out everything and then during the middle of the day i would try and maintain any bits and bobs i have to fix uh i'm i have like ocd i swear so i made like a board in my office uh workshop and it's divided into the shows and then i put post-it notes in each section so that if something has broken my show i'll just make a quick note of it on my uh notebook and then i will go and put post note in that description designated section so i i've always got it going in the back of my brain and i can see it visually that okay i need to go and fix that so then when that show's not up and i can do it then i get to work with that so that really helps me visually to see anything that damages um so then that's my normal day um and then we will get changed into our blacks and then we will get ready for the show so we'll do like a super mop of the entire stage so that's just to make sure that any debris from the previous day or that morning um if someone's been working on the stage that it's just all cleaned and we are all ready for the actors and the cast to come in we don't want any dust to be around safety is our number one priority and we are all there to help each other so we clean them up the stage i then do a pre-show check and i just check that all the props are still in the same place um i check that everything is still in work in order something could have happened during the day it does it's not anyone's fault um but something could be out and something could have fallen on it something could have knocked people could have like hit it if they went by accidentally and just haven't been able to find me to inform me so i just checked everything is all in good working order then we have our show and then curtain goes down and i will preset again for the next show that will be happening in the second seating so basically whoop everything back to the way it was as it will start showing then we'll run and go and have dinner and um sometimes we don't get to have that dinner because we just something could have broken mid-show and i need to fix it for the next show it could be a crucial element that i don't have a backup of that needs to be fixed which is absolutely fine it's no skin off my nose um normally i can get informed about it during the mid show via a headset and i'm already put into place the procedures that need to be taken so then we'll have the next show after the second show i will pack away all of the props and all of a sudden scenery into their housing locations then we will soon as the houses are cleared we then are in our transition of striking so striking in theater for those of you that might not know is basically we are taking down that previous show because we are on the ship and it is a moving thing everything is breaked for safety um so we basically strike that show and we are pulling out the next show ready to like kind of tetris and do a little switch over and then we are gonna um set up for the next show so we're kind of doing a strike and a setup at the same time um so we're fitting up the next show for the next night um and we are taking down the old show so normally we finish around about 11 45 at night um and then we kind of practically get up and do it all the next day um luckily if you if we do get into ports we are able to have maybe a couple of hours off but it all does depend on your own discretion so if there is something that is broken i i cannot go out if it's needed for that show i can't just go out and support and have a great time because the main thing is my job and i'm there to do my job and if it's needed for that show and it's a show element i have to do that first it's that's that's pretty much common knowledge um we normally get on average 60 hours a week but i will always do more than that just because i can always do something in the theater i can always fix something so i try and aim to hit between 65 hours um sometimes 70 every week just because i like to make sure that everything is in tip-top working order and it gives you such a sense of pride and satisfaction when something is completed and you see it on stage and it's it just looks beautiful so i don't just work in the wall disney theater there is props um that are needed in other locations around the ship such as the deck party um i also work in the kids clubs so i think there's three or four kids clubs on the ship different ages age levels they also have would have props and they have games and they have things around their studios if you'd like to say um that do need um to be fixed or maintained that's when i have a really nice close rapport with the the carpenters um on the ship because some elements might be actual ship base where some are actually props so we have a good rapport and we can talk to each other and the item will get fixed um i also have some props in restaurants so it's my duty to look after them as well just to make sure everything is in running order if anything gets broken i i'm alerted um if possible by the teams that are there um and ship wide normally come and bring it to me which is really really helpful um so yeah they're my other little jobs around the ship it's just to try and keep everything maintained as much as it can be um and everything to look nice and pretty so my dream role would probably be either someone who works for the parks and is able to create all the aesthetics so before you get onto a ride everything you see while you're queuing um the things on the rides when you're going around and you're seeing everything that's all made and created um hey who doesn't want to say that they painted the castle like that's pretty cool um and then i would also say being an imagineer would be would be the highlight uh being able to get my creative brain everything that's in here out into a visual masterpiece let's say um that would be phenomenal that would actually be amazing um unfortunately because i am english it's a little bit tricky to obviously get a job out in the parks um but just being able to be part of the creative team of disney would be would absolutely be perfection um disney is a great company and it is known worldwide so being able to say hey i worked on that gives you such a sense of pride and ownership so that would be my absolute dream to keep myself busy during covid i have just been doing um little jobs and little projects for my parents when i've been at home anything really that they need to decorate their house i just like to assist in that it's one of my strengths so of course i'd be happy to do it for them um a few little odds loads of little things that you've wanted to do that you've never had the time for um so i have a motorbike but i actually have never had the time or been in the same country for long enough to um have a driving licence with a car so i was currently taking that but that was a pre lockdown 2.0 3.0 um so yeah that unfortunately had to stop but then i've just been um learning a bit how to tap dance and doing a few handstands because that's what every kid does right um also i have just applied um for a master's degree down in falmouth university on special effects makeup and prosthetics um that has always been a passion of mine since university was special effects makeup and um having a great opportunity to be able to do a master's degree in that is honestly i'm getting so excited just thinking about it so like positive thoughts are out into the universe um i'm really hoping and praying that i get that that would be the next step to elevate my career and um i would be so fortunate to be able to have received uh that spot so yeah that is that would be a great opportunity so the advice that i could give um for upcoming technicians that would love to apply for disney would just be be as hybrid as you can so try not to just stay focused in your one area um that is great and that's obviously how you're going to get your job but it's good to be flexible and it's good to have at least the basics or the the willingness to learn other pathways we are on a ship for four to six seven months at a time um and you need to just be willing to help each other it is a very much family orientated place so you know if something does go wrong in automation i at least now know the basics that is needed to do something so that the automation operator doesn't have to come all the way down from his box up up on like the second seating to come all the way down to the stage because he can't control it at the same time um on the bigger ships there is um an asr 2 which is fantastic um but on the smaller ships there isn't one so um not that it falls down to props but it's good to just be able to be there so that you can help them out um it is so nice when you can just help each other out it's easier um and also you're just growing in yourself um it's it's such a good idea just to expand all your knowledge in every category it's don't just be stuck in your ways with blinkers on because at the end of the day if you're just looking at this you cannot see things that are coming from that side so i would just recommend yeah being a hybrid and being positive it's a phenomenal experience the places that you get to visit um i think i've seen 37 countries um which only populates to 14 of the world so we do live in this amazing place and having the opportunity to travel whilst working and doing what you love is it's a lot of people's dream jobs i can guarantee you all i ever hear from family and friends is travel while you're young and disney has that amazing balance where you are working and you are doing the things that you love and you are learning and growing as a person in the industry as well as as a human but then you're also able to go and see these beautiful places that the world has to offer so i would just say be outgoing give things a go never say no um just you you've always got something to learn and you might do something and not like it and that's absolutely fine um but just just have passion and drive and be there to help each other out i think that's the main thing my strengths as a technician i would say um [Music] i love spray guns so whether that's the gravity feeder whether that's spray can whether that's airbrushing i do really really love the effect that you can give with it and how you can just layer up the process it lets you be let you have that inner graffiti artist coming out um i have always yeah i've always loved the sprays being a female i'm pretty strong with being able to lift things and push things because obviously we are in a theater that is uh a lot of things are made pretty heavy because they have to be robust they have to last the duration of their time so um he's really reassuring when uh you can you can hold your own against uh other guys in the theater um and yeah it's just really i don't know it's just really nice being able to pick up something and then the guys you're going up in their estimations is what i think really um yeah i don't know what other strengths um just being friendly i suppose maybe that helps thank you so much to helen for joining us on the channel i hope this has been helpful for anybody who loves disney or who's really into being a tech or just wanted to watch some girls talking about some really cool disney stuff make sure

"CGIc2TBXxVE": "what's up are you dragons I'm toasty dragon and today I'm telling you guys a life story that I promised a while ago and it's about the first time I smoked the wheat strain blue dream if you don't know what blue dream is blue dream is a hybrid weed it's a 50/50 split between an indica and sativa which means it's like a cross between you know like a head hotter body huh so it's pretty good if you want more information I'll link to a review of it in the description so make sure to go check that out if you want more information so to get in the story it's about 10:00 p.m. Thursday and my dealer hits me up and he's like hey man I got some really good [ __ ] right now my wakanda's because like it's blue dream so I do some research on it and get gather information pretty much I found out that it knocks you on your ass which in my opinion is a negative for me because I don't really like going to sleep it's kind of like wasting the high so I text my dealer back and I'm like I don't have any money right now but if I have any money by the end of Friday I'll hit you up so of course wanting to know more about it from someone who smoked it I actually went to school Friday and asked potent Bob from the original story if they had actually ever smoked blue dream of course they hadn't but in second period me and boat asked around the class because that class is full of stoners and this one kids like dude if it's royal blue dream it's some good [ __ ] like you need to get it it's one of the best ways I've ever smoked so going off this kids word we actually bought some later that day at like 10 p.m. but originally boat and Bob came to my house at 5:00 p.m. so we just chilled pretty much but within that time amount we was pretty much collecting money trying to get as much money as we could and somehow we ended up with a hundred dollars now I didn't know how much one hundred would buys at this point in Tom so I text my dealer I'm like how much for a hundred he's like seven grams so I was so hyped at this point that I [ __ ] ran maybe a quarter of a mile and four fad yeah I'm not really that fat but I mean like I'm lazy [ __ ] for someone who's lazy that's a lot that's a lot to run and by the way the walk backs up so story here if you get seven grams of weed don't get too excited run a quarter mile and have to walk back because it's gonna hurt everywhere so at this point we're pretty much just waiting and I actually texted my daughter I'm like hey can you put each gram a separate bag and he was nice enough to do it so 10 p.m. hits and my dealer pulls in the driveway and hands me the weed and then we go inside get seven seven different plates and break it up on those seven different plates now at this point I actually hadn't got my bong and this is another funny story that I may save so we're breaking up this weed and we have to wait for my mom to get home now and we're like already sort of high one because we're tired and two I'm pretty sure it was so powerful that we was in there smelling it pretty sure we got half that so I don't know it may have just been a placebo effect but I know it was some powerful weed so again at this point we're waiting for my mom to get there and when my mom gets there she rolls each of us two blunts I think I smoked one of my blunts and I was already [ __ ] high off my ass so I actually didn't get the munchies because at this point I had smoked so much I just don't get the munchies anymore and this weed in general just didn't give me an appetite so I didn't eat anything actually just went downstairs and chilled and listen to music and boat Bob were upstairs of course if you smoke a weed that's gonna make you fall asleep and then lay down you're gonna [ __ ] fall asleep so I sleep like maybe 14 [ __ ] hours and then wake up at like 8:00 p.m. 7 p.m. and boat and Bob are gone apparently they went home and I didn't know but my cousin was still there because he had came over and smoked with us to boatin Bob took one gram when they left but there was still pretty much like maybe 3 grams left I smoked one gram with my cousin and it knocked me on my ass again I would say I slept until 12:00 p.m. on Sunday so it was still pretty [ __ ] late so at this point on I have school in the morning and I smoke again except I don't fall asleep this time because I know I have school I tried to drink a monster to to sober up but it didn't work and I go to school and I was pretty much ha all of Monday cause for some reason this weed lasts a long time and it has so much THC like stayed in my system for 3 days so I wasn't actually not high until the end of Wednesday so for the end of this video I actually have a little added note for you guys since you watched all this way so before this I had ordered a bong expecting to smoke the weekend and they said it was gonna come in till like 14 days and I wasn't expecting it to but over the not when we smoked the weed and my whole house smelled like weed by the way the delivery man apparently delivered my bong so you know his ass was [ __ ] like at the door and he was smelling that [ __ ] weed because we had a window open so he obviously smelled the weed and he knew he had to know it's just a funny situation cuz I mean he had his ass had to know that we were smoking weed and he's like oh well just [ __ ] leave this bong here so it was kind of funny if you guys actually want to hear a story about the first time I smoked out of my bong then tell me and I will make one but until then I'm toasty dragon if you like this video then leave a like if you want more videos like this subscribe if you do either of those I'll send you a toastie dragon toaster and your toast will be perfectly browned and buttered for the rest of your life I'm toasty dragon and I'll see you guys in the next one peace he doesn't matter you know anyone", "LmBGsBkrFS4": "Hey guys welcome back to Greenbox Grown.\u00a0 My name is Dylan and today I am going to give\nyou an update on my Current Blue Dream Grow. \u00a0\nSo first off I want to give you some background info on this grow.\u00a0 I am growing 4 blue dream plants in this greenhouse\u00a0\nwith a coco coir / perlite mix and they are in week 7 of Flower.\u00a0 Also they are being grown in 7 gallon smart\npots, and I am using the Fox Farm Dirty Dozen Nutrients pack on these plants.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHere is a quick close up of these buds.\u00a0 And as you can see they are getting really\nfrosty and are starting to get some orange hairs at the top.\u00a0 What you cant see from home is the smell,\nwhich is incredible.\u00a0 I have always been a fan of the Blue Dream\nHigh and Smell, so I\u2019m stoked to finally be growing it myself. \u00a0\nI am currently growing through some pretty frigid conditions so that\u2019s why I have that\nheater in here.\u00a0 That little guy will actually allow me to\ngrow through snow if I wanted to. \u00a0\nYou can see a couple of our branches didn\u2019t make it through the SCROG so I used some string\nto hold them up a little closer to the lights.\u00a0 \u00a0\nI\u2019m really happy with the way these Lollipoping has held up through Flower.\u00a0 I have only had to trim it up once so far.\u00a0 Again here is another shot of how well these\nbuds have developed so far! \u00a0\nThat is all I have for now, but I will have an update on our Girl Scout Cookies Grow in\nthe next few days so stay tuned. \u00a0\nIn the meantime you can visit our website at greenboxgrown.com for the full step by\nstep grow videos on this Blue Dream Grow and more! \u00a0\nAs always, thank you for watching and please subscribe and comment below with your feedback!", "KxdXfPcW2DQ": "hey guys this is chanel at wiki Lee and today we're gonna talk about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a 50/50 hybrid with THC levels maxing out at almost 26% popular for its high THC value Mersin levels an incredible blueberry flavor this strain is commonly used for pain control total body relaxation and euphoric blitz from novices to connoisseurs this strain is popular among the masses receiving a 4.7 out of 5 stars on wiki lead I personally found Blue Dream to be extremely beneficial for relaxation both body and mind it's great for either a day out or a night in I give Blue Dream 5 out of 5 stars just want me to like a snippet that's really good very good it's very like fruity but also just like a hint of thyme basically like everything that I want cannabis to smell like is just like happening right in this nug that's good it's very good", "GCHJ5llFB84": "folks it's Grammy here my mom's place her plants been hanging for about a week and a half she informed me that she was bending some stems and they were breaking this plant is more than dry enough so time to get it out of here get into the trim bin trim it up weigh it up and find out the final results of mom's grow well there we go mom's first time in trim Jail fortunately the plant is quite dry as you saw not too difficult what do you think mom I'm pretty happy hey that's good the trim bin is doing its job keeping the mess contained there's such a wonderful wonderful product if you are a small budget grower and do some trimming and you don't have one of those I recommend you get one it's just it's great keeps the mess contained and it's got that little tray underneath to collect all the trichome heads that fall through the screen it's pretty awesome you know what I'll leave a link down in the description to Amazon I'll put an affiliate link down there and if you want you can go click on it and check it out maybe get one for yourself yeah I think I say awesome product Oh mom's trimming away grab this before she got too carried away with it and it's at the top of the plant not sure how well that's gonna show up it's pretty nice in there especially considering the stress that it was put under from being too close to the light for a while turn dude all right hmm not bad at all mom not bad at all Oh the trimmings almost done get it onto the scale see what the final results are Mary and mom cleaning off her Fiskars the trimmings done she's got herself a nice nice bowl of buds I don't know what did you think of we trimming mom okay you only had to do one little plan so that sir probably made a difference I'm glad you like it when I harvest mine maybe I'll get you over and you can help me I'll see ya there's all the trim in the trim bin see down below it's not a massive amount that there are some some trichome heads fell through well that's cool the little brush that comes with the trim bin sweep them up and make use of those one other little bonus with it I think the best feature is that it keeps the mess contained instead of well it's one little leaf on the floor but you could imagine the mess especially if you get a little dog they can get into messes enough cameras picking that up down there forty four point eight forty four 6:45 ceiling fan messing with the scale anyways put that paper plate on tear at the scale dumped all the buds on ya we're somewhere around 45 to 46 grams not bad not bad whoa folks this is a struggle here this this cannabis is so dry a little over dry perhaps so anytime they tried to touch it or do anything it just wants to crumble it's almost as dry as buying a buying weed from the government store it's pretty crumbly fortunately mom got herself some boba packs so we're gonna introduce those into the jars and hopefully that will increase the moisture in the plant it'll improve the texture and make it easier for mom to handle her buds when it's time to time to handle them over two packs to the rescue again folks I hope you've enjoyed this little video series of growing weed with my mom I don't know we've had fun did you have fun mom yeah just wanted to show that really anybody can do it you don't need to invest a whole lot of money we were lucky because the light was donated to us but yeah whatever it was just an auto flower seed throw the seed and some dirt and water pretty simple mom's got a nice little harvest to show for it so yeah that was what we really wanted to you know let people know that it doesn't have to be difficult it can be if you want it to be but it can also be pretty easy to grow some decent cannabis for yourself as I've mentioned I grew up blue dramatic as well and I will leave a card at the end of this video if you want to check that out and see the results of my plant and compare what mom did what I did and yeah maybe you're interested in growing the strain yourself just curious of what outcome you can expect so go ahead and click on that and we'll meet back in my tent sometime soon right thanks for watching", "tCRRCExC7XA": "what's up y'all so today we are doing a redo of my blue dream igtv so let's pop the pot in here's the pod the blue dream all right let's get into this so 90.77 thc for this blue dream um my first review on the blue dream i actually had to okay so i got a call mid review and then i was like oh my [ __ ] so it i couldn't end in the middle so i just redid it really fast that's why it's like four minutes it's really bad i didn't get a thumbnail anyway so i've hated it forever and i've just never redone it i was like [ __ ] it i'ma redo it so here we are redoing it 90.77 bluedream i haven't ripped one in so long so cheers y'all all right so straight off the bat you hate it you don't taste a thing and then you take your lips off that tip and it's just automatic flavor it's straight blueberry to the face it's amazing though so dude i haven't had in so long it's an amazing high too i was already high before i did this of course but this high so straight blue dream is like you're [ __ ] you're up there dude

video i'll show you exactly how i took this old tank and made it look like how you're looking at it now step one the original base of this was an old pine wood i took a sanding disc and completely took the shine off of all the surfaces that you can see step two i took a vintage white colored oil-based paint and laid it on the sides just using a standard brush i made sure that all sides had a nice coverage i gave it one coat lay it dry off and gave it an immediate second coat step three i went on amazon and got a marble pattern furniture vinyl wrap i laid it on this top part here i also laid it on the front doors as i was laying it down i had the feeling that i was being watched it was maximus hey man what are you doing out there man with that white stuff on that box oh look man these humans are so active nice one maximus of course this is all for your personal entertainment step four was the hardscape i used the old substrate to make two big mounds then i laid the original stones facing inwards within the two mounds and then i made a crevice straight through the middle and down the front to the right side this is where i'll be later laying the sand i also use the original driftwood i had in my old tank this will have the beneficial bacteria that i had in the old tank ready for the new cycle step five getting the sand in there i use this hugo kamishi decorative substrate natural sand no washing out required and i'll let you enjoy this part [Music] [Music] one pebble doesn't make a floor on your son [Music] this is the fun part ain't nothing to it but to do it now to be honest i could have took the driftwood out there made my life a whole lot easier but i thought it was such a pain in the ass getting it like that to start with i'd have trouble if i took it away so i just left it there as i laid the sand down [Music] now straight away you can see the sand becoming wet now this is all the water that's coming from the old substrate and all that beneficial bacteria straight away getting in all the nooks and [Music] crannies [Music] space constraints made it a little hard but i've had years and years and years of practicing this motion wrists like steel [Music] [Music] [Applause] then i took a circular paintbrush and just kind of evened it out at the front there i wasn't really going for a full japanese zen garden sort of look i want it to look natural i was really trying to make this look as natural as possible but still giving it a nice even base [Music] once that was all evened out then i took the rest of my sand and laid the rest over the top [Music] do [Music] so [Music] once all the sand was in i then took the brush one more time and just leveled out the front of the tank again not to make it look dead straight keeping that nice natural look to it and there you have it hardscape complete all the tank and base complete i was really happy with how this came out it's exactly what i had in my mind [Music] so [Music] step six time to fill her up oh yeah now i used the garden hose and pulled it from the outside in there was no fish in there so it didn't matter that was freezing cold i had my filter in there that i'd had for about five years at this time and had all the beneficial bacteria in there i was actually planning on keeping this and just really planting that area out so you wouldn't see it keeping the cost down and environmentally friendly as possible the great thing is is because the sand was already wet with the beneficial bacteria that came from the substrate it was completely clear i've seen plenty aquascape videos where completely clouds over so i couldn't be more happy that i nailed this but as it was smooth sailing around this time i started to notice something i put the filter on only to notice that the motor seemed to be gone [Music] is [Music] that's why we have step seven i've got this brand new marina tank from amazon for 21 pounds and filled the tank up completely [Music] i had my old condensation tray there but was perfectly hidden i also got a brand new light from amazon this was 90 centimeters long and perfect to light up the tank it was running like an absolute dream step 8 and everyone's favorite fish and plants we headed over to our local aquatic shop malden aquatics in bedfordshire to get our fish [Music] this is a fantastic cozy shop that has every fish you could need [Music] here they are polar blue parrots cichlids this is exactly what we're after but these guys here they're about eight months old and almost fully grown [Music] i just gave it a quick whip around the shop as this would be a whole episode if i filmed everything who doesn't love a pea puffer the other side of the shop has everything you need and everything you could think of when it comes to your aquarium it's got all your aquascaping needs here all your driftwood all different types of stones you can use for your aquascape it's got brand new tanks in here filters heaters everything you need [Music] this is actually what we're here for polar blue parrot babies now these guys are about two months old we've been coming in here since they were born seeing them [Music] step nine quick stop by jaws aquatics to grab some plants step 10 we added the plants in there and actually just before this we had a background delivered which was actually meant to go in the tank but it was polystyrene and it floated it was cheap from china so we got that on the back of there excuse the glare on the glass obviously we've got the light off because the fish are acclimating in there we got four of the babies in the end step 11 and my favorite add the babies to their new kingdom [Music] immediately started swimming around exploring the tank these guys were comfortable straight away they actually flared up blue [Music] [Music] so there it is the tanks start to finish rather than going out buying a brand new tank you can do this and make an old tank look just as good as a brand spanking new one [Music] step 12. enjoy your new tank [Music] i'd originally bought this tank about six years ago and when i bought it i bought it for 25 pound for the tank and the stand and the guy said it had been in the loft for about four years and he'd had it for about five years before that so again i'm just rounding it off to about 12 years but it could be 15 16 you know somewhere around that and it's uh you know it looks like it's just come out the shop [Music] me seriously [Music] foreign [Music] you", "4ef2zeetG7Y": "hey folks it's Grammy at my mom's place checking out her blue dream addict Auto flower she's got going this would be day 16 for it under the Mars hydro TS 600 light 16 days into it things are going well see the soils a little dry mom's just getting some water ready for it we're gonna give it give it a good drink and then I'm going to take care of some IPM little integrated pest management for moms plant we'll be adding some gnat Nick's to the top of the soil after it's watered and then we'll give it a spray of overgrow bioptic foliar so I'll pause the camera we'll get back on when its watering time we're back mom's got the water go ahead you know gently water around the entire pot give it a good drink and not not to plant or too much well sorry before when you're laughing isn't it how's that perfect alright you know pause it and go grab some of that Nick's alright then that next I'm gonna do this instead of mom the mask on just cuz it can be dusty you know apply a good layer of this maybe a quarter inch to a half inch thick all right let that dust settle and we'll get mom back in here to spray it with over girl that Knicks down the dust has settled so just for Mom and anybody else who doesn't know is not Nicks is a recycled glass product and what it does is it helps prevent fungus gnats and other little pests from going from out here into the soil or from in the soil out little baby fungus gnats will spend two-thirds of their lives down in the soil and then they'll try to come out when they do this will shred them so mom have you seen any little flying pests or anything yet no I haven't seen any wonderful that's a good answer hopefully that's the answer every other time I ask you as well so that's one step in our art our IPM our integrated pest management and it's the other step over grow from optic foliar I spray that on everything that I grow including my sunflowers and it's a pretty awesome product so this not only will provide a full year feeding to the plant and give it good nutrition that way it also helps to prevent mold and it also helps to deter pests so pretty wonderful product and the bottle over to mom if you want you can it's ready to go okay just hit the trigger give it a good spray soak those leaves okay that's good we can spin the pot and give it a little there you go yeah rotate the alright that's that pause the camera for a second okay I think that's it for this time we were gonna do some training but the plant doesn't seem to need much training right now pretty pretty nice structure to the plant I'll check back in a few days let that optic foliar overgrow do its job see how the plant responds to that and it might require training in a bit aside from that we might raise the Mars hydro tea s600 another inch or two maybe just compensate for the growth of the plant keep the same distance that it was yeah well check back at mom's place again in the near future and see how it's doing then well it's been a few days five days to be exact and holy cow mom's plant is doing pretty good seem to seem to like the over girl can see the the wingspan as wide as the pot now pretty good I brought my pH meter my TDS meter over I'm gonna just check mom's water just to satisfy my curiosity I'll pause the camera get it up on a tripod and carry on then all right got some of mums just water just give it quick quick test see see what it's at so ideally we would like a pH somewhere in the range of six point two to six point eight and that would be because at that level that's when the majority of nutrients are available for the plant to uptake at that level if the pH gets out of that range then some nutrients aren't available to the plant now we've yet to feed any nutrients in the water just whatever is in overgrow we've got a pH of six point nine six yeah so a little higher than we would like but that's not really the end of the world okay below seven that's good if it was up around eight then we'd be concerned [Music] and then this TDS meter measures the total dissolved solids it's sitting at 4:15 417 which I don't think is bad anyways yeah that was mostly just to satisfy my curiosity and put me on the spot and tested me thanks mom anyways I brought over my hygrometer and thermometer as well just also to satisfy my curiosity it's around 77 Fahrenheit in here Tangled 77 Fahrenheit 26% humidity dry it's winter in Ontario that's how it goes okay pause it and get reset up here all right now see the plant has been growing so it's about to be in about 12 inches from the light so I put mom to work mom can work those ratchet straps and raise the light up hold on to that see the loose one here and you know what maybe I'll do that for you yeah hold on let's let's prevent catastrophe okay there I took care of that for Mom you got the light back to being 15 inches away now accidentally hit pause there we had a executive meeting he's an executive decision that we're not going to do any LST on this plant instead mom's just going to do some leaf tucking so all that's gonna mean is this great big fan leaf here it's kind of covering up that little branch there yeah we'll just tuck the big leaf under same on the other side all right spin that around same with that one just kinda there you go excellent no yeah it might be over to look at you go alright all right that will do for now and that will be something that you know every couple of days you'll come in and see the new smaller branches poking up and you just move those big leaves out of the way just tuck them down under okay should be good but mums blue dramatic after three weeks looking pretty good we'll be checking back in another week or so and see how it progresses hopefully start some flower development soon yeah I had one of these blue dramatics as well and I was pretty happy with how it turned out if you would like to see that and my other Auto flowers I have a whole playlist dedicated to them and I will leave a card at the end of the video right here for you so click on it and I'll see you there", "BYqyDnyv0Ok": "[Music] [Music] which is my hello medical marijuana grow-ops and for those of you guys that haven't been following along and haven't really updated this garden in a while I think last time I updated it was when we flipped this garden to flower actually but you can see where we far surpassed that or actually I'm thinking around the sixth week in this garden now but for those guys that have not followed along this is a 6000 watt adjusting garden it's in approximately like a 10 by 20 space and there's 25 plants in here only intended to have 24 but I gave him one snare and he actually just threw it in the middle and she's got the biggest [ __ ] butt out of all of them which is hilarious but yeah there's 25 plants in here and you know things have just been looking really great you know the buds are getting big they're getting nice and frosty see I think I kind of briefly touched on the nutrients that we were running last time but I'll just kind of go roaming in really quick is we've got we're running the house and garden AME base with the bud candy at one point another we ran all of these the roots accelerator the budding so top booster don't think we're using shooting power this time we are using the overdrive but he also is running a liquid karma and hikers I'm you know but should get good stuff and you know with the addition of you know the three additional lights this grow I'm doing a mono crop style grow with all the same strain you know a little bit of updated on the the nutrients you know we definitely converted this grow to 100% cocoa like I've done in my rooms and it's made all the difference in the world for the success of this garden you know I've been really happy with the way this canopy has turned out you know it's really even and believe it or not guys this is only my buddy's second grow the last grow that I showed you with the Blue Dream in the purple cushion here under a few thousand watts was his first grow and that was really just with me helping him set up the garden kind of showing him what you need to do and you know do it himself and this time I haven't been here at all since the last video you know so he's done all six weeks by himself and yeah guys I mean it just looks great some of these buds are even bigger than ones I've done without co2 if you look at this big fattie thing definitely got some time to go looking great so basically what I extracted to do if you wanted me to see how far away they were from being finished and in my opinion there I think there are news that they're on bad day 43 or 44 in the moment so he's going to actually give these plants for one more feeding of the overdrive and after a couple days is gonna start diluting that solution down into just kind of reduce the concentration a little bit as we wind towards the end of this grow and yes so we are basically shooting for about a 60 to 63 day harvest in this room which is going to put it right on line with a lot of my other blue Dreamgirls in the past so you know I'm really excited to see the bro you know I think it's definitely more successful growth in the past so I think that's pretty much it you know he has added a couple small things you know we've got another fan of here on this wall now isolating you got another fan up there on that wall back there oscillating we also added in let's get back here got it in a an intake right here so all the we've got a the 8 inch exhaust back here in this corner and any negative pressure that's created is brought in through this fresh air duct here from the garage and then all of the air Kushner's and heaters are set on opposing schedules and what that means is you know that this small 12,000 BTU wall not on this side is keep that it keeps it cool when it's running or when the lights are on and during the winter time we've got this guy which is a 24,000 I think and that works as a heater to keep the room nice about 65 68 degrees during the lights-off cycle which is about exactly where you want it that helps keep the the blood density really nice and tight so that's basically you know all we've got going on in this grow you know it's gonna be a couple more weeks and then we should be looking at harvest and once we get the numbers and everything we will keep you guys all updated and I'm not sure exactly we're gonna grow in here next it's probably gonna be a company either of another round of you dream or the the Green crack I'm not exactly sure yet it's gonna really depend on my clone numbers cuz I just don't know what the hell I'm gonna do yet so yeah guys I think that's basically it oh yeah one other addition was I got a little diamond fire right here in the back just to keep things in check but the conditions in this room geysers awesome never emitting spike or temperature spike so these blue jeans are definitely doing very well very very happy with this garden right now so if you guys have any questions please let me know other than that we will see you guys next time you", "KoX9vDNBeyo": "[Music] what's going on YouTube Kerr MD and we're back over here as I am following up on the Blue Dream Green crack cannabis crow that we got going on in here and just wanted to take a little quick second to update you guys as to how the girl is going and some of our observations so let's just jump right into it first and foremost I think today's are either on day 43 I'll put the exact date in the video description but I think we've got about two to two-and-a-half weeks left in this garden about guarantee week of that will be one more week of feeding and then the next about ten days or so we'll be done with flushing and I got to say I'm pretty happy with the way things are coming in this garden obviously the disparity in terms of height is a little bit more evident when things start to really pack on weight I would say that these plants getting a little taller getting a little bit bigger bugs but I think they're seeing a little bit more stress from being taller and closer to the light than what I'm seeing down here in the shorter half of the garden come these these buds over here on the shorter half filling in pretty nicely they're not getting outrageously thick but they have more of a standard shape to them these buds over here you can see they're just huge in terms of the size I mean I can I can't grip them right now but they've got a little bit of fog feeling kind of going on the ends and I really do you think that's just because of co2 this room's been lower than what I've done in the past in my rooms but I think it might be sealed potentially a little bit better I'm not a hundred percent sure and I think it's just a lot of co2 in the room is really making the fox feeling going on we've raised the lights up a lot I don't think the lights particulars should be you know causing stress I'm leaning more towards co2 mainly from this this bud right here you can see this one he's kind of just flipping you off this little long awkward top right here this but it's tough it's absolutely huge I mean it's getting nice and thick and hard and everything but it's not anywhere near any of these lights you can see it's got a lot of distance it's essentially you're right in the center of all four reflectors but it's lower than the rest of them you know right next to a lot of other very normal-looking buds and even this guy right here is no taller and it's thicker doing just fine so that's why I'm leaning towards it being co2 so starting this week we're cutting the co2 back down to a thousand PPM's we've only been running at about 1400 in this room the entire time but yeah and so on top of that we're continuing along with our house and garden feeding schedule everything is basically the same application rates as the last video that I just made we are using the golden tree still and so far so good looks to really be helping these plants boost up I think it's gonna be a great yield in this room you can see just right through this section there are just a lot of fatty-fatty buds so getting really excited to see these things all cut down also I'll be making separate videos about this in the near near coming future but I have started making plans and diagrams or my personal little grow room project that I got going on so you know for those you guys stay tuned and expect to see some build-out videos and some design videos on that and I'll be doing some QA for those you guys I have questions but it's gonna be really fun for me so I hope you guys stick around check it out so yeah plan moving forward like I said ten more day or seven more days of feeding about 10 more days after that of just pure water on a flush and this should be ready to come down somewhere in the day 60 ish range we are kind of on the schedule here since my buddy over at site M is going on a family vacation right after this harvest is done so there may be gap after this growth is over with before you'll see anything else coming in this garden I may still make a video while they're gone about the results but we'll take that one step at a time you want to get too far ahead of myself since I'm really just just trying to keep up with everything that I got going on and at this moment right now so anyway I'm just gonna walk around really quick here show you guys some of the buds and they're all still want me to talk about a little bit more about what golden tree does golden tree is really it really helps the cell division so it's going to allow your plants to really replicate faster and produce more increase their overall potential and so far it looks like after only about a week or week and a half of getting bad nutrient added to our regimen in this garden you know these plants have really blown up it is quite characteristic of Blue Dream to explode around this time frame of the guard of the Grove but I definitely think that the train has done quite a bit to help the plants a curly green and healthy and really happy so far so those guys the all the info is still in my last video for those of you guys that want to still try out golden tree and like I said before you can get a 10% discount by using grower md checkout so i encourage you guys to give it a shot and see what it does for you guys so there may be some additional stuff coming along with this coming shortly but I will make another video when all that stuff comes so I think that's about it everything else has been quite on cruise control with all the automatic feeding and everything else I think since it's been a while since I made a video about the functional aspects of this garden when this grow is over I'll try to get in here when it's all cleaned out and show you a little bit of what the garden looks empty what we do in between cycles for cleaning and maintenance things like that to make sure our growth keep moving nice and smoothly and yeah I think that's it we'll go over the drip system then I know a lot of you guys have questions about this this manifold system that we got going on over here so that'll be in one of these next videos as well and if you have any other items that you have questions on or want to see videos made of please email me do not leave your suggestions and questions needs in comments apparently I get spammed by a shitload of people trying to sell cannabis on my channel through the comments I'm gonna be more diligent about banning those people so they don't continue to just spam the [ __ ] out of my comments but in the meantime try to focus all your questions to grower MD at gmail.com I'll have a lot more access to get back to your questions from that venue so that is pretty much it I want to rant a little too much here but like I said if you have any questions comments please feel free to let me know other than that see you on the next one you", "NUdNeQDnLZE": "join us for review of the vw passat gte let's go [Music] here the passage gte in the front since the facelift there's a more horizontal stress that leads over directly to the new headlamps led standard optional the matrix led and the gte of course special has this c-span data running light here in the lower part that's really impressive and the charging port is right here at the front the length is at four meters 77 15 foot six or 188 inches wheels are available from 17 to 19 inch these here are the 18 inch wheels so some a nice compromise and the normal suspension would start just at that even for the gte and option you get the dcc dynamic chassis control that the adaptive suspension where you have more variety between stiffness you know a little bit stiffer or softer you can pick it yourself in the driving modes and in the rear since the face-up you have a new tail-em design which looks more modern also when you use the braking light for example and if you have the matrix led option you also get cascading turning indicators both in the front and in the rear and in the lower part clear case for the autographed fake exhaust police hmm so the passage gte features a 1.4 tsi total petrol engine 218 horsepower system output maximum only electric drive up to 140 kilometers an hour or 90 miles an hour and now with a 13 kilowatt hour battery for more electric range so about 50 kilometers or 30 miles pure electric range and you know you can use that already very well 7.6 seconds is the acceleration figure when you combine both powertrains for the maximum output [Music] [Music] then since the facelift you have a new steering wheel with a new more modern design left side cruise control commands right side for the virtual instruments gte steering batch right there there's also you can really feel that flat bottom of that here are the optional digital instruments rumor about the screens and the seats for the gte in general for the massage you can get nice fabric seats and here with the gte they have a blue scheme in the inside fabric and also here with some contrast stitching in blue i would definitely stick with these these are also the ago comfort seats so they're really good option you can also get alcantara on the inside with the design package but then also the outside parts here would do with animal skin so rather thick with these and save the money and also have the best climate contacts getting inside is fairly easy and the cool thing about the passat is always it is very suitable for tall adults so the seats here really welcome also tall legs and long legs and so on so the passant would normally start with analog instruments still optional 11.7 digital instruments here updated since the facelift on the right side a normal facade would start 6.5 inch but that's already not standard for the passage gte the passage gte always started with an 8 inch screen and then optionally this one here 9.2 inch the biggest one available then with no knobs anymore the 8 inch one i would rather recommend that one the standard one because it still has a manual volume knob and also this zoom in and out knob for the gps map so needed to the screens since the face-up the analog clock is also gone then he replaced with this passat batch it doesn't look bad at all the integration using horizontal um in the events is also actually quite nice yeah but the clock also had something definitely the digital instruments here you can switch the view how you want to have it classic style or just the middle part whatever you want to have displayed here they're a little bit brighter than it appears on camera i just need to find you know should i speed the right one and um and so on that it doesn't flicker it does not no never flicker on you know human eye but sometimes it does on the camera so you're really flexible with adjusting these digital instruments that's the cool thing head up display is yeah somewhat nice to have but you see it's not directly projected into the windscreen but rather on this separate small plexiglass layer yeah i mean it's better than nothing but a passat should have a real one i think and here the infotainment system up close you can see here when you mix it with the fuel and the electric for example here 12 kilowatt hours more kilometers electric consumption and 2.5 liters or more kilometers so that's a mix but it really always depends on how you use that recharging there are special e displays that also shows you which range is left again 40 to 50 kilometers would be a realistic range in not winter times you can let the energy flow being shown to you here where the battery is placed also then front wheel drive only just remember there is a main menu like this and it's actually quite clear and easy to read but you can also individualize yourself a whole menu like this and in the rear this is clearly a family vehicle you have enough space also here with a manual shade then for the sun also soft touch materials at the inside very good build quality and you have a lot of legroom here left no problem at all also the nice blue cone stitching here at the back part and everything is softened up also the same you know scheme here in the rear for the rear compartment headroom also no problem especially with the estate there's a lot of headroom and so comfortable these rear seats i'm really feeling at home here well you do buy a passat for this to load things in and out very easily really cool with this estate this one actually goes forward when you open the trunk but you have to put it back manual then later on here in two steps but it has nice rails at the side the width here is about a meter and the normal length is already 1 meters and 15 and you can also fold the seats from here and you see they fold very very well and then you have a maximum length of yeah almost two meters right here so that's very very well usable so cool and also easy to put like mountain bikes in there when you mount the front tire and so on and here below that you can put it like this and then have for example like the storage for your charging cables hey what's up great you're here on our driving part thomas's driving lounge with the passat gte and of course the most recent facelift iteration of the passat right here and indeed this has some effects on the vehicle definitely the new steering wheel told you earlier is really cool as for the new form and for the modern design this also brings you know more premium touch to the vehicle so really like that and starting in the city um all electric of course is when the battery is charged somewhat then you always start in the e-mode and it's just so relaxing to start all silent the good noise insulation plays along with that in the d-mode when you lift the throttle the car is rather rolling usually you might also want to go to the b mode so that comes closer than to electric vehicle driving because then there's more recuperation so when go through then then there's recuperation and quite substantial so we have some plug-in hybrids even some evs which are not that strong others especially teslas for example have very very strong recuperation it's always a matter of philosophy if you rather go for like this one pedal driving feeling or more normal combustion engine car i like and here when you are in the b mode there's indeed substantial recuperation and i like that i think it's always a safety thing in the moment when you lift the throttle you're already decelerating before you go to the brakes and sometimes you can even leave it then with the recuperation just with lifting the throttle and that's fine then of course the car does also re do the regenerative braking when you hit the normal brakes and then when even more braking powers need the normal brakes are being applied but here in the b mode i think it's um you know when you're getting used to it maybe even more comfortable and suitable for that kind of vehicle here and if that here would be all electric i wouldn't mind either but of course it can be a good combination when you for example commute to work all electric short ways during the week and maybe take a longer holiday trip on the weekend then for example you know a plug-in hybrid might be the ideal solution when you're charging charging infrastructure is not perfect yet or you can like sometimes recharge or not that long so you know it really depends on the use case if the pf makes sense or not and i can distress again that driving it all electric is yeah the most fun you can drive with the facade right here really very very cool and gives you such an even more sovereign feeling the facade itself is one of the best mid-sized vehicles because you know it gives you a premium touch it gives you a premium driving feeling here with the optional dcc dynamic chassis control that's the adaptive suspension you should definitely go for that it adds so much more comfort and you're also flexible between like sporty and normal comfort driving modes 18 inch wheels we have mounted here you remember 17 to 19 available i would not necessarily go for the 19 inch they look cool yes but some someone also reduced the comfort so stick with the base 17 inch if you're okay with that visually for the best comfort then or 18 inch i think is a very good compromise between comfort and sportiness and we can of course also use all of the excel um additive cruise control systems and so on blind spot monitor we show you more of that when we hit the motorway very soon we go on the motorway test some adaptive you know all the assistant systems and then also do a high speed test see what about the all the electric driving 140 kilometers or 90 miles maximum then just the combustion air in combination with combustion engine so the electric motor itself cannot run any faster it's also predominantly thought for the low speed driving then here i have the head-up display which is not projected into the windscreen not updated with the facelift here in the separate layer i mean it's somewhat helping definitely better than looking down to the virtual instruments but i've got of course not such a sophisticated feature in this case even if we're here in the all electric mode by the way i have some substantial acceleration only if i really floor it out so there's this threshold i can see it in the instrument and also feed it a little bit in the pedal then the combustion engine would hop on most of the time you'll find and with driving all electric here and then it's also about the consumption of course yeah always hard to tell with plug-in hybrids always telling that pure electric range 40 to 50 kilometers so around 30 miles will be less in winter times when really really cold and when the battery is completely depleted you score normal combustion engine consumption here because you have more weight on the other hand on the other hand you can still use recuperation even if the battery is not recharged from the outside so seven so like six to seven liters or more kilometers with empty battery and that's like about like 40 mpg 48 mpg uk or something yeah so that still works but of course it can just really make sense when you recharge them frequently and then you can also combine these power con you know they like these conduction figures and maybe have like a very low leader figure and some electric consumption as well and now i'll just combine the acceleration 40 kilometers an hour and let's go [Music] that's 180 180 kilometers hour and i think yeah really decent acceleration definitely and [Music] i mean it's a small displacement figure as for this engine but still some nice sound and even at 160 kilometers an hour still decent as for the noise insulation as for the wind noise and so on and gives me such a stable feeling here on the road as well let me do a lane change at higher speeds no problem of course this car is not set out to be a sports vehicle but it really is fun to drive and i mean you can set this dc either here in the sport mode that is a little bit stiffer then like this or if you go for the comfort mode um do a lane change you feel the cars shaking a little bit more but then again it's evening out the bumps a little bit better and thus you can just adjust your driving mode the preferred ones and with the facelift here also when you go to the individual settings um yeah probably shouldn't do that while driving so um don't repeat that here again the dcc with this span between comfort and sport and you can individualize which your preferred setting really is and now to our conclusion for the day with the vw passat gte yeah i think it's the most interesting version because it gives you the electric driving feeling and driving it all electric is the most fun definitely of course it makes sense when you can recharge frequently and then drive as often electric as possible and also substantial or like range with about 40 to 50 kilometers or around 30 miles that's totally okay or you use it in the hybrid mode and have a low fuel consumption or use then the combustion engine on the motorway whereas you use the electric drive in a city then it really makes sense also the styling i mean it's rather a conservative car in general but i think the styling is rather timeless the facelift changes were also quite nice more infotainment also on the interior and of course here for the gte a bigger battery for the higher range we mentioned earlier definitely still among you know one of the best mid-sized vehicles when we recently compared the bmw 3 series by the way yeah that one does have a better ride it's sportier it's more fun the suspension even the base suspension is better than the dc suspension right here and of course the beam launcher 3 series also even more you know coast intensive than this one even here as the gt but just in our small hint because we recently had also the 3 series for a longer period of time then we also like to draw some comparisons you also have substantial space here on the insta on the interior very nice fabric seats here with

because of you I seen it and I was like yo this is some shiny with a lot of shy it's not nothing I would wait like Elvis yeah even my homie was looking at me when I got it like I was just like cuz you're gonna see you're gonna see you hear me today today we're gonna be talking about a super super super sativa hear me I'm talking super sativa [ __ ] this city but that [ __ ] superpowers here man we won't be talking about sue\u00f1o sue\u00f1o is a sativa dominant cert evil a sue\u00f1o is a cross of Sour Diesel and Blue Dream playing example Sour Diesel blue drink when you pop the top got some respect on the pop at the top sour sour skunky superscope got some blueberry action going on little feeding sue\u00f1o super super sativa this [ __ ] testing right here this [ __ ] see 39.1 so uh I guess yeah I mean without further ado let's jump right into this to the Super City but sue\u00f1o yeah hope everybody having a beautiful blessed day stay in Co V free my G that's like I'm a little

I'll deliver without the liver oh that's hot oh that's our whoo that's op that's plunger hmm a super skunky wait I can't really taste like no blueberry you smell a blueberry won't taste another doing oh that's extremely sour Brown anybody that likes our strands anybody that I like them skunky easily strands yeah man swing you know I thought it was gonna be a little sweet smell of sweet it smelled like sweet and sour yeah a shout-out to another city but that is like dope is finicky Remy I know y'all y'all know I left with the sativas but there are a couple of them that you know I will get a respect to is one I gotta get my respect to the air me sage and sour I gotta get my respect the sage and sour say Janice I was like you know I like me like this I like me I only care facade with you movies that some others said yeah I mean that's a whole other decay that's another type of blue like these like no you get real New York diesel and it's like darker yeah me we like them stupid like the damn red hairs are so dark they then they look Brown here I mean I know you got some real New York diesel breath don't bring me some lime green [ __ ] that look like it got cocaine sprinkled on it oh that's not New York visually but you're trying to play but uh sage and Sawa is like the perfect mix of these yeah I mean like seasons always like the perfect diesel strength like that taste on that sue\u00f1o I wish it had a little bit more I wish I had some type of blueberry taste I'm gonna say a little bit more cuz this tastes like mad a bit of blueberry but I wish it did have a little low blueberry action going on shout out the name I feel like me we like this shot because because this is definitely so you would like nevermind cousin hash when you're out of smoke swing your pressure to the lungs okay that [ __ ] is pressure to the lungs I'm struggling itself right now I'm struggling not to cope hear me that's how you know it some pressure to the lungs it was definitely some pack yeah me I can't be biased man I can't be biased because I'm I ended yeah yeah I like the Indies yeah but this sue\u00f1o is definitely looking in feeling and presenting self S&P a there's a win sue\u00f1o is definitely a dub if it's some PA CC it's pressure to the rust and it's pack is smell almost similar to hide taste just without the little bear at ease you got to gotta get a respect to where it's doing that they say no [ __ ] I'd be smoking on a daily I can't wait to get rid of this cuz I might hit what about home is up yeah all he do is do the city won't even smoke in because he just don't do it he'll do a hybrid he want to smoke no OG Kush for the record somos folks don't think I was lying I had that a black charity I had the black cherry cookies in the video I told y'all I was gonna double back in my last review I said I was gonna double back for that black cherry cookies guess what cuz I doubled back for that black cherry oh you know what else I double back for - hmm that dosha that gorilla dosha don't be lying cuz I know y'all can't see it but I just like to put the proof up there yeah double back for that dough [ __ ] I tried to double back for the hills og I tried to double back for the hills og but they was out it was out but they was out of the hills oh gee right remember I told y'all that the cookies cost a little bit more that black cherry cookies cost a little bit more right cut a little deal on it here and I cut a little deal here deal shout out to me shout out to the sue\u00f1o I'm not shouting out blue dream and I'm not shouting outside with diesel but I'll shout out to sue\u00f1o those two cross together hear me definitely a really good high two but this is the main reason I don't like sativa it really make me feel like I got Botox done yeah I mean just make my face just it just make my face felt funny and only time I really like smoking on a sativa is when I get these little migraines in the back of my head ache cuz I got a little brain issues and [ __ ] but other than that here I'm left with the sativa too much mmm let's somebody pop up with it somebody pop up with it out of respect if I like it imma [ __ ] with you I'm gonna smoke it with you hear me y'all tried to be safe I hate this court see these my asking [ __ ] it a really working brain ain't really protected if you ain't got like one of them real sports mascara like meant for running and doing wild activities outdoors your masters if you could blow a light out with your masculine your masters works this and like I said just just think about it

your Grammy thanks for clicking on my video just having a quick peek at my garden that's not why we're here today we're here to go check out my mom's garden she phoned me let me know that there's a little bit of trouble that Mars hydro light is more intense and we gave it credit for the top of her plant is getting a little bit caught yeah things are good in there we'll save that for another video time to get over to my mom's place we're gonna level looks great ish yeah all right the camera month thanks alright and see these leaves up top look like they've suffered a little bit probably from being a bit too close to the light slightly faded a little little crunchy on the tip there the lower leaves are still green and lush huge so anyways mom's light raised up a little more hopefully that'll prevent any more issues at the top all right Oh checking out down near the bottom let's see a few of those lower leaves I've had enough of living so my Fiskars mom time to time to go to work remember to remove the cover off those for your protection and slide that down I go all right and then just snip those close to the trunk you don't have to be right flush so we'll just get those rotted leaves out of the way they might attract pests or something so you don't need it huh what do you think well I see as well all right well here we go so it's day 52 today we're expecting the plant to go about 80 days yeah other than a little bit of light bleaching at the top from being too close to the light things seem to be going okay for moms blue dramatic a little flower uh you know what how about I show you something let me pause the camera and get out of this closet and show you what the heck mom's done now folks do you see that yeah mom went and bought a little tiny to buy to grow tent she's up aren't you mom hey Scotty reel was right cannabis is the gateway to gardening so but you know I once heard that having the ability to grow your own food is like being able to make your own money mom's sick of buying lettuce so you got try growing some how cool is that and we'll have a nice little tent to hang up a harvested cannabis plants in about 30 days a mom all right I just wanted to show you show you what's happened mom's full-on indoor gardener all right here we are now day 56 and things haven't gotten worse haven't gotten better just kind of kind of the same yeah I still think that late might be a bit too close to the top of the plant even though it's only a 100 watt light it's just a little too much to be that close but it's a little too weak to get down to those flowers down at the bottom so I brought some bamboo stakes over hopefully we can get this branch propped up a bit and yeah get those flowers a bit closer to the light for the last couple weeks of the plant's life so alright so a few things to do we're gonna raise the light again a few more inches and then get the stakes in there get those lower branches up a bit higher and yeah we'll go from there okay there we go got the light up at two stakes in any way supporting those lower branches that's good hopefully they're gonna produce great big fat flowers that would get so heavy they would need support but yeah you can see it's got those those flowers much higher and closer to the light than they used to be the top of the plant it's pretty damaged unfortunately yeah I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out keep things going see there is some some trichome development in there that's all right unfortunate that the top of the plant took on the damage so there's going to be any loss from that damage it will probably be from both there they're up where most of the the light burn and the bleaching and it occurred yeah unfortunate but not the end of the world because there's still all those other buds and flowers growing down here mum sent me a text she was a little concerned it's one big old fan leaf down here colour starting to fade and you can see something going on there she was just not sure what I think is happening is just the plant is going through the flower stage and hasn't been given any nutrients so it's probably starving probably cannibalizing itself a bit sooner than we want it to really so I asked mom if she had any plant food she's got this stuff here we're gonna just watered the plant yesterday it's gonna be a couple days before she needs to water it again but she's going to add some of that plant food to it and hopefully that will slow down this early fading that seems to be happening again it's just the largest and lowest fan leaves so I think it's just the plant using all that can out of them and then once that plant has been used or once that leaf has been used up and it can be removed and those leaves down here they can get the light and they can be used up so yeah may be time for a little bit of select defoliation yeah especially now that I got those other branches tied up it's getting a bit more crowded in there alright well yeah I'll get some scissors trim away those leaves get back at it alright there we go got rid of some of those large decaying leaves a bit more space a bit more airflow in there yeah there is uh get mum to feed the plant a couple days from now and then we'll check back in a few days after that see how the plant has reacted and see if we need to put in any more stakes to support these other lower branches but I think leave it there for now so", "4dQOYfRKadg": "what up YouTube their boat on the last stay here before I chop these be beauties down let's check them out this morning they did have some amber trichomes on them I turned off the boom light there just on the veg we right now on some things ugh laughing I don't know if I have the right spectrum blue but they said if you run them under the blue light for a little while supposed to help them do something sir so I just turned it to blue here both I was only a couple hours for but I'm gonna be chopping them down here shortly but just let me take a look at them before I put the axe to them I'll try to get some pictures of them after I turn the blue light off so we can see what color they are but naturally incandescent sort of say LED lights that are incandescent colors okay I'm gonna turn off this blue light they turn the fire when I turn the one off on this side and I'm gonna bring in just a regular light there you go I got a light on this when Agabus over later it up in here very much does it I got this lay down it doesn't doesn't do too much I don't think the 9 watts is lights up the whole a part of our you but I have it out there get you some actual colors on these I guess and I'll be the next let's go to the video I'm gonna take down the trellis net and then I'll be cutting these girls down okay this is what the Viper spectra just a600 running put the grow and bloom light both on whatever is supposed to be 12 bands I got the spec info somewhere but I don't have it in Omni handy so that's all the bloom one moon of it have you got a little light on this camera that's shining too so that may affect itself when I get close to up he's back on bed the veg is on the bloom is off like I said I do got a light on this camera that's small that when I get close it's gonna light it up and I pull back like this it'll be just probably the the blue from the viper spectra 600c Walker on the other side I took the trellis net off it didn't take too long but it was only the one net just to spread him out some when I found out they were photo periods and not Auto flowers I mean there are probably shark for a photo period but you know I low stress training them and I'm like this is what we got out of her I'm gonna be it took down the one light I'm gonna take down this light I'm gonna have to use this room for my dry room for 10 to 14 days and then I'll be taking these out of here and putting in some Northern Lights get you guys some looks at these birds and seal biggie that eyes but compared to my hand but I got out the pruning shears and I'm getting ready to chop them down I got that one job done and three more to go yet she is are we taking this one next now we got two of them chopped down and hanging I'm gonna leave this fan up here running on like number one we'll see if that works old I might have to turn it up to number two or something whatever I got a side to that is what I'll set it out to get air flow through this room and I'm gonna have this room closed tight well not tight it's got air flow through it better so it's dark I got time to we'll be next okay we got three over that's the last one that was the rent to the litter in the back these ones I'm gonna have to hang the second one up a little better when I get this last one out of here I'll be below him spread out where they need to be honorable hook all right that's all four of them chop down that why don't you come around to the fireside here we'll take a peek at that last one in the back I just wanna just chop down so we're gonna close this up let them dry for what ten to fourteen days and then they'll be doing a trimming video turn out this late this is just light on the camera now thanks everyone for watching please give me a like subscribe leave a comment gotta hang that late back up leave a comment ask a question hit the notification bell give me a subscribe I'm gonna be pulling these over the room here probably vacuum or up or clean it up a little bit with something and sweep it up let these bugs dry thank you everybody for watching my video series and like I said we'll have one more trimming I'm gonna pluck off some of these fan leaves and stuff them and everybody have a good one", "yPGR0OavHVw": "[Music] [Applause] you this is the blue dream deep cartridge it's almost done now I do want to know that good supply is also an affray accompany so a freons like good supply is a Frias over the counter or recreational brand so a lot of the terpenes are very similar to the ones that they have all in there wait for the actual medical prescriptions which is kind of interesting but I do find this one works a little bit better ice it's similar to like a Churchill as far as I find it gives me an indica of fact it makes me sleepy I can't really focus very much this one's supposed to have a very flavor to it I don't really feel that it's very berry eat it is sweet though it does say on the profile for it or the description that it's supposed to be sweet flavored why do you find it is fairly sweet so I woke up from that one but overall it is good I actually have a migraine and will probably use this to take a nap this afternoon because I have a migraine and I'm going to try and get some rest in because there's a thunderstorm coming and hopefully it won't wreck my body completely so so I will use this to help me with sleep and nausea I will try to sleep it off this migraine so as far as what I use this again yes I would I would use this one again I even think I might like this one better then the \u00e1free\u00e1 better than the Africa cartridges or at least not all not all of them because I really really like the Aspen but as far as and I teach the potency one I think I like this one better than the one that you can get on the prescription five for sure [Music] [Applause]", "Rf2bjmTjlGw": "thanks for joining us back with paleo talks this week we have christina veron ortiz very happy to have you how are you doing christina i'm doing good thank you blaine i'm happy to be here with you guys and i'm happy to be here with the audience everyone that's watching from the lab universities wherever you are yeah all over the world and then chris you can see he's drooling he's over there thinking about the mammoths and the mastodons and he's happy we're having another mammoth talk today um it was it was not my devious plan at all but it just worked that way and david we'll go over you for a bit to talk about the show and how it works absolutely we're going to stick to our typical schedule we're going to spend the bulk of the program with our guest giving a talk today about mammoths like blaine said and then once the presentation is done we're going to open it up to questions from the audience so as the presentation winds down we'll remind you to go ahead and leave your questions in the comments of the facebook uh comment section of the video and the end of the program will just be q a with our guest from the audience and as always if for any reason you can't leave a comment on facebook i'll be keeping an eye on the gray fossil site twitter and instagram accounts so you can send us a message there as well now before we get started i want to tell a very short anecdote and this i think will make blaine very happy uh the other day i went to the grocery store to pick up groceries and the woman who came out of the store to give me my groceries saw my name on the page and said do you do paleo talks and i said yeah she said that she watches paleo talks so hello to that person who recognized me at the grocery store thanks for watching fantastic that's a first for sure [Laughter] and we're on episode 41 is that right that's right yeah incredible incredible and it was shortly after this time last year yeah that we started so we'll continue going and again we're being brought to you by the center of excellence in paleontology at east tennessee state university here in johnson city which also has the extraordinary gray fossil site this this place that everybody should come and visit when you get the chance five million year old locality we don't have mammoths but we do have mastodons and it'll just blow your mind come visit us when you can and i'm blaine schubert and let's just move forward and hear about christina and christina what we usually do is we have our guests tell more about your background and how you got into paleontology in the first place so what interested you when you were younger yeah so i'm i'm from mexico so i was born in a town that's called that's called zacatecas in central mexico and since i was a little kid i remember being fascinated by dinosaurs i'm prehistoric animals when i was 12 years old my father got accepted to do a phd in the united states so we went to amherst new york so he went to university at buffalo uh suny at buffalo and at the time i remember that first time when we were there i was just playing around in the back backyard of our house and i picked up a few rocks and later the following day actually i was looking at them and one of those had a tiny fossil it was a bracupon uh quite small very small and i still have that fossil at home well with my parents in mexico and um that's what really got me hooked into paleontology at that point i told my esl teacher about it uh because i was going to summer camp uh for esl at the time and then she told my science teacher a great science teacher who's gonna be my teacher for the next next year and he approached me that first day of class after class and and told me so i heard that you like fossils he was a geologist by training so he mr schlesi he he passed away a year and a half ago or so but he was the best mentor that i've had so he gave me all of his college books uh they were from the 1950s of course but they were still i was still fascinated by them so he allowed me to take one of the microscopes from school take home and look at the puzzles that i had and that i was finding and we also went on fossil collect collecting trips so that was um that's how i got started into like really got hooked into clientology and my parents also really encouraged my my interests so yeah and where did you go to university i went to so we went back we we lived in the united states for four years then i went back to finish high school in the us it started in mexico and that's when i got hooked on the quaternary because one of my uncles has a farm and close to what his his farm is they were finding some mammoth bones and some camel bones and horse bones and so i went to take a look there with my cousin so that's what brought me to the the near time i guess into the questionary from the paleozoic and i went to the university um in a vasculentes uh to study biology so that's in a city of mexico too and then i moved to canada uh to calgary in 2009 to do a master's which then turned into a phd and then i i started working at the museum in edmonton in 2015 and i think here since since then yeah so it's gonna be six years almost yeah so that's my journey in as far as how i got to where i'm at right now wonderful i love how you said it hooked on the quaternary i think that's a really deep set hook that many of us get and you can't really get out of that once that hook gets you well i think the quaternion is quite interesting because it really it bridges the past in the present it's like and it overlaps with a lot of disciplines like archaeology um well archaeology and yeah i'm collaborating with some with some colleagues on i'm looking at uh and domestic horses too which is quite cool yeah wonderful all right well thank you for sharing that history thank you god if you want to go ahead and share your screen yes um let's do this i think the quaternary is a what we call a treble hook it's uh one of those three prong hooks why is that i guess oh i just mean that you really uh you get hooked um and you can't really escape that hook you're you're set for life when you fall in love with the quaternary yes yeah i agree okay um can i start now when yes please do yes okay so uh the title here of my presentation is mammoths on the move understanding the possible records of mammoths in alberta canada and right off the bat so this is a project that i'm working on in collaboration with uh chris jazz from here also from the royal royal i'm from tasha camach she's my former former lab mate from the university of calgary and right now she's in working at caltech in the united states so yeah this is a project where we're working on um plane i just want to ask you a quick question because i is your on your screen is our face covering part of this light or is it it is should i move it looks perfect i can just i can just see the uh the mammoths oh okay i wasn't sure if you can because i can see you and i i can also see you over in the corner as well but the screen it doesn't really it's good it doesn't cover this line okay yeah so um here in north america uh for the prices in different species of mammoths have been named over over the years uh but in interesting uh most research most current researchers uh identify at least two species for mainland and north america or and um and they were the woolly mammoth of course is um probably one of the most iconic animals of the ice age that's what usually people think about when they think about about the ice age they have this long woolly holy coat they were shorter than the than the colombian mammoth a bit smaller well smaller than the colombian mammoths and also their distribution as you will see i have a map they were wooly mammoths were distributed more in northern latitudes and the colombian mammoths were distributed in more southern lands and there has been a lot of more recent exciting research going on about about their relationships and the genetics aspects of them so there is a recent paper that has uh that is suggesting that um the columbia moment is a hybrid species we also have some evidence between of well hybrid species of hybrid between the wooly the wooly lineage and another lineage that morphologically appears to be similar to the step mama there's also other evidence of hybridization uh during the late pleistocene between the colombians and the woolly mammoths so all this is introducing us introducing more complexity about about their boundaries um as species or and also about um complexities about understanding their relationships as well as like the morphological uh aspect of them as i mentioned before so the um only mammoths are distributed in northern latitudes this map i i just took from neotoma the neotoma database it's not comprehensive because of course if you look further south into mexico there's not a single dot in us because this database started uh with the united states and yeah colombia man was extended further south into central america but but even though it's not comprehensive i wanted to show you this map just to highlight that difference in their distribution where the woolly ma the woolly mammoths indicated by the red triangles have this northern distribution and the columbia mammoth indicated by the green circles are distributed more than in lower latitudes of north america and so the area that is now alberta which i'm highlighting here on the map uh that area is as you can see it's it's located in that um where traditionally that um the area of overlap for these two types of mammoths so i mean only members extended further south but as far as as colombian morphology that's about the limit of the range there's a few specimens from up in the yukon that have that are have a morphology similar to the colombian mammoths but i know some researchers like lester and lisa and sheridan they identify those as struggling terri so the step moment and and that's because well um colombian mammoths as far as the morphological t and the stem mammoth are quite similar so they they do overlap a lot uh morphologically but um but the genetic system allowing us to uh provides a different perspective into their relationships it does look like there's a green dot up there in the it is actually yes so there's um yeah it's behind well it's behind the red triangle and yeah in yotoma that dot is um identified as assam with this columbine but i know uh yeah that in in listening sharing their publication in 2015 uh they have that specimen from the old crow area and other parts of the yukon and alaska as mammoth strogantera um anyway so going back to alberta uh so this area is interesting too because um we would expect like over the the geologic over the history of throughout the quaternary we would expect those environmental changes happened in this part of north america that the ranges for these animals will shift up and down and that populations might move further north of populations with like a morphology of of colombian mammoths and populations of of woolly woolies would shift further south and and this is a working hypothesis because there's evidence for other animals about this complex biogeographic um dynamics that are happening during the quaternary um yeah so the area that that is albert is at times formed part of this passageway uh that connected bernie to the north and and the rest of the continent to the south and and before we went we started we went on live uh chris with kennel and i were talking about the mastodon so there's a recent study um that was published last year by kariminsky and all looking at animastrons from um from different parts of north america looking at the dna and their study seems to suggest that during interglacial periods so during warmer times as more forested environments move further north and even into rangia then that masters extended their distribution uh further north but as um the climate got colder and and drier and those uh forested environments started to disappear uh some of those well some of those mammoths some of those populations were luckily were locally extinct a few of those may have survived for a little bit further north in in beringia in a few refugees but eventually uh it appears that the climate got so cold that there those forester environments just weren't there as as we were approaching the last glacial maximum and so so yeah so there's this clearly shows that um there's this complex and dynamic um aspects within the distribution of the of the mastodons in this case their biogeography we have seen similar things for other animals like like bison for example that after the last glacial maximum after the the ice started to melt and there was this corridor forming that uh populations of from the north started to move dispersed further south into what is alberta and populations from the south started to disperse north so that here in alberta during the post lgm so the post glacials so about like 14 000 years ago we started to see uh show up in the record animals with genetic affinities to the north and genetic affinities to the south so so oh yeah and this area has also been suggested as one of the other potential routes by which people dispersed from um asia into brain gender into north america the other drought of course being the causal crowd and there's still there's a lot of research going on about this um a specific issue um some people really favor the custom crowd because it appears based on the timing that we see people further south in north america and into south america that that maybe that that central route the corridor was closed but anyway but there's still a lot of research going on also in that in that topic and that's why this area is also interesting because of that dispersal of people so so that passageway um was relevant not only for animals but also for yeah peoples in the past and so so yeah so that's why um in our study we wanted to see at the morphology specifically so it's a morphological study the one that i'm going to talk about today and look at how the woolly morphologies and the colombian morphologies are distributed in alberta and and in time and space so this is an ongoing project so i'll show you some of the results we have for the morphological analysis and we have some results for for some dates uh but we still need to get a few more dates on on on the specimens we looked at but but yeah our hypothesis is that we will see these shifts in the distribution of the woolies and columbine morphologies through time and space in what is now alberta and so muhammad remains here in alberta so in the the map on the left shows um these are probability localities localities for for alberta for the province most of these localities are for mammoths we have there's very few mastodon sites and macedon specimens so yeah so most of those dots are for um thermometer means a lot of the remains here that we find here in alberta diet are quite fragmentary so we find a lot of isolated teeth isolated vertebrae and portions of tusks for example and that's because a lot of the specimens are found from uh fluvial deposits from these high energy deposits especially suns and gravels and a lot of them have been found as um industries and gravel industry as they're extracting and putting blades in the ground to extract all of this material they come across fossils and um chris my supervisor and our predecessors still here at the museum have built a strong relationship with the center gravel industry that they they typically contact us whenever they find some some bones and then we can we can go out there collect them and see if they're in section we can we can see them in place although in these high energy environments um a lot of the specimens sometimes are reworked and that's why they're quite beat up and fragmented but christina are these glacial outwash deposits then uh no well there's some glacial i watch deposits uh the one she here shown in this picture this was um a valley film so it was um this was a pre lgm before the last glacial maximum so it's um around the elementary area so there was some it was part of the old uh north saskatchewan river or or where the old uh course for the river yes and oh yeah so here's a picture this is of course it's not a mammoth specimen it's part of a bison four chord but i just show you i wanted to show you this picture just to show you how we typically see them on site uh this is at a gravel pit in northern alberta and so yes a lot of specimens are quite beat up but nonetheless there's still a lot of information we can get from those specimens from other studies we know that dna preserves well and also we can depending on how complete they are we can do some morphological analysis yeah looking at those gravels and how rounded they are it's amazing you have anything left exactly yeah this particular specimen i was surprised that it was like that it survived because yeah looking at looking at that and you i would think that it would get just destroyed yeah occasionally we do find more complete specimens rarely but they do exist like this juvenile mammoth mandible that also came from those fluvial deposits and um and also we have one associated specimen so this is um this is with the most complete malware specimen we have in the collections so it was found before our time before we started working here at the museum in the 90s so our predecessors uh were notified by the gravel pet company that they had found some some bones so when they went out they didn't find them in place they had already a lot of them had already been extracted but based on the the elements that are preserved based on the fact that they were so close together in in in that area of the gravel pit and also based on the fusion of the bones it appears to be that they're all from the same animal so this is um this is so far the most complete specimen we have here that has come out of alberta but like i said a lot of the specimens are fragmentary um we have several teeth and that's because well these teeth are hard and durable and they preserve well and and for this talk and also they're relevant because the distinction between the different types of mammoths has relied heavily on the morphology of the teeth and so so it's good that we have some some deep study um this one here is an upper tooth an upper tempering so the last smaller took them out um as shown here in this diagram is the diagram for a lower m2 a lower second molar and i just want to put out this diagram to show you the main features of of mama team so those numbers are what are called plates or lamella amelie um so yeah mama teeth have an elephant teeth to have this series of of planes on on the teeth and um the picture on the right is showing the tooth from the occlusal surface so they surface that the chewing surface so yeah there's one plate then the there's the enamel so all of those loops are enamel bands on the inside of the loops is the dentin and then on the outside we have cementum uh surrounding those enamel plates and um mammoths as well as elephants are quite quite cool because of the way that their team erupt and how the teeth they have so i love this this picture this is a specimen this is a picture that i took when i was visiting the natural history museum in paris france and it's a wonderful specimen because it's it's it's a modern asian elephant uh is the head so the front part of the head is to the to the left and the back of the head is to the right and then we have a cross section across the head and we can see the t and we can see how um we can see the last premolar and the first molar and in in mammoth as well as elephant elephants um the teeth were being replaced as as the front teeth was being born there was a new coming behind it and just pushing it forward and being replaced so so they they're pretty strange in that sense they're quite unique and so yeah so for uh i mentioned like i mentioned before so the teeth have been used to and to separate the different types of mammoths and so one of those features that the researchers have looked at is the number of enamel plates so woolies um shown here on the right have more of those enamel plates than colombian mammoths on average also the spacing of the plates uh in the woolies they're more tightly packed than in the colombian mammoths and the thickness of the animals and other features so that in the woolies they have thinner enamel bands than in the colombians on average all this one on average because the overall as you'll see they overlap quite a bit um in our analysis what we looked at um since oh yeah well i guess i'll show you the question so what we're interested in in in our studies to look at the how much variation is in the teeth um that we're finding here in alberta so we have only wooly morphologies we have columbia morphologies we have are there any like intermediate morphologies of the two and also we want to know how they are distributed in time and space are there any differences uh between woolies and columbine morphologies like do they co-exist at some places are they like contemporaneous or is the distribution disjunct geographically and in time and so the measurements we looked at so we we a little bit a lot of our specimens are not complete or they're quite they're worn beyond beyond the point where you can estimate the total the total number of plates in an unborn tooth so we couldn't really do the play count so the next um the next two things we you can look at is the spacing of the enamel um so we do that by looking at something that's called lamellar length which is length between one plate and one cementum interval and you calculate that through different measurements on the teeth and then the other thing we looked at was the enamel thickness measured at different points of the tooth and we also measure the width the maximum weight of the tooth uh because with the weight we could standardize the measurements and calculate some indices so the laminar length index and the enamel thickness index those are standardized to a size uh tooth size of a hundred upward of a hundred millimeters and standardizing those the measurements allows for more consistent comparisons between teeth of different sounds and so for our analysis of what we looked at specifically so we looked at the lamellar length index and the enamel thickness index and we use um data sets that have been published including the data set of lister and share from 2015 and the data set by wood guy at all from 2017 and in this talk i will show you the results of the data set from listener share [Music] and so here's i'm gonna walk you through the results just because this graph is gonna get messy and so i'm gonna um slowly add up be adding the points the data points um so shown on the on the x-axis so the horizontal axis we have the laminar length index so how the relative spacing or the width the relative width of the the plate and cementum interval and so on the left side so woolies in this case they have this they're they're shorter and and i put the columbians here and we're gonna member followers that have these wider uh lamelas and then on the other axis we have the enamel thickness so that is thinner doors deep the bottom thicker towards the top so that yeah woolies tend to be on average have these thinner enamel and the column colombians have uh this thicker enamel so the dots here so that that's where the woolly specimens are from beringia and russia for brutally pleisoscene the dots uh for the columbia specimens are from the middle and early pleisocene and now if we plot the elite places in specimens that have been identified as colombia from the colorado and the rocky mountain areas this is where they follow the crosses um and then looking at this mammoth specimens from the midwest and the great lakes here they are the triangles so they overlap they basically spend the whole range and that makes sense because there's evidence that some of those is like the woolly morphology we have the columbine morphology and yeah it spawns the whole range in that geographic area and then here are a few specimens from the southwest the stars and mexico too and then the dashes are specimens from the southeast of the united states a lot of them are from florida so it is quite a messy graph as you can see there's quite a lot of overlap between the woolly morphology and the columbine morphology shown in the shaded area is the area of overlap between the northernmost specimens so the specimens from boringia and the southernmost specimens so industry specimens from the southwest and um and shown here these are the specimens from alberta for the upper third molars the last molars so it is interesting that we have um it spans quite a bit of the other range too but but for the operating we have this two separate clusters so we have some the cluster on the right we have specimens that have the columbia morphology and then the cluster and on the left we have specimens that have more of the woolly morphology so that's for the upper teeth um and then for the lower teeth once again so these are the dots are uh woolly specimens from boringia and parts of russia too then we have specimens from early and middle classes and from of columbia morphology then specimens from colorado and wyoming i think and then the southwest and great lakes area the southwest of the united states and mexico and the southeastern united states and once again that's the area of overlap between the northernmost specimens bombaringia and the southernmost in this case they're from the southeast from florida and here are the specimens from alberta so here unlike the operative we see a gradient that spans from the woolly morphology on one side to the columbine morphology on the right side and we have a couple of specimens that are following that area of overlap that that in our manuscript we're calling those specimens with intermediate morphologies but we're not really going to make any assumptions about the relationships because we really need independence independent data like dna data for example to try to make more sense about are those maybe hybrid specimens um per se like proper or or what are they like or are they yeah so so in this case uh we're just calling them intermediate um mammoths for intermediate morphologies anyway so those are the results for as far as how they plot and in in morphologically um i want to show you in terms of space so this is again from the neotoma database the dots that you see are from specimens that um we didn't look at well with the exception of i don't know if you can see my cards are the arrow here with the exception of the green dot in the southeast of the province that specimen is from it's a tooth it's a lower m3 uh but the other ones are not m3 specimens so um that's why we didn't look at those particular specimens the other the other the red triangles um and and and we feel we're actually we're unsure about the ideas of some of the specimens too that are on yotoma because the southernmost red triangle in alberta those are mammoth footprints from a site that is called wallace beach and they have been identified as woolly uh footprints but um just based on the fact that there's um there's a few specimens like the specimen from calgary that harrington and shackleton identified as a wooly it's a second molar but it hasn't really been dated so anyway those footprints um they could be they could be woolies or columbine i guess the size might tell you anyway but um okay i just want to plot here in this map uh the specimen is we looked at so shown here are the uh the woolly specimens uh in our sample so from some from the southeast of the province around the medicine hut area and other specimens from the edmonton area and then for the columbia specimens with columbia morphology here they are so we have again some from the southeast part of the province from the edmonton area and there is one specimen from the northwest part of the area close to grand prairie that town so at least morphologically we have some of the northernmost specimens that are known for the columbia morphology here in alberta there's also a northern one from british columbia from bc that that is plotted in the otoma but yeah so that that is quite interesting that that we see some of these morphologies going quite far north um i admit that we don't know a lot more about the north part of the province just because there's not a lot of we don't have a lot of specimens from that area part of that is because there's the boreal forest that covers a lot of that land also part of that is that because there's not it's not there's not a lot of people living over there that can come across fossils and um and also i guess we haven't really done a lot of field work out there too but um oh yeah and then the next one yeah those intermediate specimens are here from the inventory area that's the square the blue square are those intermediate specimens so so as far as their inch is concerned so we have there's been a few published radio carbon dates for some of the specimens we looked at i'll show you those here now unfortunate some of those are infinite so we have for the inventory area we have infinite dates for a woolly morphologist and infinite for columbine morphologies and one of the intermediates um has been dated to 43 300 plus or minus 3 000 years so it's quite a bit of that the standard deviation is quite big so it's quite large so which makes me think that maybe we should predict that specimen actually that specimen is actually that partial skeleton that i showed you before that's one of those intermediate morphologies based on the teeth of course looking at the tooth and then the other thing we have available at the time is for a specimen from the south east of the province it's actually this is a specimen that was um published by churchill in 1972 and then dated back by hills and harrington in 2003 and they came back as uh 10 130 years old oh yeah this festival also uh was included in the study by inc at all in uh 2016 so there's some dna data for that particular specimen yes and so yeah we definitely that's the next step uh for us too is to well try to get some funding to date more specimens um um and see how they're distributed distribution their patterns in in time uh right now with the data that we have at the very least we can say that um that uh during the post glacial so after the last glacial maximum which happened about like between i don't know 20 000 and 15 000 years ago or so uh during the post lgm um at least we can say that um mammoths with colombia morphology some populations came back to alberta as the ice was melting maybe some woolly uh specimens came back or animals but we don't have any directly aided specimen that's consistently identified as woolly but um but yeah so so there's um this is what we can see as far as uh as them coming back back to the province after the last glacial maximum although they didn't come back for long because at around 11 000 years ago a lot of these animals here in alberta and other parts of north america uh went extinct so they disappeared leaving behind the remains um this actually shown here in this slide is our footprints from that wallace beach site in the south part of the province and we've done some prison field work in that area over the last few years in collaboration with colleagues from archaeology here at the museum where we work chris jazz and the archaeological survey and members of the archaeological site of alberta and colleagues from the um what is the national history museum in in ottawa the canadian national history museum anyway but yeah i've seen those footprints uh in field and it's quite interesting because they're quite it's amazing to see to see them on site because you're immediately looking around to see if you can see them because some of them look so french yeah anyway so we still have to do more more work hopefully as as we continue to feel where we can we can find um more specimens at welles beach specifically we have footprints but we don't have bones so far of mammoths so so we're looking um and also hopefully as as the sun and gravel industry continues to work more specimens can can be found that we can also study and oh and the next step of course would be to try to look at the genetics of some of these specimens right now studies is solely morphological to kind of build a framework a better sense of like morphologically how are the um mama teeth that we looked at from alberta how are they distributed but of course the next step is to look at the genetics and see how well yeah what that tells us about about them and in the bigger picture of what was going on in north america christina what is what do we know right now about the genetic work on mammoths if you could tell the audience you know is it is it that we still think that there were two or three species or is it more toward the one species hypothesis that's prominent i don't know actually okay well the thing is that um there's evidence of that interbreeding between those colombian uh mammoths and willie mammons and um like we need to because i know i'm like um like um i mean it's a fine line about how do you define a species right like how much because even modern animals sometimes you have species that are interbreeding and some of those hybrids are are crossing back to their parent populations and you have that in admixture and introgression but uh but you don't have so that's how you have that gene flow going to the parent populations um but still the parent populations may maintain could maintain some degree of um separate identities and be called different species it's like it's all like a gradient as far as how much of that inter-breeding is going on between the two the two the two types of mammoths in this case and um and i don't know i i could say i could ask chris witka because that's what i'm saying i don't know how much um evidence of like um yeah what are your thoughts chris on this like i guess my question is like how much um is this interpreting like is it like what how did it happen a few times in the past or is it something that like was constantly happening in their area of overlap for example here in alberta nowadays we have um hybrid zones especially for birds for example and other animals too and and actually when we started doing this work uh because the genetic work had already been published uh chris and i were talking and tasha to we were talking about so what if all of our specimens are like intermediate and maybe alberta what was a hybrid zone for mammoths in the past and so that's that's one of the things we had in mind as we were looking at the morphology and um but um yeah so i i wouldn't yeah what are your thoughts chris you you uh i think we we would agree uh on a lot of things and i i think there's some scale issues too so with this this most recent paper uh with the million-year-old mammoth dna in liberia you know it kind of suggests that we do have this this hybrid speciation event sometime deep in the mammoth family tree where you have woolies and step mammoths maybe some unknown uh species of mammoths that that there is some sort of hybridization event that happens way deep in the past and then that turns into columbia mammoths eventually um but on the other hand you know when we have looked at kind of the the narrower scale where we're looking at uh you know contemporary mammoths in alberta that show different morphologies or overlapping morphologies um genetically at least in terms of the mitochondrial dna they aren't as distinct often um you know so so in that case we may have we we may be seeing a local population that is more variable uh because of closely related uh parent populations so yeah it's it's fun i know when we were writing up some of this stuff you know the co-authors would say well do we do we synonymize things uh and make them all woolly mammoths and you know as a morphologist i say well i i really don't want to do that um but there's also some some clear genetic patterns that you have to kind of account for as well so they're really fun to think about yeah this is a this is a uh a textbook case of pick your species definition in some ways that um uh until recently um because now that we can get dna for for all of these animals and even dna going back all to all the way back to like a million years old that's a recent development in the past the way we were defining species was through their morphology and the way that the mammoth species have been defined and the holotypes like the colon types of mammoth colombia it's it's their teeth and the morphological characters are the ones that are the diagnostic characters that define what mammoth colombia is so so we gotta make sense like we the genetics is telling us something but we need to um bridge that gap like we're we're probably the first generation that is encountering to this great definition of like how do we define the species because we can do it have a biogenetic species concept for example where we have the genetics and and look at the tree and decide okay at this point in the tree all of these populations are called columba or whatever we want to call them at this point in the dream um or we can also sorry yes well i don't mean to interrupt i mean at some level it also comes back to how we define those morphological species we're left with teeth for most of these specimens and you know is that because our characters just aren't just don't give us a particularly good resolution uh they are variable characters within these different populations and they show some overlap um you know alberta is this super highway for mammoths and in different populations of different things at different times and so you have this this potential for a a kind of glommed together paleontological record where you're conflating space and time and different biological populations and things like that they appear side by side so you know going back and getting lots of radio carbon dates and things like that and defining you know where those lines are where those chronological lines are where getting at potentially populations uh would be really fun so the really fun project that you guys are probably already doing that would be just to look at all the different morphological variations across the spectrum and then do dna on each and see how messed up all of that is because i can imagine that the morphology is not necessarily going to lump things into the more floated closer related clusters together and if that's the case it gives us this other sort of warning sign about our interpretations of morphology indicating closer relatedness christina i'm really excited that you're working on mammoths because you started with horses and which is even more difficult they're so messy and noisy that you know bringing that perspective to mammoths i i mean how do you how does that transition for you i mean is this kind of natural for you to to think about this sort of variability about oh it's like the battlefield well you know it is um well i guess but to be honest my first impression when i was like looking at the mammoth teeth is that um the characters that are used are quite there's very few characters but i think it's because of the nature of the record because as you mentioned a lot of um a lot of the ideas are based on the teeth and then and within the teeth there's really only three characters that are used that might be like relevant and that is the oh like as we can see four uh for the history of mammoths that's the height of the tooth hypsorantine then you have the number of enamel plates the spacing how packed these plates are and the enamel thickness so to be honest i was thinking like oh my god there's so few characters to actually like make sense of this especially because these characters are tied to feeding ecology they're all completely tied to demands on the dentition the bit from their diet so at the tooth height of course more abrasive abrasive either from the plants or from the environment there's a selective pressure of more abrasiveness happening in the teeth the addition of the enamel plates that's because you need to be more efficient at processing food low quality food that is tough vegetation you need to be able to process more of that in less amount of time you need to be more efficient at grinding that so to be honest i'm like those characters are i don't there's no way that the genetics and the morphology are gonna match just because of of the um the way that i see the the morphology of the teeth tells me the history of their selection that these animals have encounter selection for feeding um um challenges i guess challenges in in their diets now they're not i think we were talking a little bit about about this before we went on live because the way that i see is like some of those changes once you have them they're good to to process some top vegetation but you can also process maybe other plants what i'm trying to say is that maybe you you might be seeing something like dolo's law here the irreversibility of evolution so once you have evolved high ground teeth you cannot go back to low crown teeth as like to the same degree as you started even if you're eating even if you're browsing or i guess unless that's really damaging your condition yeah well it's a great animal to be studying sort of as a case study for sure and looking at the comparison of morphology and genetics and your reservation up there is is is quite extraordinary too isn't it the the level of the collagen preservation and the protein preservations yes oh yes i'm just going to mention because i want to bring back to those horses because in courses at least there's some there's a few more characters like um there's the metapodials that people have looked at there's um there's a dentition of course and you may have also the same issues with like selection on the dendition that that's like feeling the feeling ecology effect in their morphology but i think um i think it would be really good i mean we have to look at expand for mammoths expand um and and i know some researchers are looking at this to expand increase their morphological data set to from us in addition to the teeth um what are your thoughts on that chris like um i think that's a great idea uh but you know like you said it's you're you're limited by your preservation uh and and we teeth are common and you know sometimes it comes back to well can we think about these teeth in different ways uh i i think number one we it'd be nice to have some nuclear dna uh on on these things a lot of the the genetic work in north american mammoths and kind of looking at this columbia and wooly mammoth separation is done with mitochondrial dna so it'd be nice to kind of revisit some of these things uh with new techniques and and that can get at nuclear dna um but then you know there are there are things about mana teeth that we haven't necessarily figured out how to measure very well it's like they're hard yeah well i mean like for instance the enamel how much enamel volumetrically do we have in a tooth uh you know can is that something that would play out in space and time so you know there are there are fun things to think about yet with mammoths i think yeah you tried because i mentioned those four traits those are the uh four characteristics that people traditionally have looked at that the eclipse around the lamellar frequency or laminar length yeah the thickness um but um but yeah you're right there's other ways i guess it's an opportunity to be to be creative too and um figure out how else we can study study them what other morphological information there is that we can gain from it and and you're right maybe that the volume of enamel might be i think we better go to some questions from the audience david do you have one ready yeah we've got a few questions so a reminder for people uh if you haven't already leave a question in the comments and we'll see how many we can get through we've got a few already let's start with this one from aaron aaron says based on the tooth morphology between the two species can you tell how their feeding ecologies might have differed um based on their i i mean i can tell you that traditionally what people thought about what they were eating so like well for example woolly mammoths um they were proposed to have been i mean the more we learn about ecology and reconstruct their diets the more we realize that they're quite flexible a lot of these animals they're they're eating a variety of things like um i've done studies um dietary studies on horses and you see some mix feeding on horses in like uh places in horses uh from the yucatan for example where you had um yeah so so it's a sorry what was the question whether i can tell them like tell exactly the question was uh using the tooth morphology can you tell if there were differences in their feeding ecology um to some extent i guess you kind of enforce it but no actually i would have to but we have techniques for looking at like microwave amisoar isotopes those are way better indicators of whether or what the animal was actually eating a particular animal yeah there's been selection for for that morphology in the past but um that morphologies yeah like i said the more we find the more we realize that animals have some a lot of animals have this flexible dietary flexibility plasticity dietary plasticity yes okay uh another uh question on a similar line with a different method uh grant boardman has chimed in with as he puts it his requisite isotopic question grant always likes to ask his questions about isotopes this time he says do stable isotopes differentiate the ecology between the species if they differentiate when you say that they turn like bullies and columbine uh yes i assume that that's what yeah he's asking um actually no i don't know for that one i know there's a lot of isotope studies that have been done um i mean i'm trying to think uh from what i know as far as like well the animals the woolies that were living in brain child um are different from from what i know of those environments some those environments were sometimes extremely drying and um and i truly believe that they were they only had like grasses and forbs like really short low shrubs to to feed on so if you look at the ice stoves you would tell that difference between those populations living in the north and then populations living in mexico for example yeah so i i can jump in there a little bit too um so you know we're kind of dealing with an evolutionary time squat scale and an ecological time scale so tooth morphology is really evolving to address these long-term trends in diet whereas things like isotopes things like microwave they're really addressing the diet of that animal as it lived and so um you know places like alberto where these these this forage changes fairly rapidly and things like that that ecological time scale can change very rapidly and it takes a long time for the the evolutionary time scale to pick up uh and say ketchup so yeah this is these are these are fun kind of tensions within paleontology i think that that is one of the really enjoyable things about working with proboscians right can i add something you write about the the time scale aspect because um yeah the morphology uh it's something it's more evolutionary at that scale so it's with longer so you need to have that selecting pressure to cover uh the generations of animals yeah i know that in the traditional sense like in before traditionally mammoths were viewed as a this anti-genetic sequence or like chrono species where you have this trend of in some of those morphological characters uh do you think chris i'm asking a question now instead of answering questions because the way that i see it is that maybe the selection pressure was more episodic than what we think that although it was for a longer period of time than ecological time it wasn't like a constant selecting pressure to um in one direction for example yeah yeah i mean i'll give a short answer um i don't know uh there's there's so much biogeographic uh kind of variability going on that it's gonna be really difficult to sort that out and i don't know that we have the data right now or the chronological resolution to really address that at least in north america right yeah david uh yeah let's get into let's see if we can get in one or two more here uh speaking of the teeth and diet and such uh our friend ethan has asked does wear on the teeth seem to affect the function of the teeth up until senescence so i suppose as the teeth wear over the age of the animal does that change how they're functioning as a teeth where does that change how they function um you know i know there's a recent study that was published looking at um i can't think of the uh citation or or the first author i know that um klaus klaus from europe he's done a little work with like uh modern anglers and and and also provositians about their diets and in that study they looked at um modern like zoo animals of elephants and they realized that when there were when you had one two being replaced by the other one and you had those two teeth at the same time the body condition of the animal improved um as opposed to when there was only one single tooth in occlusion and so it suggested that you in their analysis they they see the cyclical pattern in body condition that when you have that overlapping those two teeth and they relate that to the area like how much um blades you have in on the surface area i guess the chewing surface area so that really does suggest that during the age of the animal an individual animal as a teeth wear their efficiency at processing food is not constant yeah those suggest that there's times when when they're more efficient at acquiring nutrients from the food and their body condition is better they do say the authors of the study do do say that they only see the strength in zoo animals where there's control conditions about what the animals are being fed uh because this difference might be some quite minut in the wild that or i may also get lost with because animals are using different plants so the relationship with the body condition may not be as straightforward as what they have seen with the zoo animals but i found that very very interesting too that to see how um yeah the relationship how they study the body condition of the elephant and the and related to the tooth replacement their sequence yeah we have one more from greg mcdonald and he is asking about schreier lines and one of you might know the answer to this and that's whether or not you see a difference in this in the tusks in the different species of mammoths oh i haven't we do have we chris and i have talked about looking at trigger lines because a lot of our tasks are fragmentary and they're not yeah they're not complete and we also want to well also we don't know if they're mastered on some of those tasks uh but we haven't yeah we haven't uh done that project so i don't know it might be another habit but chris you know it's like a study because i haven't read i know there's differences of course between mammoth and macedon yeah so i mean i'll i'll back up a little bit and uh and kind of talk a little bit about trigger lines so traeger lines are are these angles if you look at a cross section of a tusk um you know they're basically angles between some of the dental dentin features uh and mastodons and mammoths are distinguishable depending on what kind of angle you are looking at uh in that den i don't know that anybody has looked at it between different species of mammoths um i'm not aware of any uh since they're they're they're really reflecting kind of well at least we think that they're reflecting larger morphologies of the tusks themselves um if we are seeing very different test morphologies then we would expect to see differences in trigger lines um but yeah the in alberta might be a really fun place to look at that because you do have such diversity there so yeah please please follow up on that and publish that for the rest of us you have a lot of fragments which makes it kind of ideal exactly oh yeah yeah david and is there any other question are there any other questions uh we've got one more question here uh and then i think it'll be about time to wrap up grant says my wife is wondering what a hybrid would look like colombian with a wooly's poof of hair or perhaps a balder wooly um yeah how would that look like maybe maybe uh since of course that's very hard to know what would you want it to look like yeah i'm like um what would i want no i would want i would want a hybrid with like um like a little funky pattern of like four in some areas and then less for in other areas like a poodle maybe like a poodle all right we better wrap it up anything else david i think that's it thanks to everybody for joining us for asking questions as always yes thank you so much for being on the show christina we really enjoyed it yeah thank you so much for the invitation thanks i really i really enjoyed talking with you and learning more too because like i said my main topic is horses i'm just like sidetracking two moments yes for a little bit and then yeah i'll go back to questions sidetrack to mammoths i love it most of us get involved yeah all right thanks for tuning in everybody thank you again christina thank you thanks bye", "UI3z2KljRCs": "all right we're just coming back from the CV shop downtown LA just picked up half a gram of blue dream come on in at eighty five point four percent TC it's really good hi very very tasty something you guys want to go and pick up yeah a chance fresh batch 5:15 mm-hmm better local but tender and pick up your sneezies flacon I'm making another video we started making our last blue drink opening box opening that was three weeks ago and we have not recorded a video sentence cuz I've been picking up blue dreams every week it's actually so delicious I got the bloopers - I don't think I like the raspberry hint that they got in that one but I love this blueberry flavor there's something about it it's only 85 percent THC the string hits oh my god literally three weeks in a row I haven't changed to what I've been smoking so that's pretty crazy bit and a half - unfortunately if we want to keep making vids but man okay and they're all the same batch so tasty super super delicious super fresh I know I went yesterday things that work and they did have more blue drink they are kind of short on the stock right now because they're so fired people been hitting up so much they're they're running out all the good stuff we've been looking for that water on Z we had not hit it I want to get it for date for Father's Day back I don't know if they're gonna get it back they did have a watermelon seed pod that it's the yeah Viper essence those ones are really good but all right guys go pick up some seizing some bomb ceasing hit the blue dream even the comments if you try to if you like it what your thoughts are all right talk to you later", "c3wRCZPDypE": "[Music] come on guys let's go EMP continuing my video series for the Blue Room a 4000 watt blue Dreamgirl which is going to consist of 16 blue dream plants let's see I've got them all right here this is again going down eight plants around what I normally do to the via 24 plants so we're definitely cutting the numbers down significantly giving these plants a lot more space to fill out I've been really aggressive on topping these plants so you can see that the canopy is extremely even all these plants are really bushy multiple heads on all these plants you know the stalks are nice and thick already and the drip system in this room again is working awesome so the today is going to mark they wanna flower these plants have been sitting in just about exactly 48 hours just a little shy of that actually of darkness so you can see that the new growth is really light because they've been sitting in darkness for two days growing with no sunlight so it just got fed for the first time in two days with the beat one of bloom newts so they should Green right back up here the next day or so and they should really started to take off now I plan for this grow on the nutrients is to run a combination of the X nutrients and the psycho and what that's going to compile is the X nutrients full line which is going to be the grow bloom micro the amino blast and the bloom FX and and then I'm gonna be running pretty much all these of psychos additives so we're gonna be running the uptake thes I'm the doctor repair and the potash right now and I gonna run pretty much all of those except for the potash all the way through and then when we get to you know probably up the fifth week or so we'll probably switch over to these swell and see how this works compared to what I've done with blue gem in the past this would be like the third nutrient line that I'm running blues dream on so I think I should have a pretty good ability to gauge you know its its results and growth rates and stuff in comparison to what I've seen in the past I have to admit that I'm really looking forward to this grow having less plants in it I think in the end it'll work out to be less work around harvest time and it also gives me the ability to really have a lot of space to walk around and check out the veins and you know just really spend a lot more out close to personal time with the plants we'll have to see how this yield holds up holds up to when I run six points the light instead of four points the light but either way you know this thing's off to a good start and I'm really looking forward to you know the results of those things so I would say that from now on it's going to be cruise control just maintaining the the reservoir and the nutrients right now for the the first week or two up flower I'm gonna keep the ppm s for the co2 down to about 800 and I want to get past about that second week I'm just going to bump the PBMs up to probably about 13 14 hundred and that's pretty much the only modification I think I'm gonna have to make I'm not sure how much light adjustment I'm gonna have to do you can see there's still probably close to two feet between the the lights and the canopy right now and you know they do obviously stretch quite a bit but I don't know how dramatic it's going to be since I was really really aggressive on topping these plants they haven't been chopped in about a week so you can clear just now starting to recover and looking really awesome so we'll have to just see how this thing goes but I plan to just throw hopefully only one layer of trellis setting and here to support this canopy and I think that's all the only thing I'm pretty much gonna have to do so yeah I think that's pretty much it we will see you guys at the next video update what's going on guys let's go MD and here making the next video for the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow and again this is the you know room that we have now taken our numbers down to 16 plants in here although it might be hard to tell because these plants are just [ __ ] huge I mean you look at them from the side and yeah they're just extremely bushy lots of main notes on all these plants and I can just tell that you know the thickness of these stems means they're just going to be donkey dick colas and I am really really happy with the way that the canopy has just naturally filled in I really like the fact that I have less numbers in here because it was you know obviously a little bit easier to manage the pre veg you know I took a little bit less resources I would say with the blue dream strain in particular a didn't take really hinder my time by having to get these planes extra because these plants just grow really really fast anyway I would say that I really like the fact that I can walk around really easily in this screw you know the canopy is really maintained and due to the fact students the thickness of these stems and these stocks already I don't think I'm really gonna need to do much trellis netting here until we start getting into the budding weeks you know which should be happening over the next two you know they're starting basically after the end of next week it'll really start getting into the heavy budding at least at this strain so I think you know once I once I kind of start noticing that these you know coalesced are waving a little bit more than they do now in the wind then I'll probably throw up the trellis net and I think one layer should do it just the extensive amount of topping has really helped these plants just get really nice and sturdy so I think that with this strain particularly I will probably repeat this method only doing for plants perlite and I might even experiment trying this with a couple of my other strains but that's yet to be determined so yesterday the reservoir pretty much started to run out and I filled the reservoir up with fresh water gave them one quick feeding you know fresh water and then you know made them made up at new rez and what that basically compiled is for this run I don't know if I mentioned it on the percent but I'm going to be running the pull X nutrients line along with all of the psycho additives so what this week calls for is eleven hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 of the X micro and the it's amin oblast and and then on the psycho side we have 250 milliliters of potash 200 milliliters of uptake design and dr. repair we also added 250 milliliters of silica blast and 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's pretty much gonna do it for this week and the Blue Dream I know it can really take some pretty heavy feedings I'm not gonna really be topping off my reservoir right now I'm feeding them in line with what I I'm running on the green cracks right now and depending on how they look if they still look you know just as green and healthy and no burn and then everything as they do right now then I might up my PBMs from a little bit more than what it already calls for cuz it calls for a steady increase in the bloom for the first three weeks so I will probably do a little bit experimenting with that but as always I'll let you guys know what I end up throwing in the reservoir so this room is on cruise control the drip system has made all the difference in the world for me in terms of my management of these gardens the automation has made all of my room my firearms pretty much hands-free - filling up the reservoir which I'll have to do is turn this started hooked up to a flow valve and then I add the nutrients and then you know every other week I take that whole thing out clean it so but other than that you know the controller maintaining all my levels exactly where I need them I think I have my temp threshold set at about 80 to 83 degrees which is usually kicks a little bit lower than that it just runs a little bit harder because these sensors a little bit closer to the light but either way we're running the PPM's all the way up at 1350 right now yeah running with my 1350 just let them have it and I'll probably bump that up to about 1500 next week or so I'd say but controller keeping all my temperature humidity and everything in check and yeah that's basically it for now so not a whole lot going on in terms of development I can see they're just now getting ready to start you know popping out with pistols so I think by the next video we should have a little bit more interesting and interesting setup to look at and I have a 100% decided if I'm gonna go back in here and remove more of this undergrowth you know a lot of this stuff even though it's on the it's on the sides it's getting a lot of light but on some of them you know where it's interfacing it's not so I might pull these plants out of here and give them a nice you know lolli popping probably at the end of next week you know as usual when manigott I got through my second week of flower I typically come through one more time and clean them all up and just really try to get as much of the shrubbery and what would ultimately become those popcorn buds and those big major families that aren't gonna get any light and just kind of fall off anyway because we lacked nitrogen and that would really help you know promote all the growth upwards so that'll probably be the next step that'll probably be the net only change between now the next videos I'll pull this plants out one last time lollipop boom put them back in give them a little time to recover throw up a trellis net and it's rocky roll for the rest of the cycle it's not gonna be a problem and the thing that's really awesome about the drip system is that because I'm not using those emitters that actually puncture into the pot the tubing just kind of sits on it and then I have just one little small metal hook to just kind of hold the clip or the hold up to in place I can pull these plants out in here really easily and I don't have to [ __ ] with my drip system all that much or you know risk pulling the emitters out of the pots and pull it you know that can damage the root zone stuff too so this is kind of a hands hands off you know version of my drip system compared to what the roots I've had to deal with in the past so yeah so far so good guys we'll be we'll be back probably next week - next time alright guys what's going on back with the next video update here from 4000 watt room a which is the blue dream group featuring an ex and psycho nutrients together what I feel will be very very successful growth today we're getting the videos back on track putting today at 8:15 the first day of week three or the conclusion of week two however you want to look at it but we have three flowers and websites starting to come in not a whole lot of you know bras or anything really showing it to day 15 but you can definitely see that it's gonna be a nice full canopy he's got a lot of bad side strolling out looking really [ __ ] awesome really liking the way this room is looking at least with this particular string using for plants for light I think that the plains definitely respond better they spread out and allowed a lot more room for each of these colas and these buds is going to be massive I know last video I promised I would probably have the trellis netting up by now but I haven't really needed to do any are having needed to worry about the canopy moving at all because these stems on these colas was so thick you look at that compared to my thumb all the way here that's super thick so these blood sites are not really moving at all granted I do think that when they start to get real heavy we start having these big you know donkey dick colas here on the on these buds then I probably will need to build up a trellis net so I would imagine within the next week couldn't go much more than one or two more weeks max before they'll really really needed that so today is reservoir change day we ran out yesterday and I cleaned it out replaced it with a fresh one gave him one feeding of fresh water and today came in topped him off one more time and he went ahead and added the next few nutrients and what I did is put in twelve hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 milliliters of the X micro and the amino blast and then I also put in 275 milliliters boom effect so we're starting that here you know about the third week at the recommendation of X nutrients you know their test grower that's his recommendation so we're starting that and we're also now going to continue off with the rest of our cycle additives which when we stepped up the potash or this week started in three hundred milliliters of potash 250 milliliters of silica blast 500 milliliters of sweet raw and then 200 milliliters of uptake as I'm and doctor pair so like I said the full X line and every out of it from psycho with the actually I'm the only one I'm not using this b-1b that's because I don't have enough to run it all the way through so anyway but yeah you know so far everything is just looking outstanding of no complaints jerk system is working fantastic not having to do any top offs this new version with one inch has definitely made all of the difference in the world getting rid of all that quarter-inch all my plant sites are getting the exact amount of water that I want now and the plants are just really loving the consistency of the feedings and the quantities really healthy garden right now really happy I am writing this thing at 1350 ppm still right now will probably step the co2 up to 1500 or 1450 in the next week or so when they really really start heavy budding but for now we're just going to let them get finished with the rest of their stretch I have been kind of adjusting the lights they're out there about 18 inches I would say above above the canopy and we're just gonna kind of keep it at that height in relevance to the canopy from you know as they continue to finish off their stretch I don't imagine that from here on out they'll stretch a whole lot more since they are starting to kind of sit down and develop their bud sites pretty nice I think additionally stretch you know another few inches or so so yeah that's pretty much it for this video the next video should be relatively interesting with a lot more bud development and we will be back next week to update you on the progress so till next time guys what's going on guys back with the next video update here from the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow featuring 16 blue dream plants running X nutrients and psycho additives so yeah you guys might notice that the trail set is up now in the script in this video and I just want to talk about that for a second here because one thing that I've pretty much always tried to preach to people is don't be the don't be the you know stereotype and what [ __ ] needs to get done don't put it off just get it done and your gardens will thank you for it and that's always basically been my style throughout this grow though I was kind of hesitant on putting up the the net for a little bit because I wanted to make sure that they can are stretching this planet back here [ __ ] stretch this [ __ ] ton more than the rest of these and so I wasn't sure they were so much eat up or what and since these branches were so thick I mean the stems are just ridiculously think of the top agiza I was like ah there's the thing they're good worry about it and I was planning on putting it up this Sunday and I got down here and I'm I was trying to finish my drip system and Home Depot ran out of the parts and didn't get it done I was driving all over the place trying to get you know some stuff and I was like I'll be good I'll do it on Monday when I get in and I get in yesterday and [ __ ] basically this whole front of my garden just was like laying on the floor basically these branches guys I let these plans get so pushy they eventually just pulled everything down with suicide heavy it just was making a mess you know put up the trellis man basically went in here and did a full-on volleyball session [ __ ] in there and I didn't see now step out of here there's a huge pile of brought down some huge branches too but I also lost a couple of big branches and in the process as they they came to UM Kings so far over that they snapped office then basically it was karma kicking me in the ass because I put it off so don't push it off that's the only thing that today's lesson will the plaintiff still looking good they're starting to offer back the child's name gentlemen some of these branches are still a little stunned see this guy right here he was falling over probably laying on the ground for a little while he's all over her some like these right here are I'm hoping they'll recover and I'm hoping that the net it's a promise it should provide us support checking along I don't know if I mentioned it but today is day 23 of flowering you just starting the four feet the reservoirs just topped off I've been running him out of fresh water for the last two days in the next couple days now Christel production on already pretty happy with the budget looking just pissed off that I I know what keeps me making sure I do anyway you can see that something next few weeks this garden comes so I'm just going to hit him up with the next week in nutrients and the next day or two I'm just gonna kind of flush them out like I said that's gonna let see I think I step up 1375 of the S bloom a 25 of them you know accidentally and then we're going to with a psycho evidence which is dr. hare to millions for all of these doctor repair design of tea right now we're still running the - the potash is at 300 milliliters we're also running 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's 250 million silikal glass that's pretty much it for this video we'll be back at the next one you", "4fGShnMZCT0": "all right you

don't worry about it we will take care of everything and return your money so it is a great time to get a better night's sleep not just a better night's sleep it will change the way you act in your day-to-day life and let's face it we're in our beds even more that we always say you spend a quarter of your life or a third of your life in bed right it's more than that right now so it should be a good mattress and this should last you at least 10 years divide 600 for the king or the california king over the next 10 years it's pennies so i want to introduce you to linda davies she brings us northern knights here hi linda how are you i'm just going to go ahead and lay down on my new mattress well i have to tell you something i am wonderful and so excited the response today is amazing and to get a new mattress in your house from qvc from northern ice that's been here over 26 years and to kind of like put 2020 to bed as we like to say and start 2021 off new sleep eat move more what a great way to start a new year i love that you just said eat and drink because in a few minutes we're going to show you that this is water repellent and stain resistant so let's go through though when you when i see a price like this i think it's just a bare bones mattress but i need to dive into these features with you to show you everything you're getting for this price so first of all you're getting the zoned quantum edge spring unit and it gives you greater support and we've added to this particular one from last year's model the lumbar support then you've got the five zone serene convoluted foam that is up the updated version of memory foam and serene dissipates temperature and heat and it helps with pressure points it is just the star of the show then we added this live smart top fabric it's it's a high performance fabric which is stain resistant moisture resistant and you can just the water just beads up on it made in the usa i can't think of a time that is more important to be buying things that are made in the usa it meets peer-to-peer standards so you don't have to worry about phone that's not safe so that's very very important when you're comparison shopping make sure your phone is third appear standard manufacturer's 10-year warranty and you can use this parry on your existing box spring a platform bed which i'm sitting on or an adjustable bed frame so if you've got one of those lifestyle beds that go up and down get two twin extra longs and replace it maybe you've had that for 10 or 15 years or if you just have one base that goes up and down get the queen or the king and you've got that whole new feeling because this is upgraded right now 2020 technology well and it truly couldn't be easier you don't have to get a special box spring like you just said it works on any surface and it comes to you don't have to get a delivery date you don't have to have anyone coming into your house it comes in this box you set it up on your own and we're going to show you an adorable video of sean killinger one of our hosts here setting it up with her husband and her daughter how easy it is it's contactless delivery so that's like it'll just show up on your doorstep before just like any of your other qvc or other delivery boxes do you bring it inside and you put it up on your own terms you don't have to wait for anyone or have anyone come into your house so let's look at that video right now too because i do want to show you how easy it is do you have it no no nice so it's a burrito good job honey thanks i go to the gym every day just so i can do this watch yourself honey can we cut open okay i think there you go there you go there oh yeah oh cool [Applause] look at it wow that's pretty cool go go go go go go i got it [Music] how's that check try it out see what you think that's exactly what i'm gonna do in about a week when i get mine that i just ordered i cannot wait jagger that's her daughter was so cute listen to her squealing and giggling because it is you're going to feel that way too because when you pop it open it like it it just like blooms into life it's that easy and that fun and you're sleeping on it that night i know some of them linda you have to wait a little while to like a day or two to sleep on them this one exactly with ours you only have to wait three hours and when you do open you'll hear a big swoosh and all the air comes out and it is it is that exciting as jagger was and sean was is that fun to do because you can't believe you're getting something like this that's condensed down by a 1200 weight and then shrink wrap sent to your home and it's going to be the mattress like you and i are sitting on right now now let's talk about what hybrid means and why everybody wants a hybrid mattress well a hybrid basically is a combination of what you're talking about you've got the coils and the phones so what you're looking at right now is you're pushing on that one i foam that's what everything rests on so the next thing you're going to put on top is that the quantum coil so that is the first stage of a hybrid right so you've got the coils and the navy blue ones are smaller denser and they are a little bit stronger spring unit and what that does is it makes it so you don't roll off the edge and you can sit on the edge of the bed like i am and like you are and you're not rolling off then through the middle of this particular one we have lumbar support so the central portion of this bed has lumbar support which we've strategically placed so you're going to have that comfort level this helps with supporting you and it gives uh we call it medium firm so this gives that firmness next layer here is the transition layer that's going to go on top of the quantum coil because what's this on top of this is the next new feature which is serene and it is a five zone combat diluted layer and as you just feel that terry pushing push as hard as you can down because the harder you push see how fast it recovers um memory foam of yesterday you would push down on it it would take a little time to recover not with this and all of the high and lows on this that's going to help with relieving pressure points which is so important because that's why you're tossing and burning at night when you go to sleep and then the next layer on top of this we've got a one inch gel that is encased in this top piece here so when you lay back on that when you lay back you have that aha moment it feels so good that's because that one inch gel and then that top layer is the new lift part so what the fabric is a high performance and it's water resistant and stain resistant so probably if you've got a 10 or 15 year old mattress right now and you took off the sheets and the mattress pad you might see some steaming to it the beauty of this is you'll be able to clean that mess up right away and you won't have any stains which i love so i'm going to show you that in just a minute with some blue liquid i'm so excited but first i need to let you know what's going on in terms of value so when you see everything that we're talking about and you know that this is our number one best-selling customer favorite material or mattress excuse me at qvc for all of 2020 and you look at those prices that's when you decide all right today is the day my mattress is old it's more than 10 years old it has stains on it i wake up throughout the night because i'm not comforted i am not supported my my joints are aching i need a new mattress well today you're not going to have to spend thousands of dollars look at the price of the king california king thirteen hundred dollars that is the comparative retail value that is what you would expect to pay for this quality but because it's our brand here at qvc we built it for you and we're giving you a phenomenal value but you cannot wait on that california king if you need it you need to place your order now we have 150 remaining you are saving 703 on that king or california king you are saving 530 on the queen which is always very popular if you need if you have the adjustable bed that twin xl you're going to need two of those because it's split um those that when you're saving 453 on each one maybe you have a kid that's going to go back to school next year to go to a dorm it can stay in the box in your garage and then you're ready to go but here's the best part because this isn't very normal that you get on a mattress but think about what happens when you because we eat drink live in our beds right now especially if you have kids or pets this is what's really important look at that these are completely stained and water resistant boom that blue liquid is gone that was great terry because what you're doing is you're just blotting we don't want you to rub we just want you to blot it up so think about it an accident happens in the middle of the night right um you may not be able to get to it right away so you take the sheet off you're able to block where it is and then just put new sheets on and kerry if you touch it you're going to say it's not even wet so i love that if you've got small children they come in the middle of the night and say i've had an accident you're able to go rip the sheet off clean it off and then put them right back to bed it's beautiful or and and you're talking about pets kids anybody that comes to visit um how about red wine filling i mean we all probably i know i can raise my hand i might be having a glass of red wine in the bed when i'm watching tv at night coffee in the morning and we're not just sleeping in our beds anymore i mean i've done a couple zoom calls for my bed this year i have two and you know what kids are at home now and so i have four children i can't imagine how i would space them all out with all the zoom teaching they're getting so we're in our beds a little bit more so why not start the year off with a brand new mattress um you're gonna get it before christmas and just enjoy it and let's see how easy it is to open it that's one of my favorite parts about this no making a delivery appointment you just open it up this is a previous airing um of you linda and jennifer coffee so go ahead this is so nice so you're taking the tool that comes with it you're taking all the plastic off we have a lot of people have asked does it have an odor to it not none whatsoever people have asked can i flip this mattress no you always want the white side up but you can rotate it if you want to um the beauty of this is it comes in a box 789 coils in a queen size alone the comfort factor is wonderful you can see that's almost 9 inches right now but it's going to be 12 and a half inches in three hours you can put your sheets on and go right to bed and there is no weight limit on this i know people have asked is there a weight limit none whatsoever so you're gonna get this home set it all up go to bed that night i can't think of any better holiday gift to give to yourself or", "jdg2qi_r25s": "[Music] you dreamed of the color blue dreaming of the color blue can be interpreted in a variety of ways quite often colors are simply interpreted as an

\"Secrets and Surprises\nof the Google Geo APIs\". My name is Ossama Alami.\nI'm a developer advocate on our Geo Developer\nRelations team, and I'm here today\npresenting with Aaron Jacobs, who is a software engineer\non the Maps API team. So what do I mean\nwhen I say \"Secrets and Surprises\nof the Google Geo APIs\"? Well, what I want to do-- what we want to do in\ntoday's session is give you, firstly, an overview\nof your options as a developer when you think about\nGeo, Spatial, and Geospatial APIs\nat Google, and then go into some specific\nfeatures of the Maps API, the Earth API, Fusion Tables,\nour web services, and the Static Maps API,\nto highlight some features that you may not know about,\nsome features that you may have seen\nbut don't know how to use, and give you an idea\nof what's new, and some exciting features. So we'll start\nwith the overview. When you think of Geo at Google,\npeople typically think of the Maps API Version 3,\nor the Maps API, the JavaScript\nMaps API. Our JavaScript Maps APIs are now\nactive on over 600,000 sites, and it is our primary\nmapping API, and what you typically think of\nwhen you think of Maps at Google as a developer. But we have more\nthan just these, what I'll call user-facing APIs,\nthese mapping APIs. There's the Earth API,\nwhich we'll talk about today. This lets you embed Google Earth\nand a web page and has a JavaScript API\nyou can work with. There's a Maps API for Flash, for any action script developers\nin the audience. We have a Static Maps API, which\nwe'll also talk about today. And then for Android\nand IOS devices, we have a native SDK,\nthat you can use for mapping if you're building\na native application. But there's more than just\nthese user-facing APIs. There's a suite of\ndeveloper tools, supporting APIs within\nGeospatial at Google, that support you as a developer\nin building these applications. There's our web services,\nFusion Tables, both of which we'll talk about,\nKML, which is an open standard for representing\ngeospatial data, SketchUp, which is a tool\nfor 3D modeling, and you can then\ntake those models and put it on Google Earth, and then Earth and Earth Pro\nthemselves, which are client applications\nthat you can use to visualize your data as well as work with\ncertain data formats. But there's more to it. Google has over 100 different\nAPIs and developer products, and lots of them that you may\nnot immediately think of actually have\na notion of place, a notion of location or some\ngeospatial aspect to them. You can get a user's location\nusing the Latitude API, geotag imagery using\nPanoramio and Picasa, or geotag videos\nwith YouTube API, updates using the Buzz API, and then there's some\ndeveloper tools, if you are an organization\nor a developer that has lots of geospatial\ndata, you know, satellite images yourself,\nyou can use Earth Builder and Earth Enterprise to work\nwith and visualize that data, and then tools like\nRefine and BigQuery, that don't necessarily have a\nspecific geospatial application, sorry, a specific\ngeospatial feature-- but they are tools\nthat you can use to work with geospatial data sets,\nand then query them, or refine that. So that's sort of a very quick,\nbroad overview of what is available\nto you as a developer when you think of\nGeospatial at Google. And we'll go right now into\nsome really exciting features of Maps API Version 3-- again, some features\nyou may not know about and some features\nthat are brand-new. First, I'll start with\nan overview of the Maps API. We released Maps API Version 3\nat last year's I/O, out of labs. Now if you're--\nand we deprecated Version 2. Now if you have\nan active Version 2 site, I don't want you to worry. We have a 3-year\ndeprecation policy. But I hope some of the things\nyou see today encourages you to switch to Version 3, because that's where\nour active development is, and that's where all of our\nnew features are built upon. The advantage of Version 3\nis also that it was built from the ground up to be\nboth a desktop and a mobile web-mapping API. So in addition to support\nand the mobile browsers for Android and Safari, we also\nsupport Blackberry 6 devices, and the Samsung Bada browser, and then the standard desktop\nbrowser support as well. You'll notice IE 6\nisn't listed here. While we--while the maps--\nthank you. While the Maps API will work\nin IE 6 and will not break, there are certain features\nthat will-- they'll degrade well, but they\nwon't be available to IE 6. But you can rest assured that\nyour map will continue to work and function with\nInternet Explorer 6. I said \"loads of features\".\nHere are just some of them. The things in blue\nare some of the things that we're going\nto talk about today. As you can see, there's more to\nit than just a map and markers. You can do so much more\nwith the Maps API. And the first thing\nI want to talk about is 45-degree imagery. So this 45-degree imagery,\nyou'll notice I'm looking at an angle,\nan oblique angle. If I zoom out--\nthis, by the way, is Google's headquarters\nin Mountain View, California, which is about 40 miles\nsouth of us here-- if I zoom out, I have the\nstandard satellite imagery. Now, I have the smooth\ntransition as a user when I zoom in to switch\nto a 45-degree imagery, and right now I'm looking north,\nwhich we'll call 40-- which we'll call, sorry,\nzero degrees. I can look east at 90 degrees,\n180, 270, and back to zero. And this is really\nhigh-resolution imagery, so you can see as I zoom in,\nyou get a lot-- a lot of detail, more than\nwhat you would get with just satellite maps. And as a user, I can turn off\n45-degree imagery, or go back and add labels. We have an ever-increasing\nlist of cities that's available worldwide. So I was gonna show you\nSanta Cruz, which is just further south\nof us here, and we also have\nVenice, Italy, as well as a large,\never-increasing amount of cities available globally. And so what's the code\nlook like to enable this 45-degree\nimagery? It's not enabled by default\nfor the Maps API, but it's really, really simple,\nand this will be a common theme in this presentation. The code to enable\nthese features is actually really, really\nsimple, really easy. Only a couple lines of code,\nand you can have a world of new possibilities and\nfeatures in the Maps API. So I simply set the map to--\nset, on the map, call \"set tilt,\" pass in \"45\"\nfor 45 degrees, and this enables\n45-degree imagery, so when a user zooms in\nat an appropriate zoom level, it'll naturally switch\nto that 45-degree imagery. And then to reset it, if I want to disable\nsatellite imagery, I just call\n\"map.set tilt to 0.\" And if I want\nto programmatically set the heading, I just call \"map.set heading,\"\nand pass in one of those-- one of those degrees. Another feature that is\nunrelated to 45-degree imagery, but I do like to demo\nwith 45-degree imagery, because it really gives you\nan idea of the surrounding area, is this overview map control. So this, I can move the box\neither in here, or as I pan, the overview map\ncontrol will update, and if I go back to map,\nit'll switch to map. This gives me\na higher perspective, a zoomed out perspective\nof where I am looking at, so the user can really\nunderstand the location, and this will collapse\nor expand. So the code to this is, again,\nvery, very simple. When I create a map,\nI pass in \"map options.\" If I want the overview map\ncontrol, I just pass in\n\"overview map control true,\" and if I want it open\nby default, I pass in an overview\nmap control option, and I say \"opened equals true.\" A new feature in the Maps API\nwhich I really like is marker animations. We have two animations\nthat we support. You can see those markers\ndropping. There's the drop animation,\nand there's-- as I move this marker, we have\ndraggable markers as well. You can see the marker drops\nand animates. This makes it a little bit more\nof an interactive experience for the user, feel like they're\nactually performing an action, and confirmation\nthat it worked, because they see\nthe animation. And then we also\nhave the ability to make all the markers\nbounce. I really urge you to use\nthis feature with caution, because a little bit\nis fun. Too much is a little\nannoying. We'll leave\nthose bouncing. When I create a marker, if I\nwant to pass in an animation, or if I want to animate it,\nduring creation of the marker, I just pass in the animation\noption here and I set the animation\nthat I want. In this case, \"drop.\" The other animation we support\nis \"bounce.\" If I've already created a marker\nand I want to set an animation, I just call marker-- on the marker I call\n\"set animation\" and I pass in the animation\nthat I want. And then if I want to clear\nthe animation, just call \"set null\"--\nsorry, \"set animation,\" \"pass,\" and \"null.\" So there's been lots and lots\nof improvements to markers in Version 3 of the Maps API\nvery recently, including many speed\nimprovements. If you want to learn more\nabout this stuff, you should go to the session\nentitled \"Speedy Maps\" which is 10:45 A.M. tomorrow. Layers is another feature\nof the Maps API that you may not know about. This enables you to very easily\nadd additional data on top of the map. We support various types\nof layers. The first UM I'm going to demo--\nGeo RSS-- let's you consume a Geo RSS file\nor a service and then easily display\nthat on the map. In this case, we're hitting\nthe Flickr API to get geotagged imagery\nof our tech writer's dog across North America. And then the other way\nthat you can get your data on top of it,\non top of the map very easily is to use KML. And in this example, I'm just loading KML\nfor transit lines in Chicago. So the other examples here\nare more using Google's data and showing that\non top of the map. In this case, I'm showing\ntraffic in Chicago. Every time I practice this, this highway\nhas always been red, so I don't know\nwhat's going on there. And then, bicycling--\nthis changes the view of the map and then highlights\nbicycling routes, roads that are known\nto be good for biking, and roads with bike paths. You can see, as a bicyclist,\nI can get a really good idea of what's easy to bike through\nin Chicago. And then, Panoramio-- I talked about Panoramio\nbriefly earlier. Panoramio\nis an image-hosting site that has exclusively\ngeotagged imagery, and we've added\na Panoramio layer, and it's more than just\npulling in imagery. You can see here,\nI get a good idea of user-contributed images\nof Chicago, but I can also filter\nby either a specific user-- so if you have\na Panoramio account and only want to show\nyour photos on the map, that's very easy to do--\nor I can filter by a tag. So here I'll search for\nWrigley, and you see, the stadium shows up here\nand there are various images that I can pull up. And then down south, there's actually a Wrigley\nBuilding in Chicago as well, and that's coming up. So all these layers work\npretty similarly. It's very easy\nto instantiate them for both KML and RSS. I use the google.maps\nKML layer. It understands both formats, and I pass in the path\nto that file or that service that's returning either\nKML or Geo RSS. Traffic layer and bike layer\nand Panoramio layer, I just instantiate it. And then,\nfor the Panoramio layer, if I want to filter by user\nor by tag, I just call\n\"Panoramio layer.set tag\" or \".set user ID\"\nto filter by those. And then in all cases,\nto add it to the map, I just call the set map\nproperty of the layer, and I pass in the map\nthat I want it to appear on. If I want to remove it\nfrom the map, I just call \"set map, null.\"\nI talked briefly about KML. If you want to learn how\nto create highly performant KML for both consumption\nin the Google Maps API and Google Earth,\nyou should go to the session titled \"High Performance KML\nfor Maps and Earth\" which is this afternoon\nat 3:45. Draggable directions\nis one of my favorite features. It was a highly requested\nfeature for the Maps API, because people saw this\non maps.google.com. They saw that they could\ndrag directions, and now whenever\nthey see directions, they want to drag it, right? The user sometimes\nknows a better path to get to a location. Here, I'm mapping from Moscone\nto our headquarters in Mountain View, and you know,\nmaybe I know that 101 is really terrible\nthis time of day, and I'd rather take 280. I can very quickly click\nand drag that over, and it'll update\nthe textual directions on the right automatically. Another feature that\nyou may not know about is these text directions actually\nlink up directly to the map, so as I click, a user\ncan see that individual turn. Draggable directions, again\nvery easy to add to a map. This example shows you how to\nadd directions to a map. The things I want\nto highlight are the top, these renderer options. I'm setting draggable to true,\nand I'm passing this into a directions\nrenderer. Directions renderer\nis the object that manages rendering\nthe directions, both in textual format\nand on top of the map. Now, since the user has\nan ability to drag directions, you as a developer\nmay want to know when they've interacted\nwith that and when the directions\nhave changed. You just need to listen\nto directions changed event, which we now expose. And then you can perform\nsome action. Street View is another\nvery, very popular feature. We have a huge Street View\ncoverage around the globe, and when we implemented\nVersion 3 of the Maps API, we wanted to implement it\nin such a way that it was usable\non all mobile devices. So we can't rely on Flash\nbeing installed, for example. So Street View in V3\nof the Maps API is implemented purely in HTML\nand JavaScript, and this gives us the ability\nto support you as the developer adding overlays on top of\nthe Street View, so markers and info windows, as well as completely\ncustom Street View, which is a really exciting\nfeature that I'll demo. And then, we've also exposed\nthe Street View service, the data service,\nwhich lets you query us to find out where Street View\nimagery is available and some other data about\nthat Street View imagery. Here's an example\nof overlays. In this case, these overlays\nare just markers. I have just a cafe,\nand a bank, and here I'm programmatically\ngoing to switch to Street View using this button. And you can see,\nthe marker shows up here, and so does the info window\non top of the Street View. Meanwhile, I'm panning,\nand everything updates. As I move down the street, you can see\nthere's another marker here that gets larger\nas I get closer. Naturally, it's a Starbucks. And that works fine as well. So this gives you more options\nwhen you're working with Street View in displaying\ndata on top of it. Another feature I'm going\nto demo is custom Street View. Here we have Street View\nimagery-- our Google Street View imagery--\noutside of our Sydney office. There's a bunch of buses\nparked in front because it's across the street\nfrom a casino. As I move down the street,\nyou can see this is the standard\nStreet View imagery. If I move up the street,\nI've added a link, for this demo,\nto the Google Sydney office. This is not part\nof our Street View imagery that we provide to you, but something that you can do\nas a developer. And here, I've taken a panoramic\nimage of the interior of the Sydney office, the lobby,\nand I can view this, and then, again, link back\nout into the street. It's a great way to do\nindoor mapping, and so that the imagery\nfor Street View doesn't end on the street, but rather\ntakes you into a building. If you want to learn how to\ndo this, you should go to the \"Map Your Business\nInside and Out\" session, which is at 1:45 P.M.\ntomorrow. So I said V3,\nwe optimized it for mobile. We are also very concerned\nabout keeping speed up and latency down. So when we wanted to add\nfeatures to the Maps API, we didn't want to bulk up\nthe JavaScript that the user has to download and then\nthe browser has to parse, but we wanted to add some new\nand exciting features and keep the load time down. So we've introduced this concept\ncalled libraries. And using a library\nis very simple. When you load the Maps API,\nthere's just a script tag to load the Maps API. I specify a libraries\nparameter. I pass in a comma-separated\nlist of libraries. In this example,\nyou see Panoramio, which I demoed earlier,\nis actually a library that I loaded for that demo. And here I have Geometry,\nAdSense and Places, which I'll demo right now. Geometry is a library\nthat lets you compute angles, distances, and areas\nfrom latitudes and longitudes. So if you want to do\nsome spherical geometry queries, you can use it--\nload this library and use it. And it also comes\nwith an encoding library that lets you encode a path, so encode an array\nof latitudes and longitudes into a string representation\nof that, as well as decode that back\ninto latitudes and longitudes. AdSense. I imagine most of you\nare familiar with AdSense, yeah? Okay. AdSense is a way for you,\nas a developer or a publisher, to monetize your site by placing\nrelevant ads on your site, and then there's\na revenue-sharing model. What we found was that a lot\nof web pages have just a map, or a map is the core component\nof it. That's what the user\nis interacting with. And AdSense only displays\nrelevant ads based on the context, the\ntextual content of your website. So it wasn't getting\nthe relevancy of where the user was looking at\nto display relevant ads. Well, we fixed that\nwith the AdSense library for the Maps API Version 3. This is a library that\nyou can use to monetize, now, your mapping application. And it takes what the user\nis looking at and serves relevant ads\nfor that. So if a user is looking\nin wine country, north of us in San Francisco,\nthey'll likely see ads about hotels, or winery tours,\nor things like that. So it becomes much more\nrelevant ads that a user is likely\nto click on. It's very easy to add this\nto your map as well. All you do is create arbitrary\ndiv for the Ad Sense ad to live in, pass in the format\nof the ad, which is a standard AdSense\nformat, and then if you want the ad\nto live on top of the map, you can pass in a control\nposition for the ad, but the ad can also\nlive off the map and still be tied to\nthe context of the map-- your publisher ID, so we know\nwhere to send the checks, the map that it's tied to, and then whether\nit's visible by default. And then I just create the ad\nunit \"new google.maps.adsense,\" add unit, pass in the div\nthat it's living on, and the ad unit options\nthat I just described. And this is what\nit looks like. This is an example of an ad\nshowing up on top of the map. Here you can see,\nI'm looking in Monterey, which is south of us,\nanother tourist destination, has a famous golf course nearby,\nso I'm seeing ads for hotels and a golf course. Oh, man. Okay. So you can see,\nI'm moving. This moves to the bottom left. Let's see if this works. Sorry about this, guys.\nThis moves to the right. Apparently if I use\na drop-down box three times, it'll fix itself. [indistinct chatter] [laughs] So very, very easy to--\nso that sort of shows you where it can live on the map\nand then the format will change, the actual format of the ad-- I'm not going to click\non that right now-- to either--any of the standard\nAdSense formats. So you know, one\nof them is a long bar, one of them\nis a bigger box, one of them\nis a smaller box, et cetera. And then Places--\nPlaces we announced that we launched\nout of developer preview in the session\nearlier today. There's also a Places library\nthat you can load for the Maps API Version 3. It supports two services:\nauto-complete, which, if you're familiar\nwith maps.google.com, when you start typing, you see\na list of possible results, auto-completion of addresses or auto-completion of\nbusiness locations. We're giving you the ability\nto have that same feature on your sites, using the auto-complete\nfunctionality and Places. And then we have\na Places search service, which given a bounting box\nor a latitude and longitude and a radius, will let you search for\nlocal business listings and points of interest. If you want to learn more\nabout how to use Places, including the web services\nwe're launching with Places, you should go to the\n\"Location-Based Development Using Google APIs\" session, 3:00 P.M. tomorrow. And so I talked\nabout libraries, but what we also make available\nare utility libraries. These aren't loaded through the\nlibraries tag in the Maps API, but are instead open-source\nutilities that you can download, modify, and then use\nin conjunction with your map. They are developed\nby the Maps API team, and we do actively develop them\nand support them. You'll find utilities\nthat do clustering, that do custom markers\nand info windows, that do root boxing, and then a\nvery highly requested feature, Google Earth integration, we recently released as\nan open source library. So you can download\nthis library and get the Earth button\non Maps. You know, it's Map,\nSatellites, Earth, and it'll transfer all the items\nthat you have on your map to the Earth instance\nand sync the two. So a user can now view the map--\nview your content using Earth as well-- which leads me into discussion\nabout the Earth API. Again, the Earth API is a way\nfor you to embed Earth in a web page, and it has\na JavaScript API around it, so that you can define\nthe user experience and what content\nis displayed on top of it. It does require a browser\nplug-in, the Earth plug-in, which has support on\nboth Windows and Mac. And what does this\nlook like? There we go.\nSo here's Google Earth. I can turn on borders. There are various options\nfor what I can do. I programmatically\nset a button that just jumps to\nSan Francisco. I can pan down here\nand turn on or off terrain. One of my favorite features\nis the buildings layer. This gives you\na really good idea of what a city looks like\nin 3D as opposed to a top-down view\nof a map. Excuse me. And as this loads, you'll see more and more detail\nwill come in, in San Francisco\nand the Bay Bridge. And then, we recently\nadded trees to Google Earth. We have over 80 million\ntrees mapped. We get this data from\na variety of sources. A lot of it is actually\nfrom satellite imagery now, so it's where we pick up trees and add the specific type\nof tree to that location. Let's see. Here we have trees,\nand if you don't believe me, we have also enabled\nStreet View. If I click and drag this here, there are all the trees. Another thing I'll show you\nin Street View-- we'll jump to Moscone here-- is, as opposed to Street View on Google Maps\nand the Maps API, Street View in Earth\nis actually continuous. It does interpolation of\nthe imagery, between panoramas, and so it's a much more\nfluid experience going up and down\nthe streets. So that's a very cool feature,\nonly available in Google Earth. I must say though, my favorite\nfeature in Google Earth is historical imagery. This gives you access\nto Google's historical imagery, satellite imagery. Google is a relatively\nyoung company. We've been around\nfor about a decade, and Keyhole, the company\nthat was acquired, that then built Google Earth,\nis even younger than that, but we've been actively\nacquiring historical imagery and adding it to Google Earth, which you can access\nthrough the API. This enables you to build\nreally new types of applications that deal with history\nand the context of a place. Here I'll show you. I'll enable\nhistorical imagery. I've got a slider--\nwhich as a developer, you can show or not show. And then, I can disable it,\nre-enable it, and I'll jump to\nSan Francisco in 1988 to show you a cool demo\nthat I like to show. So there was an earthquake\nin San Francisco in 1989 that collapsed\nthis freeway here that led sort of through\nthe heart of the city. I'll show you.\nThis is the city. So we can actually\nsee that. This is prior\nto the earthquake, and if I move the historical\nimagery forward to 1993, you can see\nthat the earthquake-- or, sorry, the highway\ncollapsed, and then\nthey took down the freeway. But there's still a freeway\nhere, and as I move forward, you can see that they actually\ntore down that entire freeway and built\nthis ground-level promenade. And then,\njumping to the current time, you can see\nthat they've added trees and it actually looks\nquite pretty. But what I love to show\nabout this demo is that, even 20 years later,\nthere is a scar that runs through the city. Where the freeway used to be\nis now all parking lots. In fact, this is the only new\nbuilding that's been developed, and if I jump back to 2008, you can see it's a parking lot\nas well. So 20 years later,\nafter the earthquake, there is still a visible scar\nthat you can see through the city,\nthat you can now-- you can tell these stories using our historical imagery\nin the Earth API. And then I want to talk\nabout Fusion Tables. Fusion Tables is basically\na tool for storing, collaborating, and sharing\nlarge amounts of data. You can think of it\nas a cloud-based database, with tight integration\nwith the Maps API, spatial query support, and a sequel-like\nquery syntax and API. The best way to show\nyou Fusion Tables is to actually do\na quick demo. So here I have Fusion Tables. I have a list of tables\nthat I own, and I'm going to show you\ntwo examples. First is this table of roughly\n2,000 Brazilian beaches. I have the name of the beach,\nlatitude, and longitude. One of the most difficult--\none of the most common questions I get is, you know,\n\"I have 10,000 points \"that I want to show\non the map. What's an easy way\nto do this?\" Well, creating an individual\nmarker for those points gets quite cumbersome\nand very slow, can be very slow\nin a browser. So Fusion Tables supports\na very easy way to visualize this data. I can just click\n\"visualize map,\" and you see, it's rendered out\nall these 2,000 markers on top of 256-pixel\nsquare tiles, which is the same tiling scheme\nthat the Maps API uses, so it's a transparent tile\nwith just the markers, and then through JavaScript,\nit does the hit testing to determine where a marker is\nand then pull that data through. So this is a very quick map. There is no lag. I very quickly added\nthese 2,000 points. And then if I want to display\na heat map, I just click a check box. Now, it's very easy\nto display a heat map. A heat map is,\nin case you don't know, not a map of temperature. It is a map of density. So there is a high density\nof beaches located down here, and it's not quite as dense\nwith beaches over here. And then the other demo\nI'll show you is this. So I downloaded a CSV from\nthe American Community Survey, which is this government\norganization that puts out demographic data\nevery year. So it's broken down by\ncongressional districts, and it has some\ndemographic data, like what's the median age\nof this congressional district. And then, using Fusion Tables,\nI merged this CSV. I uploaded the CSV\nto a fusion table, and then I merged\nthat fusion table with a fusion table of all the\nU.S. Congressional districts, the shapes of the U.S.\ncongressional districts, which I found on\nFusion Tables. We have a set of public tables\nthat you can download from, and you can make your data\npublic as well. So you can see, you know,\nhere is a shape of-- or various shapes of the first\nAlaskan Congressional district. Maybe there's only one. There's only one. And I can visualize this\non a map, so it supports\nmore than just points. It supports polylines\nand polygons. This is not a particularly\ninteresting map, because, you know, I can click on this\nand I get all the data, but it doesn't really tell me\nanything. I can very quickly click\non configure styles. Let's say I want to color\nthis map based on the median age\nof the population-- let's say from green to red and 25-50. And you see now\nI get a thematic map, a map that I can\nvery quickly look at and see which Congressional\ndistricts trend older and which Congressional\ndistricts trend younger. And then if you're done,\nif this is all you want to show, I can actually just get\nan embeddable link here, copy and paste into my web page,\nand I get a map. But there's more. I mentioned tight integration\nwith Fusion Tables in the Maps API Version 3. Well, that's exposed through\nanother layer called the Fusion Tables\nlayer. You can see\nthis is a Maps API site, not an embedded I-frame\nfrom Fusion Tables. It is in fact styled, which is a feature Aaron\nwill talk about in a little bit, and here I'm displaying\nthe Brazilian beaches on top of my Maps API site, so I can just define\nthe experience however I want. And I can enable heat map\nthrough the Maps API. Maybe I need to click this\ntwo more times. Yay, that worked. And so I'm also\ngoing to show you the Congressional districts maps\nthat I just made. And it supports arbitrary\nqueries, so here, I'm selecting the shape of\nthe congressional district from my table ID,\nwhere the median age of the total population\nis over 30, but I can very quickly\nswitch this to 40, and very quickly\nI get dynamic results back, so you can build really lots of exciting applications\nthis way. Okay. There we go. Fusion Tables layer\nworks like the other layers. You just create\na new Fusion Tables layer. In this case,\nI pass in a query. If all I want to show\nis my fusion table without refining or filtering\nthe query at all, I can just provide\nthe table ID. Otherwise,\nthe sequel-like syntax, where you can say average age\nis above 40, and then if I want it to be\na heat map or not, I just set heat map\nto true or false. If I want to set it,\nit's the same as other layers. Just call \"set map,\"\nor call \"set map,\" \"pass,\" and \"null\" to clear it. So that's just a tiny bit of\nthe features of Fusion Tables. If you want to learn more\nabout Fusion Tables, how it integrates\nwith the Maps API, and some new features\nwe're launching, you should go to the\n\"Managing and Visualizing Your Geospatial Data\nwith Fusion Tables\" session, which is today at 1:15. With that,\nI'll bring up Aaron. There you go. Jacobs:\nThanks, Ossama. Is this on?\nYes. Thanks, Ossama.\nAnd, hi, everybody. I'm here to talk about\nMaps API web services and the Static Maps API. What is the Maps API\nweb service? Well, in contrast\nto the user-facing APIs that Ossama discussed--\nthe JavaScript, Flash, Static Maps API and so on--\nthis is a database service for you to call from your\nnative code or backend server and to consume information\nin JSON or XML. It lets you benefit\nfrom Google's expertise in geospatial data, so you can\ndo geocoding to find out where a street address\nis on Earth, in latitude/longitude, and\nother information about it. You can do directions queries\nand more, which I'm going\nto talk about here. I do remember that we have\na terms of service that requires you to eventually\ndo something with this data on a Google map,\nthrough the JavaScript, Flash, Static Maps API,\nEarth API, so the idea here is you can do further\ncomputation with your server or your application\nand eventually display a map to a user\ndoing something intelligent based on the results\nof that computation. Oh, also, I should mention,\nmost of the services I'm going to talk about here\nare also available in the JavaScript API,\nso look at the documentation for that to see that you can\nalso use it from the client if that's appropriate\nfor your app. So the first one\nI'm going to talk about that you may have missed\nis the Elevation API. Now this is exactly\nwhat it sounds like. It allows you to give us a line\nor a set of points and to find out the elevation\nof those points on earth. That's both elevation\nabove sea level and below sea level\nfor points that are underwater in oceans and lakes. This uses our cool bathymetry\ndata that we have that you can see on\nGoogle Earth, previously. Now you could use this\nto visualize elevation profiles or do intelligent things\nfor bikers or walkers and other stuff\nthat I haven't thought of. You guys are the creative ones. It's really easy to use. For example, here I have sort of\na trivial request that says, \"Given a path from lat. long.\n0-0 to 0-10--\" this is from the Atlantic Ocean\nto the shore of Africa-- \"sample this path three times.\" You could use\na much larger number. This is for my example. \"And tell me the elevations\nof the points along that path.\" So you get back\na JSON or XML response that looks something like this. You see we sampled it at 3.00010\nand one in the middle, and you can see that you go\nfrom approximately 5 kilometers under the ocean\nto a little bit shallower, to about sea level as you hit\nthe coast of Africa. It's that easy to use. Check out the documentation. It has a couple other\nclever features, like you can specify points\nas addresses if that's helpful for you. Another service\nI'd like to talk about that we launched last week is\ncalled the Distance Matrix API. This is where you have a set\nof origins and destinations, and you want to find out for\neach pair of origin/destination how far they are\nfrom each other. Now, this is in terms of\ndrive time and drive distance or walk time and walk distance,\nnot as the crow flies, so this can be pretty useful\nto you. It uses our Directions\nAPI data. So for example, if you want\nto find out how far it is from L.A. to San Diego and-- sorry, from L.A. or San Diego\nto San Francisco or Sacramento, you would make a request\nthat looks like this-- you see it's very easy--\nand get back this information. Now what's this good for?\nYou could, for example, use this to make\nan advance store finder app, which given a set of\nyour stores or locations or whatever it is that\nyou are displaying, and the user's location,\nor a couple of users' locations, home and work, you can do intelligent things\nbased on this, much smarter than getting the\nclosest store as the crow flies, which might involve\na heavily trafficked road or something like that. Yes. Another directions related\nservice is route optimization. Now, if you've used\nthe Directions API, you know that you can give\nan origin and a destination. Say the user wants to go\nfrom A to D, via B and C, so that means you need to hit\npoints B and C in the middle. Previously, if you tell us this,\nwe'll just naively follow the set of points\nthat you specify, but this may not be optimum. What we allow you to do is,\nin your way point list, you can say \"optimize true,\"\nand what we'll do is we'll reorder those\nintermediate way points for you so that the user,\nor whoever's traveling, has the most efficient route\nthrough all these points. This is known as the\ntraveling salesman problem, for those who are familiar\nfrom computer science. As with all of the things\nI've mentioned so far, it's very easy to use.\nYou just say \"optimize, true.\" We hold the origin\nand destination fixed because we assume that's\nwhere the user wants to start and wind up,\nand we do the magic for you. We'll give back\nthe right directions based on the optimum order,\nand if your application needs to know how they were\nreordered for some reason, we return the field\ncalled \"way point order\" that tells you that. So for example,\nwith this query here, I've generated a few maps\nusing aesthetic Maps API-- or one map actually--\nso this is from L.A. to New York via these intermediate cities. The red path is what you'll get\nif you do it in the naive order, and you can see\nthat it crisscrosses all over the country. It's very inefficient\nand probably takes a few days. Whereas the green path,\nyou see it's been reordered to do this in an efficient way. So yeah, it's exactly\nwhat it sounds like. Another directions-related\nfeature is bicycling directions. So previously\nin the Directions API, we only supported\ndriving and walking, and you guys are probably\nfamiliar with these from maps.google.com, which allows you to get\ndirections, as you know. We've added support\nfor bicycling directions, and all you do is say\n\"mode equals bicycling,\" and we'll use what we know\nabout bike paths and local roads and that sort of thing\nto find routes that are suitable for biking. So for example, here's a trip from--sorry, from Santa Monica\nto Hollywood in L.A., and if you're familiar with\nL.A., you see this red path, which is the driving path--\ntakes a couple of freeways that you really don't\nwant to take on a bike. But the green path takes\nbike paths and local roads, and it's probably\nquite a bit more pleasant. We also of course adjust all\nof the drive--sorry, ride times and that sort of thing\naccording to biking speed. Moving on, another announcement\nthat we're making-- or have made recently,\nexcuse me-- is that now everybody is allowed\nto use SSL for our web services and JavaScript requests. If you're not familiar with SSL,\nthis is a way to encrypt the data\nthat the browser or your code sends to Google\nso that nobody in between can snoop on it. You can use this if you have\nsensitive user application data that you don't want anybody\nin the middle to see. And it's just kind of\na good idea for the Internet, for users' data. Previously this was a feature\nthat was only available to Maps API Premier customers,\nbut now you can all use it. Everybody can use it. It's very easy. All you do is make sure\nyou're sending your request to maps.googleapis.com,\nand change your URLs to use HTTPs,\nand it's that simple. You don't need to make\nany other changes. Right, so moving on to\nthe Static Maps API. The Static Maps API is an\nalternative to the JavaScript and Flash and Earth APIs,\nwhich are for interactive maps that are sort of immersive\nfor the user. They can drag them around\nand zoom in and out and do what they like. If you're in an environment\nwhere you don't have JavaScript or Flash available, or where\nlatency is absolutely critical, what the Static Maps API\nallows you to do is create an appropriate URL that will return a map image\nthat can contain markers and polylines\nand custom icons, but is not otherwise\ninteractive. And you simply stick\nthat in an image tag, and now you have a map on your\nsite, or in your mobile app, or whatever environment\nyou're in. I should mention,\nthere is a requirement that if you're in a mobile app\nor anything like that, you need to link back to\nmaps.google.com in some manner. But it's very easy to use. You simply give a size,\nand you can say--for example, if you want to show\na map of Australia with these cities\nhighlighted with markers, all you do is\nmake a URL like this. You get back a map like this.\nIsn't that beautiful? I have a couple Static Maps\nAPI features to discuss. The first one is\nhigh-resolution static maps. So for example, if you are\non a mobile device with a high DPI screen or you\nneed a map for printing purposes or anything like that,\nwhat you can do is tell us to upscale the map\nby 2x or 4x. And what we'll do is\nwe'll give you a map back that has twice or four times as\nmany pixels in each dimension, and more rendering detail. So when you show that map\nat the same physical size on the mobile screen or printed,\nit will look better. It will look less fuzzy. It's pretty easy to use. You just say \"scale equals two,\"\n\"scale equals four.\" If you have custom icons\nfor your markers, there's a way to specify\nthat these are the appropriate resolution, and\nwe will render them correctly. So for example, here's a map\nof Sydney at our usual scale, and I will show you one\nat 2x scale which-- imagine it has gotten\ntwice as large and is now outside\nthe bounds of the slide. It's kind of hard to show\non a projector, but you see that all of\nthe labels have gotten larger, the road detail\nhas gotten larger, there's more rendering detail\nthere. So now if you shrunk this back\ndown to the same physical size, it would look better\nfor your user. See the documentation for more\nexplanation of how this works. Finally, one other feature\nis custom static map styles. Now, this is also available in\nthe JavaScript and Flash APIs. But it's this\nreally nifty feature that allows you to change the\ndefault styling of Google Maps to fit the branding\nof your application or product, or to emphasize particular data\nby de-emphasizing other data, or coloring it\nor however you like. It's based on a set\nof style parameters in the Static Maps API, where you give\na list of features that you'd like to restyle--\nfor example, roads or water or anything like that-- elements\nyou'd like to restyle, like their labels\nor their geometry or both, and then\na way to restyle them-- for example,\nchanging their color to something\nthat's bluish here. Let me give you an example. This is a map of the area\naround the Moscone Center where we currently are. You can see\nit's in the Google style that we all know and love,\nhopefully. And if you change it, you can change it\nrelatively significantly. I've re-colored the roads\nto be blue, done some desaturation. I've turned off some labels, for example the P and the--\nI can't read it from here, but these labels. And you see it's all gone. You've significantly changed\nthe look and feel of the map. Now we have a--if you Google\nfor \"styled map wizard,\" we have this nifty tool\nthat will let you interactively create these styles. And you can see\nthat it's pretty powerful. So for example,\nhere's a map of San Francisco. I can easily change the water\nto red, say add style, and for example, change\nthe roads to green, and now I have a map that seems\nquite a bit different. It's also very ugly.\nPlease be careful with this, but it's up to you to make\nthings that look nice and emphasize what you want\nto emphasize. Excuse me, I need to go\nback to my slides. So in summary,\nGeo APIs at Google. There are a lot of them. It's not just\nthe JavaScript Maps API. We have Flash,\nwe have Earth, we have all of\nthe other products that have geo-integration\nthat Ossama mentioned. The Maps API itself\nhas a ton of features. You often just see maps\nthat are a base map and markers and that's it.\nGo beyond that. You can make great\nuser experiences. Fusion Tables is a powerful\nplatform for storing your data and visualizing it\nin even more advanced ways. We have the Earth API for all these interactive\nawesomeness and trees. And we have secure web services\nthat you can talk to from your back end, make sure user data doesn't go\nout from the browser, optimize for latency,\nwhatever you need. And we have the static map. The Static Maps API, when JavaScript and Flash\naren't an option, or you need to optimize\nfor latency again, as I said. With that, I'm going to say\nthank you. I'm going to invite Ossama up\nfor Q&A, and I'm going to mention, if you'd like to give us\nsome feedback on this talk, please do. Here's a short link\nthat you can visit to give us feedback.\nThank you. Alami:\nThanks very much. Jacobs: Does anybody\nhave any questions? Alami:\nGo ahead at the mic. man: So a couple\nquick questions in relation to Fusion Tables. For one, how large\nof a fusion table do you guys support, and like,\ncould I upload a million points? Alami: I believe we support\nup to 150 megs. man:\nOkay. Alami: But you can purchase\nlarger amounts. man:\nOkay. And then the second question is,\nI know they come back as images. Is there a special on-click\nevent where I can hook in and have first priority\non getting the data of where the point is? And I'll give you\nmy specific use case. Really nice to have\nall those as an image because it's less--\nAlami: Right. man: It's more performant,\nthere's no DOM elements. But if I have a user\nthat hits a mouse down and clicks\non the actual point, I'd like to be able to\ninflate it as a regular DOM element. Is that something\nI can hook into through an event and get back the dimensions\nof the place? Alami: Yes.\nman: Okay. Alami: So we do expose events\nbased on clicks, and you could also query\nFusion Tables API separately, but we do expose that through\nthe Fusion Tables layer. man: Okay, so I just take that\nand I can drop it into a new mount marker,\nsort of, its own parameters and it'll just create one\nat that point? Alami: That's right.\nman: Cool. Alami:\nWe'll take the front. man: So last I checked the--\nsorry, the Maps API for GWT is stuck on Version 2.\nIs that still the case, and do you have plans\nto update that? Alami: I don't know\nthe answer to that. I know there are--\nsorry. The question was,\nthe Maps API for GWT is currently on Version 2. I know there are a couple\nof open-source Version 3 implementations\nof the Maps API. I don't know what the current\nplan is for Version 2, the GWT implementation. We'll--back mic. man: I've got two\nquick questions. One is, I saw you color-code\nvarious states on the USA map. Do you actually ship political\nboundaries that we could use, or do we have to get it\nourselves? Alami: So the question was,\non the U.S. map for the Fusion Tables example, I showed U.S. Congressional\ndistrict boundaries. Where did I get that data? I actually pulled that data\nfrom Fusion Tables. We have a large set\nof public tables that we've made available\nas well as users who have contributed data and\nmade that available publicly. So in Fusion Tables,\nall you have to do-- all I searched for, in fact, was\nU.S. Congressional districts, and it's the first table\nI found. man:\nI see, I see. I have two more\nquick questions. One is, in a typical map,\nis there an upper limit to how many markers\nI can display-- like, can I display\n20,000 markers? Alami: Yes, so there\nis an upper limit. The question was-- Jacobs: How many markers\ncan you show on a map? We do pretty well these days\nwith lots of them, with thousands even, but if you have, like,\na truly ridiculous number, you can use something like\nFusion Tables or a KML layer or two\nto offload some of that work to the server side and save\nthe browser from doing it, and it's even more performant.\nAlami: Yeah. Specifically,\nthere is no hard limit. You can continue to add\nas many markers as you like. Your browser performance\nwill suffer. man: I see.\nAlami: Yeah. man: And the last question is,\nsay I have a database that has like 1 million\naddresses, customer addresses. Is there a tool\nGoogle offers to convert them\ninto lats and longitude? Alami: So the question was,\nif you have a database full of addresses,\nand you wanted to geocode all those addresses--\nso if you upload them to Fusion Tables, Fusion Tables will take care\nof the geocoding. Jacobs: There also\nis the opportunity to use the geocoding\nweb service, which is one of those\nweb services I mentioned. You do need to make sure\nthat you're within the terms of service, using\nthis with a map eventually. I'm not sure of the details.\nSorry, I'm not a lawyer. But you can use either\nof these methods. man: Thank you.\nGreat presentation. Jacobs:\nThank you. man: I had a small question\nregarding the Sun Cells input. Is there anything for,\nfor example, compass, gyroscope, or any\naccelerational movement? So basically, in the API,\nif the compass moves around, do you have any simple input\nor do you need to use a 0, 90, and 180 and so on? Alami: So the question\nwas if there's any tie-in to sensors on the phone,\nfor instance, gyroscope. There isn't anything specific\nin the Maps API. You'd have to code\nthat yourself. Jacobs: You can of course\nget it from the HTML5, support for it, or I think\nthere are other technologies-- I'm not too familiar with this--\nbut no, we don't have anything canned for you,\nsorry. man:\nOkay. Thanks. Alami: I will do\nthe back mic. man: Yes. Is it possible to\nwork in offline mode? No Internet? Alami: The question was, will\nthe maps work in offline mode? The answer is no.\nJacobs: Yeah. Alami: We load map tiles\nfrom our servers, as well as if you use\nservices like geocoding, or you rely on any of those. It requires an Internet\nconnection to make that work. man: What if we have\nEnterprise database? Alami: It would still require\nInternet connection to make that work. The one--sorry,\nthe follow-up question, I've been told by everybody\nto repeat the questions. The follow-up question was\nwhat if you have an Enterprise database\nor something. There is a product called\nGoogle Earth Enterprise, which will let you-- man: That's what\nI was talking about. Alami:\nYeah. So I actually don't know\nthe specifics about that, but if you visit us\nin office hours, or in the sandbox,\nI can find somebody to answer that question\nfor you. Jacobs:\nMaybe at the front here? man: Do you have any integration\nwith Google Latitude? Alami:\nThe question was, are there any integration\noptions with Google Latitude? There are no canned\nimplementations. There is\nno canned integration, so you would have to write\nthat on your own. man:\nOkay, great, thank you. Alami:\nSure. Jacobs:\nIn the back? man: The Fusion Tables--\nyou mentioned there was a 150 data point limit\non that. Is there a way to\nlayer multiple ones of those? Jacobs: It's actually\n150 megs, I think. man:\nOh, 150 megs? Jacobs: So you can put\na lot of data in there. man: Okay, I've got\nmore than that easily. Is there a way that you can\nlayer multiple layers on top of each other--\nto, let's say, do a northwest region\nor southwest region-- and then put those layers and generate heat maps\nbased on that? Alami: Yeah.\nThe question was, can I layer multiple Fusion\nTables layers on top of the map, and the answer is yes. man:\nExcellent. Alami: I believe\nyou can do up to five? Jacobs: You might need to be\nclever about what to do with the boundaries, especially if you're\ndoing heat maps, but I'll leave that\nup to you. man: Great.\nThank you very much. man: My question is on metadata\nand coverage information. For example, when you set the\ntilt to the 45 degrees, to 45, what happens if the data\nis not available for the area? And in general, I want to ask about coverage\ninformation, like, given the latitude and longitude\nof a city, do we have historical data\nthe area--for the area? I wish you can create\nlike a Google Maps API database offline, manual UI\nbase, to give that information. That would be very valuable. Alami:\nSo a couple of questions. The first was what happens\nif you call \"set tilt\" on 45-degree imagery and we don't have\nthat imagery available. It'll simply just show\nthe satellite mode and-- Jacobs: More generally,\ndo we have information available about where we have\nvarious types of imagery, and I don't know the answer. Alami: You can query for imagery\nwithin the Earth API, but we do not have\na web service that you can hit,\nor something within the Maps API that you can query\nfor historical imagery. man: Okay. man: A few questions\non other layers you might have. Do you have U.S. ZIP codes? Alami: The question\nwas on additional layers. You can just search\nFusion Tables. I don't know\noff the top of my head what we have loaded in there,\nand in fact, people have made\nlayers available that I don't know about, so simply go to\ngoogle.com/Fusion Tables and search for\nwhatever you want, or you can browse\npublic layers. man: And so\nthis is relatively new, and-- Are you expecting a lot\nof user-contributed data? Jacobs:\nPlease contribute, yes. Alami:\nYeah. Fusion Tables--\nwhen did we-- so Fusion Tables came out of lab\nseveral quarters ago. It is now not only-- man:\nFormally part of the API? Alami:\nIt is-- Jacobs: It's sort of\nan independent product, but we have a little bit of,\nyou know, nice integration here in the Fusion Tables layer\nthat Ossama described. man: Okay.\nAlami: Yeah. And we are,\nto answer your question, yes, we are seeing quite a bit\nof usage of Fusion Tables since we launched. man: Thanks.\nJacobs: Up front. woman: Do you provide\nany documentation on the heuristic that you use\nfor the optimization, for the routing?\nJacobs: No, we don't. And I personally don't know,\nbut I could speculate with you if you grab me later. woman:\nOkay. man: So we all have\nthese Android tablets with beautiful\nVector Google maps. Are you planning on bringing\nthat to the browser and opening the Vector Maps API\nto developers on browser and mobile? Alami: The question was about\nvector maps on the browser, and the answer is,\nwe typically don't comment on our future product plans. man:\nOkay. Jacobs: Agreed that it would\nbe sweet though. man: Right.\nJacobs: Yeah. man: Hi. The Maps API that\nreturns the JSON objects-- I've tried that\nwith Google App Engine, and I've, like, been immediately\nconfronted with-- I guess it's like a 403 or\nsomething, you know, forbidden. I've exceeded my quota. And I assume it's just because\nsomeone else on that node exceeded it. I was wondering if there's\na way to use a key for that. Jacobs: So yes,\nso this is a difficulty that we run into in shared\nhosting environments. Sorry, the question was,\nI'm on App Engine or something with a shared IP,\nand I get lots of quota denials in the web services,\ngeocoding or whatever. This is a problem that we run\ninto because of shared IPs. It's hard to tell who's a user,\nwho's not. There is of course\nMaps API Premier that you could sign up for\nand get a key, if you have, like,\na big project. Otherwise, maybe you can try\nto do it on the client where we have a more clever\nstrategy for telling who's an independent user,\nthat sort of thing. I don't have a good answer\nfor you right now, but grab me afterward. Twenty seconds, if that's\na quick question back there. man: I'll try to make it quick.\nJacobs: Yeah. man: So let's say\nthat I wanted to generate a heat map off of\nprivate data, say the last seven days\nof sales, and it's rapidly changing. I wouldn't want to upload that\ninto Fusion Tables before I make the render\nrequest, right? So how would I integrate\nthat kind of live feed for my own private\nbook of record, basically, and generate a heat map\non top of this stuff? Alami: The question was about\ngenerating heat maps using a live data feed. Ultimately you do have to upload\nthis into Fusion Tables. You can keep the table\nprivate, so you're not required to make\nthis data public. Jacobs: Unfortunately, it's\na relatively computationally expensive process in general, so we're reliant on that\nat the moment anyway. man: Right.\nIf I could do a quick one. Alami:\nYeah. man: So one thing that we talked\nwith some of your guys about-- Alami:\nSorry. I'm getting a signal\nfrom the back, but if you do have\na follow-up question, we'll meet you afterwards.\nJacobs: Grab us outside. Sure. Alami:\nThank you. Jacobs:\nThank you.

golden day tea hovering around his palace the next day when he discussed the dream with his courtiers one of them said that the date he was no other than the Buddha of India the Emperor then dispatched a mission to India to invite the disciples of Buddha to China to breach his teachings the mission brought back to Indian monks cusamano Dharma and Dharma Ratna the Chinese government built a Great Wall Street on the outskirts of the eastern Han capital knowyour to accommodate the holy ending guests and to start the propagation of Buddhist teachings as the two Indians arrived riding white horses the monastery was christened the monastry of white horses owned by Massey this is where the seeds of Buddhism was sown in China the historical by Mercy monastery in Luoyang attracts Buddhist mice and tourists from all over Asia till this day encouraged by the reception given to the monks at the White House monster where these scholars began to call into China from Central Asia particularly from ancients of biana and Kucha however by the 3rd century they were anxious to come in direct contact with India Buddhist scholars in India responded to this as hundreds of them went to China either by the overland route or by seen carrying with them collections of Buddhist texts not available in China - me was the most flourishing center of Buddhist learning in this period a number of monks came to China from Kashmir and translated large amounts of Buddhist texts into Chinese one of the first Kashmiri scholars to go to China was sunburned booty he reached the northern capital in 381 ad the most important of his works was an extensive commentary on the Disciplinary code of Buddhism while Sangha booty was still working in China another scholar of a more outstanding genius arrived in the Chinese capital from Kashmir this was Gautama Sangha Deva Sangha Devas specialized in metaphysical literature of Buddhism and he translated a few Sanskrit texts by the 7th century Nalanda began to at the same room and with this propaganda in China as Kashmir in the earlier period one of the most noted scholars of Nalanda was prabhakara McDonough he settled in the monastery of Malaga studied the philosophical texts with the greatest Buddhist teacher of the age named Sina Butler he translated a number of works into Chinese the first travelers from China to India were probably traders the Chinese traders from southwestern China and Central Asia had been visiting India periodically and they were responsible for introducing many things in doing their early Sanskrit verses refer to Chinese silt as one of the most prized commodities the Chinese merchants also introduced amongst other things vermilion or Sindhu and things made of Chinese bamboo but while these merchants were plotting towards India through the hilly tracts of Burma and Assam and across the deserts of Central Asia to upper India the Chinese intelligentsia was still indifferent to India but Buddhism took stronger roots in China after the visit of Chinese pilgrims to India in the middle of the 3rd century AD and stayed in a monastery specially built for them in both gaya from the 4th century the Chinese Buddhist began to take a keener interest in India and the Indian culture the first among the enterprising monks ready to come to India was far he who began his journey in 399 ad after crossing Central Asia he reached northwestern India in 402 a demon settling at Bartley put the but he intensively studied ernie sanskrit buddhist sutras especially those on the rules of the monastic community he subsequently spent two years in sri lanka where he continued his studies finally sailing for China he reached after a long and difficult voyage and spent the rest of his life translating his collected texts into Chinese the account that far has left of his travels in India is a valuable record of Buddhism he was not interested in any other thing except the sacred literature of Buddhism especially its god of discipline which till then was not available in China India in this period was known in China as the country of Buddha hence the account of his journey is entitled for quirky or the record of the country of Buddha the person who played perhaps the greatest role in the history of sign of Indian cultural relations was Suzanne born in a family of Confucian scholars he converted to Buddhism he decided to go and study in the great with the Centers of India and set out in 629 despite an imperial order restraining him he arrived in northeastern India in 633 where he studied sanskrit and buddhist sutras intensively and visited sites associated with the Buddha his prestige in India grew so great that he enjoyed a royal patronage he made personal contact with King harsha of ganache in 643 he began his return journey and reached China in 645 taking with him 657 Buddhist writings in 520 packages he was given our hero's welcome the Emperor built the big goose pagoda in Chanda to welcome that great hero back from his travels in the Western world Zooey's egg declined the emperors of war of a government post and devoted himself to religion he spent the rest of his years translating Buddhist sutras into Chinese had the big goose pagoda Zhu and Zhang is also remembered in India till this day by the zoo in Zhang temple in Calcutta the last great Chinese pilgrim to come to India was easy he spent 10 years in Nalanda studying the subtlest philosophy of Buddhism with the greatest Buddhist teacher of the age see lavada when he returned to China he had with him a collection of 400 manuscripts he also compiled a Sanskrit Chinese dictionary although the great period of the sino-indian relations practically came to an end towards the middle of the ninth century Chinese monks continued to come to India at irregular intervals up to the middle of the 11th century the Chinese inscriptions set up at both gaya have some of these records thus I know he did but this connection was responsible for the joint creation of Mahayana ISM the form of Buddhism though Mahayana Buddhism originated in India it was the contribution of the Chinese Buddhist that made it a greater force of socio-political change in China than in India of course through Tibet while the Chinese accepted it but with modification Indian it was was you know based on non-violence but the Chinese they modified into violent means they said that Buddhism preaches egalitarianism and therefore everybody should be equal under the heaven so therefore we have the right to overthrow the king the bad kid and restore another one who is good so how to struggle in the ethics came into China through Buddhism that we can see among all the Indian monks kumara Jeeva was the most prominent his contribution to producer exceeds all other Indian monks Kamaraju was the first to head a Chinese eg1 the sutra translation bureau he headed a group comprising thousands of Chinese and foreign monk scholars who worked on scores of important translations the northern Chinese Overlord the yahoos II personally supervised their world kumara Jeeva would recite a line of the scriptures without any text before him he then explained the meaning both in Sanskrit and in Chinese there followed an open discussion among the other scholars on the most appropriate Chinese translation which was finally approved by kumara Jeeva even today these writings are held to be superior to those of later Chinese scholars the kumara Jeeva episode was a unique indo-chinese joint-venture input this translation the Chinese translation bureau survived kumara Jeeva for nearly a thousand years and created in total seven thousand plus chapters of translated literature this is the greatest and most enduring joint venture in translation in world history kumara G woman died in China in 430 and is remembered till this day by his tomb in Xi'an [Music] [Music] China's most famous martial arts tradition hakufu was developed by a prominent Indian mark Bodhidharma he arrived in China in the 6th century after a little trek over the immigrants and went to Luoyang and settled at the Shaolin Temple here buddhadharma was moved by the terrible physical condition of the monks the monks had practiced long term meditation retreats which made them spiritually strong but physically wait what the monks needed was a balance between meditation and physical training even created an exercise program which involved physical techniques and strengthened the body and could also be used in self-defense Bodhidharma disciples imitated the natural movements of birds and animals developing these exercises over years into a form of unarmed combat when building dharma is due to these practices his sole ambition was to make the monks physically strong it turned out that the tinks served a dual births as martial arts training to help the monks to defend themselves against invading wall and stand bandits [Music] boarded honey taught that martial arts should be used in self-defense and never to hurt or ingenuously body then mugging for a shuttle a family in South LA therefore the roots of Shaolin martial arts can be traced to kalaripayattu the martial art form of Carroll collaborative is a method of physical fitness and empty healthiness of self-defense shall we the monastry in Luoyang until this day still reminds us a great Indian cultural ambassador to China every year thousands of Chinese enroll at Charlene's martial art schools some students have found stardom from years of practicing and have also appeared in martial arts movies another example of the Indian influence on Chinese culture is the Chinese inclusion of gold as a substance of value India was a land famous for gold a rare metal in ancient China the most precious thing for the Chinese was Jade known as you while in Sanskrit there were three words for gold the Chinese word gin stood for gold silver and copper during the period of the Tang Dynasty the Chinese took a leaf from the Buddhist books and attributed the best value to gold and monopolized the word gin to describe it you the traditional symbol for the most precious thing lost its value a simple thing like sugar illustrates and flows into the pendant relation the two countries while China learned how to manufacture sugar from India the technique of turning bread molasses into white sugar migrated from China into India thus the world Gini indicates a Chinese origin the form of jaggery was called Shankara and not Cheaney if we can see that French call it sugar English call it sugar you know Russians call it sahar Germans call it sugar Arabic they say super super they say so all these words have come from chakra the Chinese transported these decolorized small granulates to India back again it became Chile China assimilated many aspects of Indian culture over more than a thousand years in such a way that today the original Indian identity can hardly be traced an indian visitor coming upon an obscure monument in a remote area of china will be surprised to see familiar symbols like the swastika the lotus that ressure the bodhisattva and the up sighs all harmonized with a local cultural menu Buddhism acted as a vehicle not only to carry the scriptures from India to China but also transmitted the seeds of popular ethics through tales and fables the famous Panchatantra tales influenced the Chinese so much that they trance created ethical tales and fables of their own with indigenous flavours the epigram iron made a deep impact on some of the Chinese inhabitants in the tropical yunnan province Chinese tribes tell and retell stories that have characters that entirely correspond to God and Sita the introduction of Buddhist art into China is closely associated with the arrival of modern and Parma ratna along with an icon of Buda to the Han Emperor Ming when Buddhism was slowly infiltrating into China under the patronage of the cochons which was the first period of the spread of Buddhism Gandhi Hara and Kashmir took the leading role a hybrid would the start evolved in Northwest India that was Karen to China and in distinguished itself with well-defined characteristics it made use of Greek architectural motives such as the Corinthian villa in regard to composition it gives representation to the scenes from the life of the Buddha and also depicts the stories of his former birth chinese missionaries from there took the elements of Hindu Greek art which was prevalent there as more of focused India ranged itself behind the foreign missions the matura and gupta styles of the distaff were also carried abroad thus there are different stages in the evolution of Buddhist art in China also the Chinese pilgrims who have gone to India were equally active in inspiring the artists in China they brought back pictures statues and images of the Buddha and even the model of the Nalanda temple the vestiges of Indian art have been discovered by archaeologists all along the chief cultural occurs towards China such as bactrian Casca cooca darvon and tallulah they have discovered remains of Buddhist sculptures and paintings but the most important work of art are the rocket with these temples of Don Juan you can and long men to immediately visiting these

hewn into soft sedimentary rock they are embellished with magnificent murals StuCo sculptures and Victoria remains such as silk banners and canopies the Dunois wall paintings show a wide range of subjects such as proton and Bodhisattva figures Jatakas seems when Buddha's life Sutra illustrations mahesuan peacocks and the chariots of the Sun and Moon the Indian influence is marked by partial nudity of fitness blunders and engine type countenances these are the three two centers of Buddhist art in China [Music] Buddhist architecture tour in China has Indian influence in fact it is believed that the pagoda type of temples which superimpose stories was carried from India to the Far East the vestiges of such constructions are still found in India and far away from the regions where the Chinese influence could penetrate Indian influences are apparent in pagoda architecture many temples in China with their superimposed series of roofs their outstretched brackets from which hang bells their golden pinnacles carved pillars belong to the first period of sino-indian our [Music] Oh [Music] the ancient Chinese were great musicians and the court also admired foreign music orchestra various countries used to visit the Chinese courts Indian music was scattered to culture along with Buddhism and there is evidence of the families of Indian musicians having migrated in future in early times astronomy and astrology played a very important part in ancient Chinese culture as in India it was believed in both countries that the planets influence and guide the destiny of men in the 7th century AD three Indian astronomical schools were started at chunker the Indian calendar was introduced with the Sun in the moon the five planets and two new runs da Rahu and Ketu trade with China continued over the years for centuries Indian ports were regular points of call for Chinese ships the prosperity of the chola empire in southern india was largely based on trade with China in the early years of the Ming Dynasty 1368-1644 China was an economically developed country in order to strengthen contacts with the outside world the ming emperor zhudi decided to send his envoy on a sea voyage cheng ho hailing from the southern province of Yunnan leading up mammoths crowd of 27800 personnel comprising sailors army commanders physicians artisans in a grand fleet of 62 ships set off from their voyage from Nanjing a maritime port passing through several kingdoms they finally reached Kerala where he bartered pasal a silk iron and copper where's gold and silver this sea silk route of Cheng ho set a milestone in the history of sino-indian contacts with special reference to Kerala we are aware that Cochin in Kerala is home to the exquisite chinese fishing nets but how many of us know how these nets reached kerala there is an interesting link between chenggao and the chinese fishing nets Cochin and Callaghan for the seaports where the Chinese junks anchored careless trade relations with China developed during the first half of the 15th century much before the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498 in the process of interaction with China Kerala received various Chinese trade items one of which was the fishing net that Dragon Boat Festival in China has parallels in Manipur and Kerala the well-known Beijing opera depicts tales from Chinese classics the actors and actresses paint their faces with various colors deers can draw parallels to the cavatelli dances of Kerala Cheng hos visit to Kerala was a truly de sisse factor in this respect trade relations not only existed earlier via sea trade and on the Silk Route but even later with Canton tre captain trade was conducted between private forum and Chinese citizens the chief characteristic of the Canton trade was its monopolistic structure the court authorized thirteen commercial firms known as the Hawks as sole agents of foreign trade the East India Company monopolized the British trade to Canton the company granted charters to private ships to sail from India to China under its license this trade was known as the country trade and the ships as country ships six out of every ten of the country's ships were originated from Bombay and two each from Bengal and Madras the country traders were mostly Englishmen but also included Indians and Parsees by the late 18th century there was a flourishing triangular trade between Canton India and England exports to India consisted of cloth camp [Music] sugar sugar candy and China while imports included raw cotton ivory sandalwood silver abacavir this country track accounted for 30% of the total British trade at Canton between 1764 and 1800 [Music] ancient history was a reelected during the common struggle in the two nations against their colonial oppressors India and China likewise became a semicolon when the Indian Mutiny occurred in 1857 it was a great inspiration to the Chinese people as a result the British launching of the second opium war against China was destructive during the Taiping rebellion many Indian soldiers in the British Army were driven by her sense of justice to defend to the piping volley the early Indian nationals and reformers were opposed to the opium trade and demanded as early as 1870 to stop the opium traffic in fact the boycott of British goods by the Indian people against the partition of Bengal was influenced by the impact of the Chinese boycott of imperialistic girls Chinese leaders like Sun yat-sen maintained close contacts and established cooperation with well-known Indian revolutionaries he also advocated in 1923 the sino-indian unification of two of the most ancient cultures in the world Rabindranath Tagore's association with china was even earlier to that of narrow Tagore a visited

are differences between two countries for different reasons because of this relation they respect dr. cotton is so much in love him in August 1939 Nehru himself visited China Nell was honored as a great leader of the Indian people and an intimate friend of China he was warmly received by Chiang kai-shek the Chinese was solidly behind the just down of the Indian Congress in obtaining a firm British commitment before participating in the British war against Germany first ad Japan later on October the 31st 1941 when the news of the arrest of Nehru was known the Chinese were vocal in their support for his release Generalissimo Chiang kai-shek specifically flew to India in 1942 the main aim of his visit was to break the Indian political deadlock on behalf of the Chinese he did a spit to pressurize the British government to grant full independence to India the Chinese people were not only concerned with the Indian national as is clear when they supported the quit India movement but also with the sufferings of the Indian people when famine broke out in Bombay Bihar and many other places in India in 1943 they collected donations from people from all walks of life in China to help Indians the India China new nation Brotherhood was fall immediately after the birth of two new government's the People's Republic of China came into existence first of October on the 26th of January in 1950 was the Republic of India founded with the president a sincere independent India was the second country to establish diplomatic ties with and recognize the newest China China became independent of free you know from the colonialist clutches approximately at the same time India in 1947 and China in 1949 we had communist throughout the history it is a fallacy if somebody says that we are of different kinds we are not all different kinds we are still people of the Orient and we should unite hands to do things even till today so during that freedom struggle as we had a united ourselves so even after independence we had very good between the two countries China is today the world's fastest-growing economy and its achievements in the economic transformation of the country are truly remarkable likewise India in the last 12 years has reported an average annual growth of nearly 6 percent there has been an annual growth rate of 30 percent in bilateral trade between China and India both countries stand ready to strengthen economic cooperation and exchanges with each other both countries have realized the full potential of their partnership [Music] looking at this year 7 billion dollar bilateral trade which shows that historically there is a huge trend of faster growth in the bilateral trade between India and China the two biggest economies size while at least from the point of view of population in Asia and the fastest growth in economic areas in these two countries is sort of propping of the whole world's group today if you see the economic growth of the world for the last year practically 30 to 40 percent came because of the development which took place in India and China so from that point of view I feel there is a great historical sort of connection here and you will see the bilateral trade reached a ten billion dollar mark very soon this century per se sensory aphasia and I see the lot of economic development which is happening in China which Indian companies or Indian corporations can take party in the same way I feel there's a lot of potential for Chinese companies to go into India invest in India and be part of the fast growth that our economies are seeing today so from that point of view I personally am very very positive in this old friend and I see it as a historic trend and as we go over the years this is going to become better and better in September 1993 during the visit of the ten Prime Minister XI narsimha Rao to China the two sides signed an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility along the line of actual control on the India China border followed by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in December 1988 India and China agreed to seek a fair reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement of the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultations Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited in June 2003 this was the first visit of an Indian prime minister to China in almost a decade ten agreements and the joint declaration on principles for relations and comprehensive cooperation between India and China were concluded on the 23rd of June the joint declaration was signed by the Indian Prime Minister and Premier Wen Jiabao it was the first ever joint document of its kind signed by the leaders of the two countries the declaration outlines the principles and shared perspectives which will guide the future development of bilateral relations the premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China mr. Wen Jiabao during his recent visit to the Republic of India in April 2005 had an in-depth exchange of views with dr. Manmohan Singh in a friendly and constructive atmosphere and reached a broad consensus on bilateral relations and international and regional lines of common concern the two countries recalled the Declaration on principles for relations and comprehensive cooperation between the two prime ministers signed on the 23rd of June 1993 and reiterated that the declaration provided a shared vision of

"Hn2gQ_LCq1o": "hey guys it's Alexandra Williamson and I am talking to you on the channel the secret history living inside of your aquarium so recently I put in some algae which is just kind of a shrimp update on the population you can see we've got a wild-type it may have been a Jade shrimp or it could have been a chocolate shrimp that just kind of reverted I don't know that it's fully neo caridina I think it may have something else in it I don't know how they interbreed but it is a big big guy or girl should I say there are also brand new shrimp that were born last night clearly you can see them there they're about the size of a shrimps I almost and then there's the blue one there that was born within the week and you can see some really teeny ones up in here that have no color yet and then there's the one that was born two or three weeks ago right here so in this in this little frame right now we've got every stage of development pretty much from the shrimp adult that is our shrimp juvenile that is not quite ready to have it its young yet - the shrimp blitz which are only going to be filter feeding and then the the intermediate size where they start to show what their colors gonna be now we've got the albino ram's horn snails here we've got the pond snails here I put in some crab food like specifically for crabs and they seem to like that I hadn't fed them in a couple days they'd just been eating algae and fish food that was left over in the tank from a while back but this is a great way don't feed them for a couple days and then give them food and they'll all come to the wherever you put the food and if you establish a spot where that food is then you can kind of get a quell and I was gonna try to count the babies but I see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve there's over 30 right in this area on this rock but they're just hard to see but it's a good way to do it also you can see if you missed any calls so this one this striped shrimp will probably be called out although I do really like its patterns it's just it's gonna throw the line off and we'll have some funky shrimp this is a blue shrimp this dark black one actually in it is let's see if she's still pregnant yes she is still pregnant this other blue shrimp which is a true blue dream not a blue velvet but a blue tree she's clearly like ready to have babies any second now so that's also good news I don't see a single shrimp elsewhere in the tank out other than right here so yeah I don't think I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 okay so we've got like 16 shrimp in the tank right now which is a good number and you can see how much red are these shrimp are getting now that we've gotten we sold the Cole shrimp at to the local fish store and then we've been keeping the lesser grade shrimp separate and there's gonna be some mixing going on but right now we've got females the two blue females have only been with blue males before they were bearing eggs so as soon as they are not carrying eggs anymore they will go back up into this tank with the other blue dreams and blue Velvets I have decided to start mixing those strains because people know where they can get blue dreams and blue velvet strains online but I want to make cut of my own strain with some different traits and so we'll be doing that in the future but I just wanted to show you some really healthy shrimp these ones are doing great we've also got a soul tangerine in this Tay and we need to get some mates for for her yeah for her and we'll see how that goes we've also got back here now I'm seeing a almost translucent shrimp which is definitely not one I want in the population they color up with age a little bit as you'll see but once they reach about a quarter of an inch they don't get a ton they don't change their pattern a ton and so you can kind of tell what you want to pull out of the population but you know caridina shrimp are great for raising in a community tank as long as you're diligent and can definitely make sure there's not even one male in the tank that is not what you want and so as long as you're keeping track like like I have been I can keep track of the fact that there are only two blue females in here so I need to get them both out keep checking on them and then I also need to start culturing more in this tank and getting different different micro fauna and flora living in the tank so just an update right here we've got the ideal that the fire painted red you'd probably call that shrimp there this one's getting ready to molt but she is also a very strong colored shrimp the Blues are so blue that they're black and we've talked about that and then the albino ram's horn we've got one that's not quite as good and then we've got one that is the ideal that I'd like to see in this tank this tank also we're gonna start growing sea monkeys as they're known but brine shrimp if you want the official wording and also probably some more copepods and things because I need to feed by my other fish with those because we're gonna be breeding some new fish on the channel so you see you couldn't even tell that she was pregnant until she just swam upside down so I'm really excited to see her babies as I said it takes them six months to reach maturity so you have time to pull them out of the tank and you know by three months or so exactly what they're gonna look like and my local pet shop has no problem selling even like the lightest colored shrimp some people want them just as a natural kind of look like something like this or even the brown ones so I let them hang out in the tank but it's I just have to be very diligent on pulling out the calls as I go whereas this would hopefully she'll breed true she's only been with Sakura fires and she will go back being that her and him on the left there those two are the only Sakura's in the tank at this time and it's fine if he impregnates other females so it's fine if if good shrimp mate with lesser quality shrimp the males but it's not okay if the women are lesser quality and the men are lesser quality because you're just gonna go downhill and dilute the gene pool whereas I'm fine with working upwards with a nice male in the tank and then just to make sure to get those colors out so you really got to get rid of the blues before it's too late so to speak and also I thought it was kind of interesting you know you think of snails as these slow things but some of these snails actually move really quickly and do some funky weird stuff but yeah so there's the sakura male or female I should say you can't tell this occurs Sakura painted fires are pregnant unless you see their undercarriage and the males that's about as red as they'll get usually you can still see a little bit of ribbing on him but he's not completely like blood-red all the way through so the goal is to have more shrimp like her the one up top there and hopefully if he keeps mating with these ones will it will get that outcome closer and closer but just need to stay on top of the calling so that's the update from the shrimp tank here the shrimp tank up here we've got the tiger end lers or leopard end lers we've got some Cory cats and their shrimp in here somewhere there's rainbow fish neon rainbow fish in here now - hopefully we can get them breeding and the end lers will keep breeding we looks like we have a pregnant female endler right up front here and then this is now a shrimp tank also in that we've got the electric blues in here which are the blue dream and the blue velvet cross and if you look at my old video on shrimp genetics you'll know that blue dream in blue velvet even though they looked the same often they are from different lines of genetic morphing and so I think it'll make a stronger shrimp and I actually like the brighter blue some of that has to do with the substrate they're living on but I like that brighter blue so in the upcoming videos we're gonna be talking about some of what's dominant versus what's recessive we're gonna be talking about these Australian rainbow fish we're gonna be discussing the tank and the history of these rainbow fish and why people don't keep them very often because they think they're not that colorful but they're full of personality and they do get colorful as they spawn or as they become adults and this tank has really settled in with you know everybody's looking healthy and happy so I'm glad that this one's up and running now this is one that I'm having a debate about because she only stands to gain from the strong blue shrimp in this in this tank but she is technically a a inferior blue jelly and I don't know if she should stay in this tank if I put her in the other tank she'll be diluted ideally I should probably just get rid of her but yeah so she's kind of like oh she almost looks like a Pinto caridina but she's definitely neo caridina and she could maybe produce offspring that are inferior but they still have this blue color that I want so it's kind of like do I let them be with the dark blues or do I ain't come out and just let them be whatever as you can see the rainbow fish are ripping up my landscape so I need to rearrange some plants and pick some different things I think we're gonna go with all Australian and Papua New Guinean plants so we'll be doing more plant profiles will be talking mating and genetics and then we're gonna talk about the history of these species coming up as well and also how weather climate and some of the climate change has been impacting some of these fish it's kind of interesting what they've gone through and what some of the things are built in into their genetics for them to survive so I hope that you're enjoying this process watching our little shrimp family grow and you know now I've been I've made 150 dollars in a month off of these shrimp and I've bought more fish than I'm hopefully gonna raise and make money to keep up the hobby of basically you just keep selling and ask for store credit rather than the cash they're gonna give you way less cash so I've got 150 in store credit then you get you know start at your different stores you start buying expensive fish and that are easier to mate or get breeding and then those sell those for cash down the road so you're really kind of a three-tiered process to make money off of the breeding rather than that instant gratification of making fifteen to forty bucks here and there with you know your cold shrimp so I thought upon further inspection I have no idea what kind of shrimp that is it was probably blue where I wouldn't have put it in the tank but that is an oddball shrimp and I don't know where she came from but she's gonna go into the mixed tank because she may produce some weird offspring or some natural offspring and there is a also a big market for that in Seattle so if you like this if you're learning anything if you've enjoyed the channel the shrimp stuff or the crib stuff or the guppy stuff we've got lots of different things coming up and we'll have some interviews coming up don't forget to like subscribe share the videos and also if you want to keep this going and get more gear like microscopes like better camera equipment editing gear and caves and things like that so we can have more success with the breeding more breeder boxes so forth please check out the patreon link it means a lot because I've demonetized my YouTube in that I don't want you guys to have to watch a bunch of ads and at this point in time I am gonna try to get rid of the ads for you guys and those of you who can spare it if you want to help out on on patreon that's where you can do so otherwise it's just enjoy I totally get it if you can't spare the money right now but if this is bringing you happiness and entertainment and you're learning something it means a lot to me to get that support so thanks guys and I hope you're having a great day taking care of your fish taking care of yourself and keep on swimming we'll talk to you next time", "iRL-fgTb7f4": "good morning guys and welcome back to the channel and welcome to Suzuki in Worthing now all just picked up the keys here for the latest 20/20 version of the Suzuki Swift now this is a very very competitive segment of the market a commerce park just around the corner so we're going to go and have a look at it so here we go this is the 2020 version of the Suzuki Swift now one thing I need to clear up about this it is the generation 4 which is the latest version but it actually came out in 2016 and shares the same platform as the Ignace but what has changed over the past few months is the engine that's fitted to this we've got the traditional petrol up front but it is now got the addition of a mild hybrid system I'm not going to go into too much detail at the moment about what a mild hybrid system is but all you need to worry about it should give you better fuel consumption and ultimately save you a few more pounds in your pocket so we're going to hop into the car we're going to discuss what the Suzuki Swift has to offer we're talking about costs driving the overall experience of owning a swift because this is a very very competitive market and hopefully give you guys everything you need to know about the brand new Suzuki Swift fitted with a mild hybrid system welcome to the inside of the city he's Swift comfortable place to be but we'll explore this car together I've got it for the next couple of days and let's see how we get on so what it collects my phone first of all I've got an iPhone and luckily is standard this comes with both Android auto and apple carplay no extra whatsoever so that's fantastic this is the middle of the range model the S Z T so it doesn't actually come with the sat-nav you can use your fine for that I think loads of people and cleaning myself use wise or Google Maps so let's buckle up and take this out on the road and because they will explore this car together I'm not driven it not pokes around at all so it's all going to be a brand new learning experience and I think this is the ideal way really so get to know what a car is like and how intuitive it is so luckily it's a small car which is fantastic so nice and easy the drive and reverse got a parking reverse camera which comes on this model as standard which is again for a car of this size that is very very impressive and in terms of money let's get that bin out the way first of all this particular model the s Z T hybrid is twelve thousand five hundred and seventy pounds which is good value anyway but at the moment if you get yourself down to a Suzuki in worthy they're doing 20% off so that's the back on and also Suzuki while giving another thousand pounds off the price of the vehicle so this is starting to become a very very good proposition and this is before we've actually looked at it so I may be jumping to conclusions already I've got the figures down here so PCP put down one thousand four hundred and fifty three pounds I've no idea exactly why it's 1453 I'm a bit of a random number there and then you only pay a hundred and forty nine pounds a month 149 pounds is absolutely bargain in my eyes or and more manufacturers are bringing our hybrid versions of their cars and Suzuki have joined that group of manufacturers by creating this hybrid version of these as a he Swift so what exactly does this mean for you as a driver how do you use it and how does it work for you as a driver it improves your fuel efficiency so you're gonna get better mpg better mpg means less time at the petrol station and more money in your pocket to spend on something a bit more interesting how do you use it it sounds very technical well you don't do anything other than drive it's a very non intrusive system and you wouldn't know that you're using it or even have it fitted other than the hybrid badge on the back of the car and one of the options on the trip computer you can see which power source is being used so this well I can't say anything other than benefits from having this and it also decreases your co2 emissions which is even better better for the environment and also I think it will drop your tax right tax down so next how does this hybrid system work I find this absolutely fascinating sorry if you guys don't maybe skip forward about four minutes and you can not worry about how it works but I'll try and keep this as simple as possible probably because I don't know everything about but we've got two batteries fitted to this car we've got your standard LED battery up front and we've got an additional lithium ion battery which is used just to drive the electric motor fantastic Sahil does this actually work when are you using it when you come to a stop the engine also stopped as part of these stop-start technology fitted to the car now in a traditional car the starter motor would kick back in and for the engine again which again uses fuel this uses the electric motor to turn over the engine and get going it makes it quieter as well which is it's only a good thing after that when you pull away on your under acceleration both the petrol and electric motor are used so again under acceleration that is where the most fuel is going to be used so ultimately where we can have the biggest savings it's like great we've got this electric motor we've got this extra battery I'm saving money how do I go about charging this battery well it uses something called regenerative braking that means when you break or you Coast it turns the electric motor which in turn uses the kinetic energy to charge the battery so you have to do absolutely nothing there doesn't seem to be any downside of having a hybrid it's just a benefit saving money better for the environment it also makes the car drop over bit smoother it's not some clever tech going on as well to use both electric and petrol at certain times so I don't know why you wouldn't want a hybrid car it is just very very good it's very seamless and you just use it so that is what a hybrid system is all about what it means to you and how it works at last the way that has been kind to us the Sun has come out and we found somewhere to park up so we can have a look at the outside of this car so what's new about this Swift in terms of styling well overall it is a fun looking cult right at the front we've got a rather large Suzuki badge we've got the mesh type grille I think on some models you can have an aluminium trim running around it we've got daytime running lights and fog lights and one of the traits of this is Enki Swift is the windscreen it's a curved round so it just gives you it well from the front I just think quite a fun styling if we heard round the side we've got 16 inch Bridgestone alloys on this if you go for the flagship model you can upgrade those and they come with diamond cuts but even so like this I think they look rather nice we're start off this newest swage line that runs from the front headlight runs down the side through the door handle and wrapped itself around into the rear taillight we've also got this slight crease again runs from the front wheel arch goes through and into the rear wheel logic it just reeks it well just a bit nicer a bit less boxy the roof as well again this is a swift trait it's got an ever so slightly decreasing angle on there so it it just drops everything tight and just looks quite nice now door handles you may be wondering where have they gone they're actually up here they're in this black hair and it just gives it a more sleek look what this is actually gives you the option well the look is a floating roof liners they've called it and also it looks floating but it does look pretty good so let's hop in the back quickly we have a look at where passenger room so we'll open it up climb inside now I've left the seat where my passenger was sitting he's sort of six-foot and I've got plenty of room I mean in terms of headroom as well I've got a few inches above me I'm 6 foot yeah it's just quite comfortable we've got ISOFIX as well so it's great for a family we've got a small door bin which is a very small bottle of water in it this model comes with good old-fashioned manual winders for the window again next model up comes with electric yeah there's a lot going on in here but it is a relatively basic car that does everything you want so let's have a look around the rear of the car terms of styling it looks pretty cool we've got lots of creases and curves here and it makes it stand out quite a bit I think from some of its competition we've got a reversing camera just down just under here hybrid badge obviously as this well these are hybrid let's have a look in the boat the handle is under there if I can get it open we've got 265 liters of spice - tethering points here little hook here and light it doesn't actually come with a full sized spare tie it's got a foam puncture repair kit thing and also a pump you plug it plug it into your cigarette lighter and it'll pump the type so don't see outside of the Swift I don't know what you guys think do you like the look of it put in the comments down below so now we've had a look let's head on off and we'll keep having a discussion about various aspects of the car so let's have a chat about the tech in this car this is the mid-range model so the main thing to me is the infotainment system so we've got this screen over on the central - here it's all touchscreen now we've got a go back to the home screen so from there you've got four tiles you've got adab radio you've got a way of calling your phone a media and in this case at the moment I've got my iPhone connected so I've got all of the apple carplay features available to me this particular mid-range model doesn't come with sat-nav you have to go up I think to the next model in fact it's actually an optional extra so if you do want the sat-nav built-in you you can date so over on the steering wheel we've got a number of controls that can interact with the infotainment system we've got a way of picking up and putting down the phone and it also comes with speech recognition I know how to play around with this but if it's anything like the Vitara I reviewed I'll put a card just up here on that you could interact with the Sat Nav that was the main feature I'd use it for you could say oh I think there was a gear there somewhere oh yeah so you could say direct me to wherever that sort of thing I find incredibly good and a nice safety feature so you can say direct me to home or some sort of point of interest so what is this 20 20 swift got to offer me in terms of creature comforts well before we talk about that let's remember where this car is and where it sits the super mini segment is very very competitive so there are some compromises made in order to keep the price point down so what have we got we have a 12-volt power supply and exhilaration and a USB port where my phone is plugged into at the moment just under the air-conditioning unit there's something which is a bit strange is the cupholders we have two of those fantastic don't have a problem with that but this square one earth have they made square cupholders maybe it's something that I'm missing out on on life is square cups but I've not seen them before I do have a small thermos flask thing and that fits in very well it does warble slightly but as long as you're not flinging it around a racetrack that's not going anywhere you got to though so that's fantastic a couple of reasonable size door bins again let's see if that will fit yeah fits no problem at all in each side I've got a glove box not sure what to say about that really it's a god box reasonable size huge manual in there probably written in a million and one different languages but overall it it's functional it does everything that you could want no it doesn't have heated and cooled cupholders there are a few extra things I would have liked to see maybe some sort of central storage area but in terms of where it sits in price I think it is very very good we're heading onto the a 27 which is a dual carriageway and I think this will give us a good opportunity to experience the the road noise this little car has we're sitting on 16 inch wheels 1.2 litre engine with this small electric motor as well so let's see how well insulated it is I'm definitely expecting some road noise so I'm gonna be quiet we'll get up to speed I might need to drop it down so I put my foot down it's new performance car but I'm hoping once we get up to the speed limit it should be nice and comfortable so theory going accelerated and now we're at seventy miles an hour so I'm going to be quiet for a minute and you can see what the cabin noise is like there we go that's some silence for a minute well that's not bad at all the road noise isn't too loud it's certainly not silent but impressively this little 1.2 liter engine up front is doing a very very good job it's not screaming out sounding like it's in pain no we're off of the dual carriageway we've headed it into the town of Lewes now a car like this will probably spend an awful lot of time driving around the towns and cities is basically what this built for although it is perfectly happier doing longer journeys if we've just heard so let's see what it's like in terms of road noise so now terrified the clutch and it stopped completely and all you can hear is people outside it's a bit eerie this sort of thing so we'll wait for the lights to change this is when the electric motor kicks in starts the engine and helps when pulling away so let's say let's be quiet again and see what it's like at slice baits in terms of noise again that's that's pretty good it's getting very now I'm glad I'm in a small car people pulling out randomly uh-huh let's feel quite nimble this as well I mean we'll take it out and find some more exciting rides a bit later on and see whether one of the awards the best drivers car in the segment whether whether it deserve that this is Ricky Swift is supposed to be a fun light an agile car and we need to put this to the test well as much as we can on the public roads so I've headed out of town onto some my favorite back roads that are particularly tight and twisty and at the moment very muddy and very wet to try and see what the handling and the dynamics of this car are like and it might not be a particularly powerful sporty version of the car the sport I think is Darrell in the next month or so but it should still be a fun little car to drive so the suspension setup on this is sort of a in-between house it's firm enough to be fun but not a true sporty setup and at the moment I'm really pleased that these roads are particularly nasty there's very undulating huge potholes everywhere and having a slightly softer suspension set up is definitely beneficial but the thing I really like is it's such a smaller light color but it definitely feels like you're going quicker than you are that's something about a small car you can be pushing on and use 8/10 of the car and not actually be going anywhere near the speed limit these big and powerful performance cars you can probably drive a 1/10 than you've broken the law to be honest I'm I'm impressed too this it's riding these bumps really well this is possibly the steering I might want a bit heavier in town it's absolutely perfect on the back roads could do with a bit more weight behind it so the more and more I Drive this car the more impressed I am with it the handling on it is very good obviously on track you're gonna get a better idea but these back roads it's handled everything I was thrown at it I wouldn't want to be going any quicker I've been driving well well under the speed limit at times because you just can't go any quicker and it's just enjoyable you can feel everything that's going on the steering I think yes could be a bit heavier that would be quite nice but because it's a light car it just you can place it so much better there's not a huge amount of body roll either so I'm really looking forward to the sport when that comes out if it's this and dialed up to 11 now it is gonna be an absolutely brilliant car so what are my final thoughts on this Suzuki Swift I've got to say I'm very impressed with it considering this is a hundred and forty-nine pounds a month and you get a car that looks modern it drives well it's practical it's great for driving around towns it's nimble sdp it's just a great car there are some things which let it down but I do forgive it because of the price point it hasn't quite got as much technology that I'd want maybe the model above would be a better bet for you some of the plastics as well they do feel a bit cheap but it's a very well-put-together car so yes I'm saying this is a very good car just test drive it and make that decision for yourself I'm going to call this video to a close it's been a great couple of days I've had with Suzuki Swift and thank you to Suzuki in Worthing for allowing me to have the car if you have enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up any questions you might have please put in the comments down below and remember to click on the subscribe button thanks for watching", "dH70hsm-rh8": "[music] Logan: Hi, this is Logan for sleepopolis.com. Today I'm going to be reviewing the Lucid\nHybrid mattress. The Lucid is a company that makes a whole\nwide of different mattresses. I have previously reviewed the Lucid gel memory\nfoam, all-foam mattress. If you're looking for that review, you can\njust google Sleepopolis and Lucid mattress review. It'll pop right up. I also want to mention that the hybrid mattress\ndoes come in both 10 and 12 inch versions and uses either memory foam or latex foam\nin the construction. Today, I am going to be taking a look at the\n10-inch memory foam version of the hybrid mattress. I will have a little bit more information\non the other constructions in the written portion of the review which you can find at\nsleepopolis.com. I'm going to put the mattress through a few\ntests today and give some general recommendations at the end of the review. If you are interested in a personal recommendation\nor have any questions that I don't answer during the video, please feel free to leave\na note in the comments section below, with the information about yourself and some of\nyour sleep preferences. I'll be sure to get back to you. I'm going to start the review of the Lucid\nHybrid today with the construction portion. I'm going to start with the cover which is\na Tencel-blended knit cover. It's really thin. It's going to allow air to flow through for\nbreathability. Tencel is a cotton substitute. It's known for wicking with moisture, which\ncan help with temperature regulation and cooling. I'm going to look underneath the cover at\nthe layers of the mattress. The Lucid Hybrid mattress is a mixture of\ncoil and foam layers. The one I'm looking at today is the 10-inch\ntall-version although it also comes in a 12-inch version. This is the memory foam version of the Hybrid. Although, it also does come in a latex foam\nversion. The comfort layer on top here is an inch and\na half of bamboo charcoal memory foam. It's soft. It's going to let you to sink in for pressure\nrelief. It does have that slow response of pressure\nyou would expect out of a memory foam, which is going to give you a bit of that contouring\nfeeling. Memory foam can at times be known for trapping\na bit too much body heat. The bamboo charcoal infusion or mix in this\nlayer is supposed to help with that. Below that, we have a layer of foam that has\nan aloe vera infusion. Lucid says, ''That's going to help you wake\nup feeling more refreshed.'' Below that, a bit of a transition layer. Its high-density polyfoam separates these\ncomfort layers on top of the mattress from the support center of the mattress. I do want to make a note that I've cut into\nthe mattress to give you a better view of what's going on inside of it. Please do not do that to your mattress, just\ntake my word for it. The support center on the Lucid Hybrid is\nmade of a five and a half inch pocketed coil support system. It's going to give you some good bounce and\nsupport in the mattress. These coils are individually wrapped. They are going to be better at isolating motion\ntransfer than a traditional innerspring mattress would be. See how all those respond to pressure there. Wrapped around the entirety of the support\nlayer, is a high-density polyfoam edge support layer. This is a firm material. It reacts quickly to pressure. This is going to allow you to sleep all the\nway to the edges of the bed and make the bed feel a little bit bigger. At the base of the mattress, you just see\nan inch of high-density polyfoam. This really is just something for the support\ncenter of the mattress to press off of. [silence] Logan: Now that we've seen what makes up a\nLucid Hybrid, and some of an idea for the feel in the firmness of the mattress. I'll start by pressing into the cover. The first thing I feel is that soft memory\nfoam comfort layer. It's really allowed me to sink in pretty quickly\nfor pressure relief. A bit more pressure starts to interact with\nthe support center the mattress such as see some of the bounce from the pocketed coil\nsystem. I lie down on my back. Lying down on my back my weight is pretty\nevenly distributed. Not really pushing too far into the mattress\nand really only interacting with that soft layer on top, maybe a little bit of the transition\nlayer below that. I do feel myself sinking a little bit, a little\nbit of contouring and filling in the space below my back, which is nice. Even though there is a little bit of sinkage,\nI don't really feel stuck in the mattress, thanks to the mix with the pocketed coil support\nsystem, give me some bounce. I can change positions really easily. Turn around to my side. Side sleepers need to be extra conscious of\nincreased pressure. A higher weight concentration over a lower\nsurface area means you push further into a mattress. You tend to interact more with the support\nlayers of the mattress. Because of that, a lot of side sleepers will\ncomplain about pressure points forming at the shoulders and the hips as they deal with\nthe firmer portions of a mattress. A lot of side sleepers do like softer mattresses\nbecause they allow them to sink in further for more pressure relief. We are going to take a closer look at pressure\nlater on a review. I did just want to say, I find that this mattress\nhas a medium firmness, maybe on the softer side of medium firmness. I do feel pretty comfortable lying on my side\nin this position on the Lucid Hybrid. Roll on my stomach. Stomach sleepers are the opposite of side\nsleepers. They tend to prefer firmer mattresses because\nthey're going to keep their hips from sinking in, keep your spine aligned in a better position. Again, in my opinion, this has a medium to\nmedium or maybe soft little softer than a medium firmness. I feel like my hips are sinking too far into\nthis mattress. If you are a bit bigger than me and sleep\non your stomach, you might feel your hips sinking a bit too much into the mattress. Everyone can feel the firmness of the mattress\na little bit differently because of different sizes and weight distributions. For reference, I'm 5'10\" and 190 pounds. If you would like a wider variety of opinions\non the firmness of this mattress, a little more detailed description of the feel of it,\nyou can check out the written review on sleepopolis.com. Instead of just describing the feel of the\nLucid Hybrid to you I want to give you a visual representation where pressure points might\nform while lying on the mattress. To do that I placed this pressure map on top. I'm going to lie down on it. A few different positions, you see the results\nnext to me ranging from blue for low pressure to red for high pressure. I'm going to start on my back. Roll on my side. Try few positions here on my side. Finally, on my stomach. To give you a better idea of the bounce of\nthe Lucid Hybrid, I have this 10-pound steel ball. I'm dropping it here. There is a bit of bounce things that pocketed\ncoil support system really allows you to change positions really easily at a lower level. Not so much thanks to the memory foam, but\noverall pretty good bounce to this mattress over here. We're also going to run a quick motion transfer\ntest. Basically I'm going to drop this ball from\nheights of 4, 8, and 12 inches. If someone's rolling around in the middle\nof the night or getting into and out of bed. On the other side of the mattress I have a\nseismometer which is going to measure the disturbance that's transferred from one side\nof the bed to the other. The results you're going to see on screen\nnow show the disturbance levels you can expect when someone's moving around in bed in the\nmiddle of the night, something like that. In my opinion, the Lucid Hybrid does a pretty\ngood job of isolating motion transfer. Memory foam does a good job of dulling motion\ntransfer in the pocketed coil system because they're individually wrapped. Also does a good job of isolating motion. A lot of people buying a mattress are going\nto know they're going to feel like they're more on top of or sinking into the mattress. To test this, the sinkage test, in which we\nuse four balls of varying sizes, weights, and densities, simulate different body parts. Check to see how far into the mattress they\ngo. The six-pound medicine ball filled with sand,\nit's a lighter body part. 10-pound steel ball, it's the densest ball\nwe're using in this test. 50-pound medicine ball, it's also filled with\nsand, it's a heavier portion of your body. The 100-pound medicine ball filled with sand,\nif you're a bit bigger, kind of the center of your body which we expect sinkage there. In terms of sinkage, we have an inch for the\nsix-pound ball, two inches for the 10-pound ball, four inches for the 50-pound ball and\nsix inches for the 100-pound ball. When compared to other mattresses that have\ntested that is exactly average for all sinkages across the board. For what you expect that feels about right\nwith the construction of the mattress. There's a memory foam comfort layer you are\ngoing to sink in, feel a little bit sinkage there. It does mix well with the pocketed coil support\nsystem which gives them bounce. You definitely don't feel stuck in this mattress\nat all. You get this nice blend of sinking in for\npressure relief but without feeling stuck in the Lucid Hybrid. If you plan on sharing the bed with the partner,\nyou need to use the entire surface area of the mattress. Edge support can be incredibly important. Earlier that, Lucid took the time to add an\nedge support portion of the construction around the entire mattress to allow sleep closer\nto the edge. I'm really interested to see how that holds\nup here. I'm sleeping on the side of the Lucid here. It's a pretty even feeling over here from\nthe center of the mattress to the side. You can get really close to the edge, can\nsee that the high-density polyfoam wrapped around the support center of the mattress\ndoes a good job of supporting my weight. I don't feel like I'm going to collapse aside,\nroll out of bed. There is a little bit of compression through\nthose softer foams. That's to be expected out of softer layers\nlike that. As I'm hanging up the side of the mattress,\nrolling on to my side, again pressing through those softer layers on top the memory foams\non top. That's to be expected. What you're really looking at is the high-density\npolyfoam edge support portion of the mattress is doing a good job while I'm asleep, all\nthe way to the edge. As I sit up on the side of the mattress, concentrating\nmore of my weight over one portion of the mattress thing, maybe putting shoes in the\nmorning or something like that, I do push pretty far in. That's to be expected of a foam mattress. You're really concentrating your weight on\none side of the bed. Overall, I would say that the edge support\non the Lucid is pretty good. Just to give you some basic information about\nthe Lucid Hybrid there is a 10-year warranty, shipping is free. It will arrive compressed in a box. Who I recommend this mattress to? If you're looking for a value buy compared\nto other hybrid mattresses on the market, the Lucid Hybrid does come in on the less\nexpensive side. If you're looking for that hybrid feel but\ndon't want to pay such a high price, this would be a good choice for you. I also recommend the Lucid Hybrid to couples. As I was of impressed with how it did on the\nmotion transfer tests as well as the edge support test including the specific edge support\nportion of the construction, which allows you to sleep all the way to the edge of the\nbed. Those are two tests that I point to as being\nindicators for good mattress for couples. Finally, I reckon if it's a mattress we're\nlooking for that memory foam feel but don't want to feel stuck in the mattress, the comfort\nlayer is memory foam which has a slower response to pressure. It pairs well with the bounce from the pocketed\ncoil support system to enable to change positions easily without any added effort. Some general recommendation but if I'm going\nto be a bit more specific. Talk about some example sleepers, let's say\nyou're 220 pounds, you're strict stomach sleeper. I don't think I'd recommend this mattress\nto you as it is on that softer side of a medium firmness. Your hips might sink in a little bit, throw\nyour back out of alignment. However, if you're 160 pounds, you're a combo\nback and side sleeper, seems to be a good choice for you. Those are some really specific examples.

I'll be sure to get back to you. If your mattress search has just begun, please\nfeel free to google Sleepopolis and mattress buying guide. It's going to have a lot of information in\nthere.

[music]", "Kh5S82jW064": "Joe Auer: What's up everyone? My name is Joe. I'm from Mattress Clarity. Today, I'm going to be taking a look at the\nLucid 10\" Memory Foam Hybrid Mattress. I'm going to be telling you everything you\nneed to know about this mattress -- the pros, the cons, construction breakdown, who it's\na good fit for, who it's not a good fit for. Basically, by the end of the video, you're\ngoing to have a pretty good idea if you're going to want to get it, so stay tuned. [music] Joe: If you want to see a list of my favorite\nmattresses, simply Google Mattress Clarity best mattress. If you have any questions about today's review\nor any questions whatsoever, I do read and reply back to every comment on YouTube. Just leave a comment below, and I'll get back\nto you as soon as I can. We have the Lucid 10\" Memory Foam Hybrid Mattress. Lucid is a company that has a lot of different\nmodels that are very affordable. This is one of their more popular models,\nso I was excited to jump in and give it a try. Let's talk about what's inside the Lucid 10\"\nMemory Foam Hybrid Mattress. Starting with the cover here, nice soft cover. It's pretty thin, so it's not really going\nto affect the feel overall too much. Moving onto the mattress now, we have a memory\nfoam layer on top. It's infused with bamboo charcoal to make\nit sleep cooler. There's also some holes punched in here for\nextra breathability. Then we have another memory foam layer, then\na transition layer, and then steel coils. You're going to get lots of support and pressure\nrelief. You're going to get the pressure relief from\nthe memory foam layers on top here. See what that looks like. Pretty soft, it's going to conform pretty\nwell to the curves of your body. Then you've got very firm coils under there\nthat are going to support pretty heavy weights as well. You're going to have great pressure relief\nand support. It's going to be more breathable than your\naverage memory foam mattress, so it's a nice combination feel overall. Let's talk about firmness and feel. As far as firmness is concerned, I put this\nmattress at about a 6.5 out of 10, right about the middle of the mattresses that I've reviewed. Medium firmness there. The reason I feel that way is that you have\nsome pretty soft layers on top. I can push my hand in relatively easily. Then it gets pretty firm underneath that very\nquickly. When you combine that feeling, it's about\na 6.5 but right about average. As far as the feel is concerned, it is a hybrid\nmattress, but it's more of a memory foam feel than a springy, hybrid feel. I'll show you, there's no real bounce, whatsoever. This lacrosse ball just dies right there. This is going to be a quicksandy feel, slower\nmoving, memory foam feel. It's going to be a bit harder to move around,\nbut it does have pretty good pressure relief. That's the feel overall. Now, I'm going to talk through how I feel\nin different sleeping positions. Starting on my back, the first thing I notice\nis that my hips sink in but not too much. The memory foam conforms really well to the\ncurves of my body. It supports my lumbar area, but I don't sink\nin too far because of the coils. Great match for me there. Switching onto my side, I feel like there's\nvery good pressure relief for someone like me. If you're a light or medium weight sleeper,\nyou're really going to like this mattress on your side. If you're heavier, you may press through too\nfar to the comfort layers and feel a little bit more firmness. That's something to watch out for. Switching onto my stomach now, I would say\nit's a little bit too soft. My hips sink in a little bit too much. I would say if you're just a stomach sleeper,\nI would look for something a little bit firmer. At Mattress Clarity, we love our pressure\nmap testing. It shows you exactly how well every mattress\nrelieves pressure. I get down on the pressure map here. I lie down on my back, side, and stomach. You'll see anywhere from blue to no pressure\nall the way up to red to high pressure. The only thing to note is if you have a different\nbody type than I do, you might see different results. Let's get started. [music] Marten: Hey, guys. Marten here to offer a different perspective. Joe's 5'9\", 160. I'm 6'7\", 230. I'm a larger person. I want to give my experience with Lucid mattress\nhere. In terms of firmness, Joe said it was a 6.5\nout of 10. I thought it was closer to a 7 out of 10. It's because I am a larger person. I press further into the mattress. I feel more firmness than Joe did. In terms of sleeping positions, starting on\nmy back, I feel very, very nice. My hips sink in the right amount. Some decent lumbar support as well, so very\nnice for back sleeping. Moving to my side, I am feeling some pressure\nin my shoulders and my hips but not too much. I will say if you're larger than me -- I'm\n230 pounds, again -- if you're bigger than me, you might feel some more firmness in your\nshoulders and your hips. Moving to my stomach, I'm not feeling quite\nenough support. I am bowing at the hips. What does that mean? If you're a larger back sleeper, definitely\na good match. If you're a larger side sleeper, it might\nnot be soft enough for you. Larger stomach sleeper, definitely look elsewhere. Joe: If you sleep with a partner, you're going\nto want to consider motion transfer. Basically, if your partner is moving around\non that side of the bed, that motion is going to be isolated or transfer over to you and\npossibly wake you up at night. To test this, I have a glass here. I'm going to create a little disturbance around\nthe glass. You got memory foam on top here, so you can\nsee that the glass is not really moving that much. Great motion isolation here. I also had Marten on my team jump in and out\nof bed, create a little disturbance. I didn't really feel that motion transfer\nover to me, so I would say this mattress is a pretty good option for couples. If you sleep with a partner or you like sleeping\ntowards the edge of the bed, you're going to want to consider edge support. Basically, can you sit or sleep towards the\nedge of the bed without feeling like you're going to fall off. I'm on the edge here. The foam is collapsing quite a bit, so not\nthe best. I'm going to lie down on my back now. I'm getting a little bit of that rolling off\nthe bed feeling, so I would say the edge support is not the best in this case. I'm going to talk through some of the pros\nof this mattress or who this mattress may be a good fit for. This is a very good value. It resembles mattresses that should be more\nexpensive. With the price that it's at, very good value\noverall. It's also a good match of comfort and support. If that's something you're looking for, definitely\ntake a look at this mattress. It's great for side sleepers who are light\nor medium weight. You're going to get very good pressure relief. Then if you're a back sleeper or really of\nany weight, it's going to be very supportive for you. I'm going to talk through some of the cons\nof this mattress or who I think this mattress may not be the best fit for. Number one, if you're a stomach sleeper, I\nwould look for something a little bit firmer, a little bit more supportive. This is also a medium firm mattress. If you're looking for something that's a little\nbit firmer than average or something that's very firm, I would look elsewhere. If you're a heavier side sleeper, I would\nsay that you're going to press through the top comfort layers, feel a little bit more\nfirmness. I would look elsewhere in that case. If you sleep really hot, I would look for\nsomething else. To wrap up, a lot of people are going to like\nthis mattress. Light and medium weight side sleepers are\nreally going to like it. Back sleepers of really any type are really\ngoing to like it. It's also very good value overall. I would say if you're a stomach sleeper or\nwant something just a little bit firmer or you're a heavier side sleeper, I would look\nelsewhere. A lot of people are going to like this mattress. That's basically it. If you're just getting started with your mattress\nresearch, definitely check out mattressclarity.com.

even need rings one of my favorite I love it so I'm really excited to do this shop and honestly I've never had a melt before of an hand pack and what I hear is the melt is like a better quality I actually think that so I'll really Cruces people just like what it takes place when it smokes like consistency the way it looks we're gonna be reviewing all of that today so hang on it's like graduating and grab your guys grab whatever and get spoken of in this is the Moroccan melt [Music] okay it's smaller than blue drink oh nice it is pretty ashtray okay yeah that's cool the Middle East and the health of the world for evolution where it's a are I'm sorry I thought it was a backwards off it's actually a part store look at that smile it's delicious we got it now they don't mention what kind of micron is hashes but it looks pretty top-quality maybe it's so 45 or 75 who knows I really couldn't tell you just by looking at it oh it's awesome I love hash by the way that's one of my favorite things to smoke now when I was watching videos of melts I wasn't exactly sure what amount was but it looks like it's just regular hash so looks like it's not going to be anything that new or anything different but let's give it a shot let's get a nice little fat dab of it and see if we can get this going maybe gets get a little bit more there we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I was good [Music] now into the dam my initial reaction is possible if you have a man subdued I imagine a today that sparks but I always create a see a smaller do joined and the first upon trouble is take any type of clicking this like any kind of grand acres or chocobo and through any kind of these those terpene that it's definitely a lot more busy than you expect baby happy with them it's good good I mean I still went to ten I'm probably too good at seven concerning the how strong it is and it tastes if I was giving about a cake too many locations it's good for thirty bucks you really can't go wrong with this privatized and I really look forward to just having a nice pad for the cinnamon and hitting it two days I'm doing something she's probably my favorite thing about hash is just follow my advice and do a lot of this you get out of a single bowl of that it's pretty good yeah so in the come down you know it's not where you're sleeping I actually feel a little bit more little bit more creative to go out there and do something else which is strange because I always like to get more sleep you and more out and still decent more I can't release until got it baby I dig it I'm gonna probably sign off before your to star after the other pilot myself up another ball good time so anyway the girl over there I watched my video go ahead start up to doing just to smoking on a bond take it down hit it up and I'll catch you on the next video peace", "Q7HX3TBUTk8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

the iComfort hybrid line from Serta which is brand new for 2018 we're going to be showing you kind of the basic characteristics of this line as well as explaining what's new because it's been completely overhauled for 2018 and we're gonna be kind of explaining to you in more plain English terms what changes as you move up through this line this is also a good companion video to the iComfort video that we published in 2017 that line hasn't changed this line has been basically brought up to kind of match a lot what they did with the iComfort line in 2017 so stick around so in terms of how the iComfort hybrid compares to other hybrids are likely to see out there one thing you want to point out is that you'll see in the top couple inches of these mattresses that there's some quilting which gives it a little bit more of that traditional mattress look and that being said the the material used in the cover is actually sort of more of a stretch jersey like material that's more similar to what they use over in the iComfort non-hybrid mattresses the blue and the blue Maxx but but in general you're gonna get a little bit more that traditional mattress look and you're even going to see pillow tops and euro top type construction in the in icon for hybrid line whereas in other hybrid lines what you might see is just smooth tops with stretch covers that kind of go all the way across with no padding stitched into them and they might look more like a all foam mattress looks just from the top whereas these look a little bit more traditional in that respect but underneath all that you still do have these these premium comfort materials this memory foam gel memory foam which makes it a hybrid in terms of some of the features that the iComfort hybrid mattress is all have in common let's start with the coil unit because they all have the exact same coil unit which is a pocketed coil unit with 1008 pocketed coils and a foam encasement meaning a perimeter of firmer foam going all the way around those coils to give the match's a stronger edge in and the thing that's new about the pocketed coil unit in the 2018 hybrids is that they've introduced a new coil it doesn't represent all the coils used it's maybe like one out of five or something of the coils used in the mattress but it's a brand new design that basically combines three other pre-existing coil designs and combines them into one essentially it's on the bottom looks more like a traditional what they call Bonnell coil which is like a they call it like the tank of the mattress industry in terms of it's more of like a highly durable type of coil and it has an hourglass type shape then above that you have what more of just like a straight up barrel type shape that's very similar to a traditional pocket coil or for that matter what I come for hybrid is always used in the past and then up at the top is a couple layers of smaller diameter more tightly compressed loops that are basically more evocative of a micro coil provides a little bit more conforming it's the idea so they combine all three of those into one coil and then they intersperse or intermixed this type of newer coil in with the other pocketed coils in this in this mattress for a total of a thousand and eight coils in a queen size so so that's one aspect that all the iComfort hybrids have in common the other thing that all the iComfort hybrid mattresses have in common is the use of what they call a temp active gel memory foam which is a temperature activated memory foam they even have a temperature activated die just for a lust root of purposes mixed into this memory foam so you can see how it responds to just the heat from my hand for example but in general this is a memory foam that has the typical kind of delayed responsiveness that memory foam is known for and that's going to give the mattress a little bit more of that slow responding memory feel depending on how much of this material is used in the model you choose and it also will have the pressure relieving characteristics that go along with this type of material the other thing we wanted to point out is that the the iComfort non hybrids used a different approach to achieving the cooling feature with was that they used this this memory foam that they call temp active max that has phase change material right on the surface of it and that's not a material that's used in iComfort hybrid line and the thing we went under the reason we want to bring that up is just because this is a memory foam that compared to the non temp active max this this one that's used in the hybrid line is much slower responding you can see just how slow it is so to the extent that that's a feature that you really like you're going to find a lot more of that feature over in the upper end of the iComfort non hybrids the blue max than you will in any of the iComfort hybrids so the first thing we want to cover is just an introduction to what actually is a hybrid mattress and as some of you may know the way we think of a hybrid mattress is one that combines typically coil based support on the bottom half the mattress most typically a pocketed coils which is a type of coil that provides better motion isolation and better conforming properties than other types of coils with premium comfort materials in the top half the mattress in this case specifically memory foam or gel memory foam that provide better pressure relief and conforming properties so it really is kind of the fusion or hybrid of two different you know mattress construction techniques into one and that's where it gets its name in terms of how the iComfort hybrids are likely to differ from other hybrid mattresses that you may see out there one thing that we can point out is that the surface of these mattresses has more quilting than you're likely to see on a lot of hybrids a lot of hybrids when you just look at the top half it almost looks exactly like a traditional all foam type mattress construction with a stretch cover that you can lift up you know goes across the whole surface of the mattress a real smooth top this has that more familiar quilting on this on the surface although the fabric actually is sort of a stretch jersey type knit more similar to what they did on the iComfort blue and blue max lines in the all foam side the non hybrid side so it is even that is a bit of a hybrid but but the other thing you'll see in some of these models is even pillow tops and euro tops which again is something that you're more accustomed to seeing in traditional mattresses but but underneath all of that you're gonna find these premium comfort materials these memory foams that that do make it a hybrid so that's the overview of what the hybrid is in this case so in total there are 11 models in the new iComfort hybrid line and they start at $12.99 for a queen set meaning a mattress plus it's matching foundation and they go up to $29.99 for a queen set and you're gonna notice that the the names of these models tend to mirror the naming that they used over on the icon for non hybrid side so the entry-level models are gonna have names that involve the hundreds and the the sort of low to mid hundreds and then as you move up through the line you enter the thousands and the top of the line is gonna be the 5000 and and then within the line what you really find our differences in feel across two different dimensions specifically the amount of that slow responding memory feel depending on how much of that memory foam is in the model you choose as well as just the amount of softness and they actually vary up the softness in two different ways one way is at the top half the mattress the softness of the foams they use and the other way is actually the softness of the coils so they do have some differentiation in terms of like the actual softness of the coils used across the iComfort hybrid models in terms of how these models differ there it's mostly just 11 different fields and they tend to differ and feel across two different dimensions the first of which is to what degree does it have that slower responding memory field particularly at the top of the mattress and that's just going to depend on pretty much how much of that memory foam that we showed you is in the mattress and the second dimension where they different feel is on softness and they actually in this line did something somewhat unique which is they varied up with softness not only based on the softness of the phones they use in the top half of the mattress but also the softness of the coils that they use in the bottom half of the mattress so you will find a couple different combinations in this line some of which achieve softness more through the foams and some of which achieve them more through the coils or some through both so now we're just going to show you some of the actual models in this line to give you a sense of how they differ we're starting here at the bottom of the line or the entry level with the blue fusion 100 and the blue fusion 200 this is being affirm and this being a plush they're twelve ninety nine and thirteen ninety nine in a queen set respectively and basically these two models have the least amount of that memory foam in the iComfort hybrid line so you can notice that they really although they different seal this one on my on this side being a lot plusher neither of them has a whole lot of that slow responding memory field just due to the amount of memory foam in them so you're gonna get in either case more of that you know bouncy traditional feel on these two than you will as you move up through the line so now we've moved up to the blue fusion 1000 which actually has three different comfort options all at the same price point of $19.99 for a queen set it's got the luxury firm the luxury firm pillow top and it also has a plush pillow top and all of these have definitely more memory foam than when we last showed you that you're up to a couple inches or so of memory foam and these you're definitely going to get a lot more noticeable slow responding memory feel to them and they've also added something that everything from the 1000 level and up has from a cooling perspective that's new which is which is phase-change material in the cover so that's that's additive to the other cooling properties of these mattresses and you can definitely feel it it has a coolness to the touch that you can certainly feel I can even feel it like through my shirt if I lay back on the mattress so that's something that if if heat is an important issue for you these these models from a thousand and up are gonna have that feature so now here we are on the top of the line in the Serta iComfort hybrid collection which they call the blue fusion 5000 cushion firm pillowtop now this is the model that has the most of that memory foam that we showed you earlier it has a lot of cushioning depth this is a thick mattress it's probably about 16 inches thick or so we probably wouldn't give this the title of softest in the iComfort hybrid line we probably give that title to the fourth the blue fusion 4000 by a nose but overall this is definitely a very plush feel with a lot of cushioning depth and a lot of that slow responding memory feel so we hope you found this to be a helpful overview of the new eye confort hybrid line for 2018 for more helpful information on how to choose the right mattress for you go to good bed comm in the meantime thanks for watching and we really hope you sleep well [Music]", "NT_Hh_ldOSc": "how you doing well Presidents Day sales on mattresses you went you looked around and not only did you maybe not find what you were looking for but when you did

but there is one person is how new this is one person in America currently sleeping on this bed it is you it is no first testimonial call comes from Melinda from Pennsylvania guess what I have to tell you I am so thrilled we wanted to do something different for 2020 and this is what we redesigned had a lot of things in here that I wanted but I love sleeping on it because it just meets all of my needs I'm gonna talk to you about that first the first and foremost again if you're shopping right now this is not an all foam mattress at that price this $1300 bed is literally a hybrid mattress and then a very important component because a hybrid mattress is a combination it's a combination of layers and here come those layers right now before we even dive into this okay there is a there's literally the foundation any foundation use then there's a coil construction but take us through this Linda would you okay so first of all what you're looking right here that is the mattress you've got that base foam on the bottom where you see those blue coils that is your quantum coil then you're going to have a transition layer then you have that beautiful serene convoluted foam which we're going to talk to you about that and then you've actually had that quilted on top and it's got that live smart I can't wait to tell you all the things you've got the edge right there I caught the green man sitting on the edge by the way it is because you're not going to roll off it's gonna keep you sitting very very comfortably and then you're laying down you know what that guy's got lumbar support we added a lot more support to this one which is so important to me because I have a bad back and you can see how because it's a hybrid you don't have to worry about heat it dissipates through the coils and also through the serene dissipates heat we're saying and what look at this what if you spill something on that bed well because it's live smart you don't have to worry about it it's water resistant and also stain resistance is literally a brand new formulation a brand new bed taking our most popular bed from 2019 and stepping it up in a big big way take a look at this and now clarify should we go through this is what these layers okay I'd love to because let's make a bed right here this is what you're looking at this is that base foam which you saw in that previous on picture there right now comes the baby here what is improved here this is that quanties onde quantum coil spring unit and you're seeing the blue here that's that quantum edge there where you saw the guy the green guy sitting on the edge so you're not falling off but what we've done in here we've added lumbar support one third of the bed has springs in it that's going to take care of you the quantum coils of your lumbar that's really really important for people there are 789 of them in the game they are thicker yeah are stronger they I are better made more support okay that is the improvement and guess what it's still under six hundred dollars for the king here comes the right and I want to show you that they're wrapped this autumn a tie one of the thing this helps with transference if you've got somebody getting out of bed and also support that's very very important then you've got the transition layer this is how we build this bed great then you've got this this is this is my love so now this is a big deal everybody you're watching right now Google and frugal this is a huge story people looking for a bit it's called serene serene so memory foam has been the gold standard forever but we now have the Platinum standard if you will it's called serene it's correct looted serene and there is so much happening if you Google and frugal how expensive serene can be because of what it does it is is it more supportive it is more supportive is it less temperature sensitive to memory foam absolutely does it dissipate heat faster yes it does you know why cuz it's an open-cell construction and it dissipates heat but that means you're not going to be sleeping hot like you do it your memory foam this is a game changer and that's why people are paying thirteen twelve and thirteen hundred dollars for these beds this is now in our brand-new bed you will love this and we're not done yet I want to just show you one other thing you know how traditional memory foam when you push down and it stays down I want you to see the recovery here and this is five zones that are going throughout the base of the bed here so we're targeting all those area for pressure relief points we didn't stop okay here's that we've got the wonderful gel foam here but this is stain resistant you're looking at live smart which the fabric we did here it's nice it's soft I don't want you to think that we took care of something for the make it water-resistant same reason and it's not gonna be soft its soft its comfortable but what happens is you're not gonna have to worry about life getting on your mattress

just get doesn't it feel wonderful so you can see Annalise is laying down I'm going to show you why this is so good for your body it's coming up and it's coming up the back of your heel here it's coming up here she's not sinking down at all she's totally flat it's coming up and getting her calf coming up under her knee really I'm just having to put my hand under here for her hips and thighs pressure reducing remember that if you've got pressure points you don't have to worry about it the lumbar support underneath too small your back I have four children and this is where I carry all of my stress and underneath his shoulders and underneath the next she's not even laying on a pillow so if you want to turn away from me and then I'll be able to show so for the side sleepers out you say Melinda can one mattress take care of side sleepers and back sleepers absolutely because the way we designed it with all the bells and whistles so once again it's cupping underneath here now you've got under the calves now you've got both knees on top of each other which is very very important you've doubled the weight so you've got the top it's coming up and grabbing you here underneath the hips and thighs underneath the smaller back I can't point up enough how she's not sinking and the bed is coming up and reaching her which is very important you want a combination of softness and support yes that's what you're getting here so it's the serene which is that stepped up from traditional memory foam and then the new quantum coil construction within it that's giving you lumbar support giving you edge support and by the way you can use this on any kind of bed including an adjustable best so he doesn't even know this you ready so put this pillow under your head and so we wanted to", "-uGmq3deiC8": "uh um so my so hmm um so so so so so hmm my do so so so so so foreign so foreign um so my um so so so hmm foreign so so so so so so so you hmm so so foreign um so so so you", "tWC1Nm7FHjs": "what's up everybody I'm Logan from sleep apple\u00eds and today I'll be reviewing the lucid hybrid mattress now throughout the video I'm gonna run some tests talk about what the mattress feels like what it's made of and finally give my pros and cons but if there's anything I don't cover during the review leave a comment below also be sure to check out the full written mattress review at Sleep apple\u00eds comm you can find it under the mattress reviews drop-down at the top of the screen while you're there you're also gonna find up-to-date pricing information and exclusive coupons so I do really recommend you go and check out the website right now let's jump in and talk about what the Lucid hybrid feels like now when talking about what a mattress feels like the first thing I like to bring up is the support level or firmness of the bed on this lucid memory foam hybrid mattress I gave it a medium firmness so in that six and a half to seven out of 10 range it's a really nice mix of support and pressure relief in multiple positions when I was lying on my back and I weights evenly distributed it and because the comfort layer is memory foam I do feel myself sink into the mattress just a little bit you're gonna get that nice contouring around your body that memory foam is known for I still think there's enough support here to keep my hips from sinking too far in the mattress while I'm lying on my back keep my spine aligned in a good position that's really important for the back sleepers out there now rolling around at changing positions in memory foam can at times be a little bit slow because of its slow response of pressure but the pocketed coils support layer here gives this mattress some pretty good bounce for a memory foam mattress so I think there's pretty good mobility I didn't feel stuck in the mattress at all when I was rolling for my back to my side or anything like that which is a nice plus for the Lucid hybrid here now rolling onto my side what I'm really worried about here is what are my hips and my shoulders doing if you're a side sleeper that's on a mattress that's too firm for you're gonna feel jammed up in the shoulder area you might have some pressure points form at the hips we're gonna take a closer look at pressure later on in the review but I do have to say I found that the Lucid hybrid the lucid memory foam hybrid that I'm on is actually pretty comfortable for side sleepers if you're a super strict side sleeper that wants a super plush feeling mattress this might not be the best choice for you but if you're someone who kind of switches from your back to your side throughout the night I think you're gonna be okay here on the Lucid hybrid now rolling onto my stomach what I really want is a firm support especially in the hips so that they don't sink too far in the mattress keep my spine aligned in a good position now with the Lucid hybrid here it is in that medium if you do roll on your stomach for a small portion of the night I think you're gonna be okay if you're a combo sleeper changing positions quite a bit this is a good choice however if you are a strict stomach sleeper I think the memory foam over time is just going to kind of allow your hips to sink too far into the mattress in this position I generally do not recommend memory foam mattresses to stomach sleepers in general so again if you're a back sleeper great choice if you spend a little bit of time on your side again I think this is a really nice choice stomach sleeper is if it's only a portion of the night probably gonna be okay but if you're a stripped stomach sleeper I think it's just a little bit too soft now to give you a better idea of what's going on with the Lucid hybrid I've peeled back the cover so you can see the materials used in the layers of it now first up starting with that cover it is a polyester knit pretty thin it's got a pretty durable feel to it but otherwise it's pretty normal for a standard Bend abox mattress now underneath that we have the comfort layer of memory foam this mattress does come in a latex version but the one I'm testing out today has a memory foam comfort layer so that's gonna have that slow response to pressure you can see that there that slow response is what's gonna give you that kind of sinking in that contouring glove feeling around your body when you're lying on a memory foam mattress one thing I will say is that memory foam can be known for trapping a bit of body heat so if you are someone that has trouble with that generally you overheat during the middle the night you might want to look for a memory foam with a gel infusion or open celled structure or something like that now below that we have a layer of polymer or polyurethane foam it's got that quicker responsive pressure this layer here is actually pretty soft so you will be able to sink even further in for some nice pressure relief but it has a quicker response to pressure so you're not gonna feel stuck in this layer of the mattress and below that we have another layer of polyurethane foam it's a bit firmer than the one above it basically that's giving you some transitional support so as you're moving through from the softer memory foam this soft poly foam firmer poly foam into the pocketed coils here now the pocketed coils give you that traditional inner spring feel of a mattress some really good bounce and support you can see that there one thing I will say is that because these are pocket coils they are individually wrapped so they move a bit more independently than those old steel clothes might be used to which is going to help it with motion transfer now you might notice that wrapped around the coils is a layer of polyurethane foam it's pre firm and that's gonna be the edge support of the mattress I think that this mattress actually has some pretty good edge support so you can use the entire surface of the bed sleep all the way to the end without worrying about collapsing the side now instead of just taking my word on the feel of a mattress like to run a few tests on all the beds that I review here in the first test is a pressure map test basically I put a pressure map down on top of the mattress lie down in a few positions and you'll see the results next so you're aging from blue for low pressure to red for high pressure now my back again my weights evenly distributes blue across the board if that's what I was expecting you will feel yourself sinking into the mattress just a little bit because this is a memory foam bed so you're gonna get some that nice contouring but again low pressure I think this is a good choice for the back sleepers out there now rolling onto my side this is really the most interesting portion of the pressure nap test because with the firmer mattresses we can see these shoulders and hips spike into the yellow or even red range for really high pressure that's gonna be a bad sign for a mattress or side sleepers here on the Lucid hybrid you can see it's blue mostly across the board there is a little bit of green at the hips but I think that green is still in the acceptable range if you are a side sleeper especially the one that spends your time switching between your back to your side I think this lucid hybrid is going to be a good choice because of that low pressure now finally rolling onto my stomach again it's low pressure but that's gonna be mostly because my weights even distributed I think this is a little misleading for the stomach sleepers out there I did feel my hips sink into the mattress just a little bit if you are a stomach sleeper around a memory foam mattress the longer you're on the bed the more your hips are going to sink in throwing your back out of alignment now another test that I like to run is a bounce test basically to check to see how much mobility a mattress provides especially with materials like memory foam that have a slow response to pressure you know are you going to feel stuck in the mattress as layers while you're trying to change position because of the memory foam on top it is a little bit slow responding but I do think that the pocketed coil support does a really good job of providing some bounce to the Lucid hybrid I didn't feel stuck when I was changing positions rolling for my back to side or anything like that so I do think that the Lucid hybrid does have some pretty good mobility for the combo sleepers out there now another test that I like to run that kind of goes hand-in-hand with the bounce test is a motion transfer test basically if you share your mattress with a partner are you going to feel it on your side of the bed when they start changing during the middle of the night if they get up to go to the bathroom get into bed a little later than you that kind of a thing how I test that is I put a seismometer down where you might be sleeping and on the other side of the bed I drop a 10-pound steel ball from heights of four eight and twelve inches and that seismometer is going to check to see how much disturbances transferred with each of those drops now in terms of the Lucid hybrid I actually think the lower drops those four and eight inch drops performed very well in terms of isolating that motion transfer the twelve inch drop kind of average overall I would say if you share your bed with a restless sleeper the Lucid hybrid is going to do a pretty good job of tamping down on the disturbance that you feel on your side of the bed you know if you do have a pet or some kids that like to jump into bed in the morning with you you will feel it on your set of mattress but there's really not much that we can do there now finally the last test that I like to check is edge support basically are you going to be able to sleep all the way to the end of the bed without collapsing it makes the bed feel a little bit bigger if the mattress has a really strong edge it's a really good sign for the couples for a mattress for the couples out there I was actually really impressed with the edge support here on the Lucid hybrid a lot of benda box mattresses kind of are a little bit weaker on the side of the bed will start to collapse just a little bit but I think that the Lucid hybrid performed very well on this portion of the review now if you're watching this review I'm sure the lucid hybrid isn't the only mattress that you're checking out online so I want to compare it against some of its biggest competitors first up is the tuft and needle mattress now the tough needle is an all foam benda box it has a straightforward no frills two layer design to it it's actually a bit firmer than I was expecting it to be when I tested it out did a really good job of keep my hips from singing to the mattress while still providing some really nice pressure relief just like the Lucid hybrid I do really like the tough needle for the back sleepers out there I will say that I found that the tough needle sleeps a little bit cooler than the Lucid hybrid that we're looking at today however it is a bit more expensive overall next up is the lucid versus Casper mattress now the Casper all foam bed is one of the most popular mattresses online however it also comes in a hybrid version much like the lucid we're looking at today that's that mixture of foam and coil layers and regardless of whether you go with the all foam or hybrid Casper it uses a zone support system so that's gonna be a bit softer at the shoulders while adding a little bit more support the hips that's really nice for side sleeping spinal alignment I actually found that the Casper hybrid version is a bit softer than the all foam Casper I really like the Casper hybrid for the backside combo sleepers a lot like the lucid hybrid today but one of the biggest differences is that the all foam Casper and Casper hybrid are both significantly more expensive than he lucid hybrid that's just a little bit of information on the tuft needle and Casper mattresses and how they stack up against the lucid hybrid but if you want the full reviews up-to-date pricing information and exclusive coupons head over to sleep Papa's calm before I end the review I do want to give you my pros and cons for the lucid hybrid mattress first up reasons I would recommend it to you include if you are a back sleeper I thought that the medium firmness did a really good job of supporting my hips keep my spine aligned in a good position while still allowing me to sink in just a little bit for that nice pressure relief from the memory foam comfort layer of the mattress I'd also say that I was really impressed with the edge support of the lucid hydrator you know that's not always the case with a been the Box mattresses but I think if you want to use the entire surface of the mattress sleep all the way to the end of the bed you're not gonna have to worry about collapsing it rolling out of bed in the middle of night or anything like that I also got to say finally that this is one of the best values out there for the quality mattress that you're getting with the lucid hybrid it is one of the more affordable mattresses on the market now I do really like the lucid hybrid but I don't think it's the perfect mattress for everybody so some of my biggest complaints with the lucid mattress include that I think it sleeps just a little bit hot you know with memory foam mattresses that can often be a problem because it does have a tendency to trap a bit of body heat causing you to overheat during the middle of the night and also I got to say I just don't think it's a great choice for these strict stomach sleepers out there that has more to do with just memory foam in general if you are a stomach sleeper you're gonna want to find something with firmer support now if you are interested in purchasing a lucid mattress I wanna give you some of their company policies first up there is a 100 night trial periods to get of it in your home for just over three months standing where they want to keep it or send it back shipping and returns are free it will arrive compressed in a box you're gonna wanna decompress for a few hours or even overnight before you sleep on it so you have the full support and feel of the mattress I should also point out that it is available on Amazon so you can use your Amazon Prime account if you would like and also there is a 10 year warranty on the Lucid mattress that we looked at today which is about the average online benda Box warranty out there now lucid is one of the more popular mattress brands online so we get a lot of questions about them here at Sleep oppelo so answer few of the more frequently asked questions we get about lucid that aren't covered by our standard review process here now the first one up is our lucid mattresses toxic and may actually get that question about a lot of online been to Box mattresses all foam mattresses things of that nature lucid mattresses are not toxic they actually use Serta pure certified foams you can check out what that means more on their website if you do get a little bit of a smell off of the Lucent mattresses when you first open it up that it's called off-gassing it is really common you know if you leave it open for a little while and actually open up the windows you can really help to dissipate that smell now the next frequently asked question is can I sleep on a lucid mattress before 48 hours have passed and the answer is yes I generally recommend with any bed in a box mattress that you give it 24 hours so basically overnight before you sleep on it if you can it will continue to expand for 2 or 3 days but it generally has enough support and pressure relief after about a night and last but not least is a question that we get a lot for benda box mattresses of all kinds is can I flip a lucid mattress and the answer is no because of the way that this mattress is set up the firmer support layers are on the bottom with these softer pressure leaving that memory foam layers are on top if you flip the mattress it will mean that you're just sleeping on a support base if you are worried about wearing out your lucid mattress because of kind of wearing divots into it or something like that I would recommend rotating the bed 180 degrees every six months so that's it for my review of the elusive

I'm Logan from Sleepopolis.com. Today I'll be comparing the Nectar and DreamCloud\nmattresses. I'll give you their similarities, their differences,\nand who I think would benefit from going with one over the other. Stick around to find out if you should buy\nthe Nectar or DreamCloud mattress. [music] Logan: The first way I'm going to differentiate\nbetween the Nectar and DreamCloud mattresses is by showing you the differences and the\nmaterials used in the layers of them. I'm going to start with the Nectar. The Nectar is an all-foam bed-in-a-box mattress. The cover is made of cotton and tensile blend. Below the cover, we get to the comfort layer\nof the mattress which is three inches of memory foam. Below that, we have this contouring layer\nof the mattress, which is another two inches of memory foam. With five inches of memory foam on top of\nthe Nectar, you're going to be able to sink really deep into the mattress. You're going to get that classic memory-foam\nfeel, that contouring around your body. It's going to have that slow response to pressure,\nso there's not going to be a lot of bounce on the Nectar, but you will feel the sink\nin for some nice pressure relief. Below that, you have six inches of high-density\npoly foam, which is the support center of the mattress. It's a really common layer in a lot of all-foam,\nbed-in-a-box mattresses because it's got this firm feel to it. It does a good job of supporting that soft\nmemory foam on top of it and also giving shape to the Nectar itself. Next up, I want to talk about the materials\nin the DreamCloud mattress, which is also a bed-in-a-box. It's a little bit different from the Nectar\nin that it is a hybrid construction, which means it uses a mixture of foam and coil layers,\nwhereas the Nectar was all foam. The top of the mattress has the cover, which\nis a cashmere and polyester blend. There is a foam pillow top on top of the DreamCloud. Just like the Nectar, it uses softer foams\non top to allow you to sink in for pressure relief. The difference comes below that pillow top. Where the Nectar used high-density poly foam\nfor support, the DreamCloud is actually using pocketed coils. Those pocketed coils are going give you more\nof a traditional feel to the mattress, some good bounce and mobility, whereas on the Nectar,\nyou're going to feel a little more sunken into the mattress. The DreamCloud, you're going to feel more\non top. You're going to be able to change positions. It's going to have a little bit of a firmer\nfeel to it. Something that's nice about the DreamCloud\nis that wrapped around the entirety of the pocketed coil support is a high-density poly\nfoam edge-support layer. This is really just around the edge of the\nmattress. It's going to give you a little bit of extra\nsupport on either side so you don't collapse a side when you roll over towards the ends\nof the bed, help you feel a little bit more secure at the ends of the bed. I think it's a really nice touch for couples. Of course, the thing you're going to want\nto know most about when talking about a new mattress is what it feels like to lie in bed. I wanted to give you a little bit of the differences\nbetween the Nectar and DreamCloud when it comes to firmness and feel. First up, the Nectar mattress, which, in my\nopinion, comes in at a 6 out of 10 on the firmest scale, 10 being the firmest. That puts it right in the medium range. Some of my other testers here at Sleepopolis\nfind it to be just a little bit firmer. It averages out to a 6.5 out of 10. That's pretty much right in that medium range,\nthat nice mix of support and pressure relief. Again, it has a lot of memory foam on top\nof the mattress, so you are going to sink into the mattress a little bit. Even when I was lying on my back with my weight\nevenly distributed, I could feel myself start to sink into the mattress. You feel that contouring hug around the mattress. As you're changing positions, rolling around\non the mattress, because of that slow response from memory foam, there's not a lot of bounce\nto it. You may feel a little bit stuck in the Nectar. There's definitely more of and in-the-mattress\nfeel than on top of it. As I changed onto my side, side sleepers are\ngoing to really like the memory foam feel and being able to sink into the mattress. That's because it really helps with pressure\nrelief. I think the Nectar is great for pressure relief. Side sleepers are especially conscious of\nthis fact because they have a higher weight concentration over a low surface area, so\nthey end up pushing further into a mattress. If you bump up against a firmer section of\nthe mattress, that can cause you to get jammed up at the shoulders, cause you to have some\npressure points at the shoulders, the hips, things like that. In general, I really like the Nectar for side\nsleepers. Rolling onto my stomach, what I'm really wanting\nto be conscious of is what my hips are doing in this situation. I think the Nectar is not the best choice\nfor stomach sleepers because of that same thing of allowing you to sink into that five\ninches of memory foam on top of the mattress. If you are a stomach sleeper, you're going\nto want to have your hips aligned so that your back is aligned in a good position. For me, personally, I found that my hips were\nsinking into the Nectar, sending my back out of alignment a little bit. While I do really like the pressure relieving\nbenefits of the Nectar for side sleepers, I don't think it's the best choice for stomach\nsleepers. Next up, the DreamCloud Mattress, which in\nmy opinion has that 6.5 to 7 out of 10 range on the firmest scale, so a little bit firmer\nthan the Nectar overall. It's still in that medium to medium-firm range. Combo sleepers I think are going to be pretty\nhappy on the DreamCloud. The difference in construction makes it feel\na bit more like a traditional innerspring mattress with those pocketed coils, and the\nnice pillowtop foams for the mixture of support and pressure relief. When I was lying on my back, there is a little\nbit of sinkage into those softer foams, but I definitely felt more on top of the DreamCloud\nthan sunken into it. The cover of the mattress is tufted so it\nhas a little bit more tightness to it. You feel like you're able to change positions\na little bit easier, less of a stuck feeling like in that slow-moving memory foam on the\nNectar. You're able to have a little bit more mobility\non the DreamCloud. Rolling onto my side, it is that medium range\non the firmest scale. I think most combo sleepers are going to be\nOK here. Even though it is a little bit firmer than\nthe Nectar, I think if you spend your night rolling around, changing positions from your\nback to your side, you'd be OK on the DreamCloud. I think strict side sleepers are probably\ngoing to prefer the Nectar, but it's not a bad choice for combination sleepers. Rolling onto my stomach, I did feel that this\nmattress is a little bit firmer. Like I talked about, it kept my hips from\nsinking of the mattress, kept my spine aligned in a better position. If you are a strict stomach sleeper, I think\nthe DreamCloud would be a better choice than the Nectar because it did a good job -- keep\nmy hips from sinking in the mattress, keep my spine align in a good position. [music] Logan: It's time for recommendations. Who should buy the Nectar? Who should buy the DreamCloud? We're going to start with the Nectar. I think that the Nectar is a better choice\nfor the side sleepers out there. Like I mentioned a couple of times, there's\nfive inches of memory foam on top of the Nectar. You're going to be able to sink deep into\nthe bed. It's really going to help you with pressure\nrelief. Side sleepers have to pay attention to that\nso they don't bump up against firmer layers that can cause them to feel jammed up at the\nshoulders or the hips, cause pressure points to form in those locations. Because of the really nice pressure relief\nof the five inches of memory foam on top, I think the Nectar is a better choice for\nthe side sleepers out there. Also, it's simple, but if you love the feel\nof memory foam, the Nectar is the choice for you. If you really like that feel of sinking into\nbed that contouring hug around your body, the Nectar is going to allow you to do that,\ngive you that feeling. Even if you are a back sleeper, you should\nfeel like you're sinking into bed a little bit, get that nice pressure relief there as\nwell. If you're a side sleeper, and you love the\nfeel of memory foam, the Nectar is going to be the choice. For the DreamCloud mattress, I think it's\na better choice if you're looking for firmer support. It has the pocketed coil support layer below. It gives some nice bounce, does a nice job\nof keeping your hips from sinking into the mattress. This is especially nice for back or stomach\ncombo sleepers because it's going to help keep your spine aligned in a good position\nwhile you're in those positions. I also think that the DreamCloud is a better\nchoice for the couples out there. If you sleep with a partner, you know how\nimportant it is to have the most space possible on the bed. The edge support portion of the DreamCloud\nmattress allows you to sleep all the way to the ends of the bed without worrying about\ncollapsing it. It makes the bed feel a little bit bigger. Another big plus about the DreamCloud that\nI found while doing my full review of the mattress is that it does a pretty good job\nof isolating motion transfer. That means, if you have a restless partner,\nit's going to do a better job of dulling that disturbance down as they roll around in the\nmiddle of the night or get into and out of bed. For the DreamCloud mattress, I recommend it\nto those people who want firmer support and for those that sleep with a partner. [background music] Logan: I've talked about the materials used,\nthe feel of the mattresses, my recommendations for each of them. I want to give you a little bit more purchasing\ninformation on both the Nectar and DreamCloud mattresses. First up, the trial period. They both have a year-long trial so you can\nhave them into your home up to a year deciding whether or not they're the right mattress\nfor you. In terms of a warranty, they both have lifetime\nlimited warranties. You'll want to check out exactly what those\npolicies cover on the website, but those are pretty impressive warranties for the bed-in-a-box\nmarket. In terms of shipping, they're both bed-in-a-box\nmattresses and they both ship for free. The difference in price is actually pretty\nsubstantial. The Nectar mattress is much less expensive\nwith the price range going from $399 to $899 depending on the size you buy. The DreamCloud mattress ranges from $899 up\nto $1,399. That's it for my comparison of the Nectar\nand DreamCloud mattresses. If there's anything I didn't cover, just leave\na comment below.

once again a long time no see Joey Murdock I know my last video was also on this type of thing and if you guys don't like these type of videos I am so sorry please let me know if you wanted to make a second channel about this type of stuff I personally don't want to because this is what I love but if it bothers my regular subscribers so much then I'll go ahead and move over if not we're all Gucci it definitely wanted to film this video because in this subject it may seem to you if you're experienced and then set this up like girl we already know this but you would be surprised all the different dispensaries I've been to so far all of the different medical marijuana patients that I have interacted with before may not even know this stuff and so that's why I really want to start making these type of videos to just educate people more on marijuana its benefits and the good things about it because you probably only hear like weed is so bad for you it's a drug and it's a plant that grows from the ground and it's not for everyone but it is an amazing miracle plant and I am so so so so so happy that I am able to access it here in my state especially let's start off with the plants themselves and we're gonna speak a little bit about that first so sativa plants we're gonna speak about those first so tebow you can think of as more of a daytime plant do they grow taller up to 18 feet you definitely have thinner leaves and they're gonna be more narrow sativas usually have longer flowering cycle they grow in warmer climates and longer seasons they like to reach for the stars as I say and grow kind of up and out the buds are gonna be not so close to the stalk now speaking on indica plan Anika plants are gonna be shorter they grow between 2 to 6 feet opposite to the sativa plant the leaves are thicker brush ear and broader as well as the buds growing closer to the stalk of the plant can think of indica leaves as being like fatter wide and sativa is during the day she's a little more active so she's a little skinnier hybrid plants they're gonna be a mix because we'll get into why but hybrid plants are a mix of the two so I can't really tell you if a hybrid plant is gonna be super tall or super bushy or like in between you know what I mean the flowering time with hybrid plants very it's not something that you can indicate like sativas and indicas plans it's a very time when I put the plant I know if you're patient you don't really ever see plan especially here in Florida we can grow them what you are here 40 types of cannabis sativa indica and hybrid domain major types are indica and sativa now sativas are definitely for daytime use more than night 100 percent a lot of people use sativas during the day and then because during the night so sativa they're usually used for daytime use I like to describe sativas as being more of a head highs more in your brain than you feel it in your body so sativas are known for being like more of a psychoactive type of strain but they're definitely uplifting euphoric they provide lots of creativity's they give you energy they're uplifting make you more alert and they're also very stimulating which is why they're associated with being for the daytime because you don't want to get sleepy you want to be able to do what you got to do get your work done and be a little creative or whatever you don't want to be falling asleep personally I love and because just because I have ADHD and sativa sometimes can just make me a little more hyper than I want or they can make me super like ty explained sometimes if I get too much of a sativa I kind of get a little little like jittery anybody else can relate let me know but like I said any type of stuff that comes from this plant is gonna affect everybody differently it might be good and other people like it other people don't but that's with everything in life some popular sativas are definitely Maui Wowi super Lemon Haze Sour Diesel is a really big one being crack is a really popular one Jack Harrier super Lemon Haze tangi the list goes on now for in because well indica is give you more of like a body high there definitely for nine-time use because I don't know if you want to be sleepy while trying to be creative at work you go to me it helps a lot more when it comes to things like pain or with me like I said my ADHD indicas are more of a body high and they're very sedated they make you calm relaxed sleepy I like to associate indicas with making you somewhat of a couch potato it can make you sticky as what I say where you want to just stick to the couch and don't want to move that often happens a lot when it comes to in because making you like a couch potato types of indicas that are super popular here in Florida I know one is 9 pound hammer especially from truly if everybody's always posting that one granddaddy purp or granddaddy purple whatever you guys want to say is also a very popular indica Afghan Kush or a Ghani I know at my dispensary here at cure leaf it's Afghani and shabu banana alright y'all so let's talk about high ridge personally I like hybrids for during the day instead of using sativas but let me explain something when it comes to hybrids just to get this clear to everybody just because the name is a hybrid and as you know hybrid is like a mix of two things it is gonna be a mix of two things but some hybrids are definitely leaning towards different sides of the spectrum when it comes to the types of cannabis we describe it as being sativa dominant or indica dominant what it means is that it's a hybrid but it's gonna have a little more of both indica effects or a little more of the sativa effect usually the terms of use for that is the Teva dominant or indica dominant some hybrids that are 50/50 so it really just depends but definitely when you are going to purchase or whatever you want to deal with your we can definitely look up the strains online I know there's apps that you could use like Leafly or read map will give you the breakdown on the strain and tell you if the hybrid is the team a dominant or usually in the Kodama nation when it comes to hybrid you can get both effects of sativa and indica but sometimes you'll just have more indica or more steeper or both and those are great for people like me who during the day like to be uplifted more but also be calmer winning comes to my body because I'm hyper all the time some examples of hybrids are pineapple express oh my gosh that is like my favorite hybrid Girl Scout cookies I love Girl Scout cookie Blue Dream is a very popular one as well every time you tell somebody blue dream they're like oh my god blue dream that's my shrink and I'm like growing always real good yeah those are some hybrid strains but when it comes to symptoms usually and I want to make a whole nother video about that when carrying your symptoms I guess you can say like your pain or if you have a headache a lot of that also goes into ratios and I want to make a whole nother video on that about like ratios between CBD THC the different cannabinoids because there are so many that are in that plant it's not just THC and CBD we'll get into that in another video yo but for now these are what's usually associated with the different types of sativas are definitely more stress relievers they're usually good for headaches as well as stress depression anxiety thing creasing the serotonin in your body and being more uplifting and help with chronic pain so hope you focus which is why I like using a more suitable eating hybrid when it comes to during the day with indica they give you more of a mental relaxation they help a lot with acute pain nausea and vomiting for indicas they increase the dopamine in your body as well as help with inflammatory issues nausea and if you need to eat girl I would definitely go with an indica often associated with giving you munchies but I love it because I don't eat throughout the day and as soon as I have an indica end of my system a lot of the time I'm like girl hungry and I go and grab like scooby snacks and everything and I'm just eating the hope with anxiety and they help you sleep okay people's that's it for this video today I just wanted to make it quick and short for you guys and kind of get to the point and let you know what each one does remember that everything once again affects everybody differently and I'm not telling you what strain to choose I'm just educating you guys on what the differences are and yeah oh and remember sativas are for daytime Anika's are for nighttime to make you a couch potato they make you sleepy you're gonna have a good night's sleep you take an indica if you have a sativa it'll help you be creative stay focused stuff like that hybrid make sure both just depends which side is dominant got it got it all right I will talk to you guys later what do I wave in like every video bye", "Va8tlFpnhRg": "hey everybody how's it going my name is Chris and this is my shop partner oats and in this video I'm gonna be building the perfect woodworking workbench before I started this project I ran over to my local hardwood dealer to pick up some lumber and I'll be sharing some really cool info about that later on so I'm back at my shop I got all my lumber sorted out I have my stacks over here they're gonna be for the top over here behind me I have my stacks are gonna make up the legs which I'll rip to about six inches wide and the stretchers to about five inches wide first I'm gonna cut everything down closer to their final length on the miter saw so it's just that much material that I don't have to push through the table saw and we're gonna get started and get ready for glue up [Music] okay so now my bench top legs and stretchers are all cut to their rough length and glued up we're gonna take a couple hand planes now and smooth and flat and all these pieces out I'm gonna cut my bench top to its final length and then we're gonna start cutting all the mortise and Tenon's they're gonna be used to put this massive bench together so it's gonna be a lot of fun I'm excited about this part let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I want to pause real quick and think Johnson's workbench for sponsoring this video and let you know about a couple really cool things September 7th and 8th this year's Johnson's yearly wood Expo it's an incredibly cool two-day event filled with great deals booth reps from the major brands and a ton of awesome presentations and demos I'll be there both days with this new bench doing a presentation on traditional work benches and workholding so make sure you stop by say hi grab some of the killer deals and if you mention my name at checkout you'll get a free gift now I know a lot of people don't have a nice hardwood dealer closeby or they don't have the machinery to mill large lumber like this so I asked Johnsons if they'd work with me to create some work bench lumber packs for people to order they agreed and we created several options based on the size of bench and species of wood you want they'll straight line and rip one edge mill both faces flat and smooth and then ship it straight to your door ready for you to start building they're also going to waive the milling charges on these packages and give an additional discount if you order before September 8th 2018 there'll be more info on these packs down in the description all right so now I have the top relatively flat I made the legs and the stretchers and I caught all the joinery for those including these grooves for the twin screw vise now I'm going to lay out and drill the offset holes so that I can draw a bore all these mortise and Tenon's I'm going to install the vices make the sliding dead man and then we're going to assemble this giant beast of a bench hopefully it goes well because there's a not a lot of room for error here so let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a hybrid design of two of the most famous bench styles out there the French roubo style on one side and the English nicholson style on the other side when researching workbenches I really like the unique options that both of these individual bench styles offered but I didn't see any benches out there that incorporated both styles into one so about two years ago when I designed and built my first bench I decided to combine these two benches to give me all of those amazing workholding options and I've absolutely loved using that bench but I kicked myself for not documenting that build so I decided to rebuild it with a few minor tweaks so that can share it with you guys now I created plans for this bench in multiple sizes so that you can choose what size best fits your space and with those plans I've also provided another super detailed instructional video to help walk you through this build step by step I made my bench using hard maple but I designed these plans so that you can also use dimensional lumber like southern yellow pine if you're on a budget I install the Veritas twin screw vise as my front vise and they're quick release front vise as my advice I think these are the best vise options out there because they're not difficult to install and they're incredibly versatile and have the least amount of limitations that you can get with other types of vices these places are worth every penny but the really cool thing about this bench is that you can actually accomplish all your work holding needs without a vise I really like having vices because they give me a lot of extra options and versatility but you could build this bench and start using it while you've saved up to add devices later on I'll be demonstrating that in the presentation I'm doing and I'll also be creating a video in a couple weeks showing the features of this bench and demonstrating its amazing vise --less we're calling capabilities well there you go I hope you enjoyed the video I think the bench turned out amazing if you're interested in learning how to build this bench remember there's plans on my website along with that really detailed video also there's some merchandise for sale over there that you can check out and some other cool stuff and if you like this video and you haven't already please consider hitting that subscribe button let me

you're probably not going to be doing that with your normal bedtime routine hi everybody my name is Doug and today I'm going to be reviewing this mattress this is the lucid 12 inch latex hybrid mattress Lee it says right there by lucid which is a company you can order on Amazon I did a review of this mattress a few months back in the 10 inch variety if you haven't watched that one I would suggest you go back and watch the 10 inch review first then come back to this one the 12 inch it'll make more sense if you watch them in that order so I did order this on Amazon I had it shipped directly to my home it came in a box compressed I unboxed it just like all other but in the boxes watch my unboxing video if you don't understand that and one good thing is when I unboxed it there was no odor at all at the time I made my order it was between 400 and 450 dollars but prices can and do fluctuate so be sure to check them out yourself I'll put a link in the description box it's only about twenty five dollars more than the 10 inch variety and as far as what the differences are there is an extra transitional layer in this version and the coils are just a little taller so obviously put those two things together it's a thicker mattress it's two inches thicker than the 10 inch variety duh so what are my overall impressions I liked it a lot to be very straightforward this is the new king of Amazon budget mattresses and by that I mean the mid-ranged budget mattresses on Amazon that you can get above $300 more than $500 excuse me what I meant to say is more than three hundred dollars less than five hundred dollars so for mattresses in that range this is my new winner now I've had other matches that are more comfortable but those tend to be in the 800 to a thousand dollar range so this is my new favorite under $500 mattress and any time I refer to prices I'm talking about the queen size I almost entirely just deal in queen size as far as my reviews although they have this and all the regular common sizes as well so that's not a problem one of the things that I speculated in my 10 inch review video was that this would be a little better for side sleepers and my speculation was correct I said after sleeping on the 10 inch version for a week my shoulder started kind of sore I feel like he didn't sink in quite enough this solves that I didn't have the shoulder soreness at all so I'm very pleased with this mattress I'll go over a few more details and stay tuned to the end for my wrap-up ok let's do our standard demonstration as it relates to the bounciness and motion transfer first we'll check bounciness by using this bowling ball which weighs between roughly 12 and 16 pounds as I drop it from a variety of heights you'll see it does have some bounciness compared to the 10 inch variety I think it's just a little bit bouncier latex is a bouncy material so by adding a wee bit of latex I think you gain just a little more bounce let's try a real big one here see what happens just for fun oh yeah okay I mean you're probably not going to be doing that with your normal bedtime routine let's break out the sledgehammer of discernment here and check motion transfer and sinkage so you can also keep an eye on those books over there and see how much they're jiggling I would say overall my thoughts aren't that much different than they were with the 10 inch variety there's pry the same amount of motion transfer it's not the best it's not the worst condoms you're gonna get with most hybrids again latex is a little bouncier I personally like a mattress with a little bit of bounce if you got an all memory foam mattress you would have less motion transfer you know we could jump on the bed with a wine glass over there you're not gonna get that with this mattress but that's cool with me this is still my favorite type of mattress because I feel like when I have a mattress that's all memory foam and has zero motion transfer I get that trap sensation and I just I don't care for it maybe maybe I just haven't been able to get used to it edge support wise if I sit on the edge here with my hind end all the way back I'm not sinking down very much maybe two inches if I sit forward more aggressively I am compressing the top couple layers all the way down I can feel that further down layer but I don't feel like I'm sliding out at all if I sit right on the edge there's a little bit of a leaning sensation but not much this is a great mattress for sitting on so if you have some mild to moderate balance or mobility issues you just sit in the edge of the bed and tie your shoes this will be a great choice time for some views of me laying on the mattress starting with my side obviously so when I sleep on my side as I had mentioned my ability for my shoulder to sink into the mattress is definitely better here on the 12 inch than it was on the 10 inch I am a combination side and back sleeper so I usually start on my back but often end up on my side so this is totally fine no problems whatsoever I'm a happy camper and obviously your results are going to vary with your body composition shape and preference obviously I'm a full size adult man you know a 12 year old girl might have a different experience your results may vary when I lay on my back this feels really good also and I have no complaints I have someone of a curvature in my back I have a larger hind end which sinks in just the right amount on this mattress it's filling the entire space in the small of my back so I'm sinking in you know an inch to an inch and a half it's just right in my judgment this is just my opinion as it relates to firmness on a scale of one to ten where one is the least firm and 10 is the most firm this comes in at a six and a half to seven now I believe I said the 10 inch variety was a seven and a half to an eight and I wanted something just a hair or less firm this fits the bill perfectly so again this one is about a six and a half to seven on the firmness scale firmness doesn't tell the whole story you need to have things like support in mind as well but I think this is very supportive I'll give you a side angle facing away from the bed real quick here probably can't hear me quite as well but that's what it looks like that helps again just the right amount of sinkage it's filling my side area here while allowing my hind end to sink in the correct amount so not much pressure on the hips there I personally don't sleep on my stomach but I'll go ahead and demonstrate just in case that would be helpful for some of you so that's what that looks like so there we go if you found this video to be helpful please subscribe to my channel and please click the thumbs up button here's my final thoughts on this mattress go buy it it's a good mattress now obviously your personal preference gonna come into play just for reference I weigh in the neighborhood of 200 pounds and I'm about 5 foot 11 with that in mind I prefer a hybrid mattress something with both coils and either foam latex some sort of poly foam comfort layer this has that it's made to be just a hair bouncier because it's latex instead of an all memory foam and of the Lucid hybrid mattress series this would be the second most firm the ten inch which I reviewed previously is the most firm so if this video does well maybe I'll move over to the other two there's two memory foam hybrid versions 10 inch 12 inch which would be a little softer yet with that in mind who's this mattress good for who's it not good for it's good for heavy people so or moderately heavy people or just average weight people I think this would still support someone over 300 pounds pretty easily even a couple where say one person weighs 300 pounds in one weighs a little under 200 I think you'd be okay for at least three or four years I'm speculating because I tried it for 10 days not three or four years if it was a couple where you both weigh 300 pounds probably need to look for something a little more durable yet completely average size normal American sleeping couples I think this would be a great choice there's probably going to be some durability issues in the long run and same thing I said about the 10 inch if you're an established couple and you're established home I think of better ideas to invest a little more in a mattress go ahead and get that you know nine hundred or a thousand dollar mattress like a dream cloud or something like that that's play you lasted seven years but if you just want to kind of cut your losses or have less risk or maybe this is the best you can afford you know get one of these now and realize you might have to replace it in three to three-and-a-half years latex especially a more budget-friendly latex does break down a little faster than some materials so I've read a few reports online that this mattress only lasts about 3 to 4 years so as long as you're aware of that go ahead and order this now if you're buying like for a guestroom or something like that hey this will last 10 years no problem so that would be a great choice or an interim situation where you going off to college you just need it for three or four years and you're taking the summers off super or you know uh you own a bed-and-breakfast and you're gonna be using this mattress I would love it if I went to have been breakfast and they had this mattress you'll probably need to change it every three years or so but you know I wouldn't buy a $900 mattress if I had a bed breakfast anyway who is this not going to be good for there's only two categories I can think of one would be extremely lightweight people like under a hundred pounds might just kind of float on top of it and not thinking at all he might not like that again depends on the person you know some children might love this the other person who wouldn't like this is that you are insanely sensitive to motion transfer and you have a partner that flops around a lot because while it isn't horrible for motion transfer it's it doesn't mitigate all motion transfers average as it relates to motion transfer so those are my thoughts the Lucid 12-inch latex hybrid I love it good mattress I slept on it ten nights I could easily sleep ten twenty thirty more honestly if it wasn't for the fact that I review mattresses and I know there are some under $1000 that are even better I would think this is an amazing mattress so maybe your standards aren't as high as mine go ahead and get this and you'll think it's the grants mattress ever and you'll be perfectly happy so the new king of the mid-priced budget mattresses on Amazon I would appreciate it if you would use the link in my description box to get to Amazon or I'll put one in the

information online that everyone is confused about for flower breeding and animal crossing in this video I'm using the most up-to-date information on how to get every single flower hybrid color that exists in the game it is always best to start from flower seeds directly as every flower stole specific genes from how they were made by using seeds you can't go wrong in breeding hybrids that require specific flower genes every flower breeds in a grid with its own species for example cosmos with a cosmos if a flower is left alone in this grid it will effectively clone or duplicate itself when it's watered this is the perfect thing for cloning colors that you already have that are hard to breathe like if they have a very low percentage Tron's let's say blue roses which have a 1% chance to actually breed if you just clone them it will have a much higher chance to create more of that flower so it's efficient to breed colors you want and then start cloning them either by putting them in alone in a grid or with other flower species like my pink and black ones here that can clone into more of themselves around the spots around them watering flowers has a bonus to the breeding production rate that is 5% when you order them or if it's raining on your island but when your friends come over to your Island the rate has boosted even more if they water your flowers - if one frame boosts your rate by watering your flowers they'll boost it up to 25% if two friends do it it goes up to 35% and it goes up to a total of 80% if you have five or more friends water the same flower and you can see this by when the flower has a golden flash on it this means it has a very high rate to breed the next day pansies come in six colors red white yellow orange blue and purple to get orange you have to breed red with yellow with a hundred percent chance to breed to get blue you have to breed white with white with a 25% chance to breed to get special red which looks exactly like normal red there's actually no way to tell the difference you have to breed normal red with blue with a hundred percent chance to breed a special rate you'll know this is a special rate when you actually get a red from here that's braid from here it will have a special gene that helps you get the final color purple to get purple you can breed special raid with special raid a 6% chance to breed the purple you can see on screen have laid them out here for the best results once you have the purple blue and special red it will be much faster to breed more of it by using the clone method because it has a much higher chance to clone one rather than breeding it from scratch using the above hybrid breeding grids I hope this guide makes sense if you have any questions feel free to comment down below I do reply to every comment so you will hear back from me as soon as possible I'll see you guys in a future video thanks for watching [Music]", "yVmER_uJ24k": "because New Horizons was recently released there's a lot of misinformation when it comes to hybrid flowers guides are constantly being updated leading to confusion and hours spent trying to breed the wrong flowers for a while every guide I looked at didn't seem to match up as people experimented with the craziness that is animal crossing color theory the community has settled on these theories and by settled I mean we've just accepted that we all have no idea of what we're doing we need structure yeah sure the game is new there are other ways to get specific hybrid colors and these are most likely not the only ways originally this video was just supposed to be a hybrid guide but let's face it doesn't other people have already done that so this very unique video idea quickly fell out of my head what I did notice however is that none of the videos I've seen actually showed the process of getting the second tier of hybrid so I couldn't be certain if this is the most efficient way to breed these hybrids or how long it took these hybrids to spawn there are three classes of flowers first you have your primary flowers these are the whites yellows and reds unless that's a wind flower then the yellows replaced with orange but you know what I mean breeding these flowers gets you what I'm referring to as tier 1 hybrids examples of these are two red roses making a black rose of red and yellow Lily making an orange Lily a red and white cosmo making a pink Cosmo pretty simple if you plant the primary colors correctly next to each other these hybrids spawn in a couple of days the probability of obtaining these hybrids is high then you have what I call tier two hybrids these are created by taking two tier 1 hybrids crossbreeding them and creating another color hybrid there's also a thing where you like need to put two hybrids together to get like a hybrid primary color so technically that one's also tier 2 but this is too confusing why do we need hybrid Reds will have Reds that don't understand these tier 2 hybrids are the ones that I couldn't find a timeline for by the way quick side note many of the guides suggest planning your flowers in the zigzag esque style to optimize your hybrid breeding well I prefer this method for easier watering purposes and needing less flowers the side by side method does work just as well for me so it's all really however you want your flower set up on your island but the more spots you leave open around your flowers manner it gives the hybrids more options to spawn before beginning this hybrid experiment I had to clean up my island a bit flowers can only make hybrids if they're watered so you should only water flowers that you want to create hybrids with hybrids don't die New Horizons like they do in past Animal Crossing games tree saplings don't die either which is completely unrelated but something I felt like I needed to point out for some reason when it rains on your Island all your flowers get watered don't have to waste time breaking watering cans when it rains but this is New Horizons and when you arrive at your Island there are flowers all over the place to stop flowers from breeding when it rains I spent some time cleaning up and by some time I mean about 30 minutes or so of digging up roses while I was doing so I questioned if the multiplying weeds would be a negative factor part of me says probably not the other part of me spent another 30 minutes getting rid of all the weeds just in case also don't don't disconnect when weeding god dammit just don't have anyone else in your island it's devastating it's horrible I should have just stopped the video I did hear but I already gotten this far so he waited my entire Island all over again while creating this video a couple of the guides I used had changed a few times or were updated during the recording after scouring every guide I decided on this one now this is just a guide others have also important me of their crazy color combination experiences working to produce a specific color that isn't listed in any of the guys for my process I would plant specific flowers this time I used already bloomed Kosmos next to each other and water them I used too flimsy watering can at first because I felt like I needed the extra control over which flowers were watered but this thing breaks so freakin often ended up hitting some rocks to get iron to make a proper watering can't still don't last super long but longer than the flimsy one I have no idea what is in the water in New Horizons but goodness does it eat through wood and iron pretty freaking quickly I would then save and quit go to my switch settings time travel to the next day and repeat the process it is worth noting for all of you time-traveling addicts that if you travel back a day a week a month whatever the game does not count it as a new day but you must re water your flowers I guess because you've technically gone back in time before you watered them I don't know time travel is confusing so every time I reset its xx I would have to reward save quit and continue on to the next day on the third time travel day La pink cosmos easy peasy hello pink a few more broken tools later and we are off to breed orange cosmos a couple time-traveled days later we get orange cosmos again pretty simple I repeated this process with all the primary flowers to obtain these Tier one hybrids the next part is the horror that is tier two hybrid flowers day after day week after week nothing just more Tier one hybrids and then occasionally a primary flower no matter what I did these tier two hybrids never spawned I started trying to rearrange them maybe they needed more flower friends to be coaxed into creating a hybrid nothing worked did all these guides just lie to me maybe the way they got their hybrids wasn't the most efficient way and it was just dumb luck does time travel stunt flower growth probably not because all the other hybrids have just made and the dozens of guides online have all proven some type of success then there is the mysterious hybrid flower Island a nook miles mystery island completely covered in hybrids from one type of flower I reached out on Twitter and through a community post on YouTube to see what all of your experiences were with these second tier hybrids some of you had similar problems to me others had no problems whatsoever I did notice a large number of those that had no problems getting these tier two hybrids harvested their tier 1 hybrids from hybrid Island do these flowers have better chances at spawning new flowers are these people just far luckier than I think we've decided the answer to that one is probably yes so what if I wants a hybrid Island and found my own flowers to breed would I have just as much bad luck as I've been having or is the probability for spawning the next level of hybrids higher with these flowers the only way to find out was to buy 11 nook miles tickets and hope for the best on the tenth one I found it hybrid island full of blue and orange pansies I loaded up in the flowers flew back home unsure of how easy it would be to spawn a hybrid I planted four different groups of the blue and orange flowers so I could get the hybrid orange pansies so I could breed the two hybrid hybrid oranges together to get purple at least that was the plan and then two days into this plan lo and behold a purple pansy this is the most frustrating thing ever i time-traveled countless days to try to get these naturally and nothing then you go to hybrid and instantly I get what I'm looking for I have no idea what this means I'm not some oatmeal Dome data miner but I'm assuming it has something to do with the probabilities of breeding new flowers maybe these hybrids have better probabilities attached to them kind of like how Caterpie is a 5% spawn rate and reading for us in pokemon red but you hop on over to pokemon blue and the probability increases to 50% maybe it's a similar idea creating these hybrids on your own island has a miniscule chance of being successful spend a few Nook miles to find the mystery hybrid island and now your odds have jumped so high that these hybrids are now a piece of cake to breed but this was my experience in the experience of some others who have talked to this may not be your experience it seems there are almost no precise rules that we know of when it comes to breeding hybrids are finding the best combinations of colors I got far more pink roses from two red roses than I did black roses doesn't make any sense there's no concrete way to do it as frustrating tedious and time-consuming it was to spend three days straight watering flowers and time-travelling the outcome is very animal crossing' esque you play your own way you find your own experiences share them with others and you enjoy the spoils of all your hard work what's your experience with hybrids and new horizons have you bred hybrids from primary all the way to the end of the hybrid line please let me know in the comments below cuz I want to know if it's possible and hopefully some kind of exploitation is discovered soon otherwise I'll see you in the next Animal Crossing video bye [Music] there is a blue balloon I am so sick of these Easter balloons it's a day to clay god damn it should've just ignored it", "pamzJGxyp5c": "hey guys martin here from madness clarity if you're looking for a luxury hybrid mattress it's also a good value you've come to the right video because today i'm talking about the dreamcloud mattress i'm going to talk about its construction my experience with it who it's a good fit for and who it's not a good fit for let's get started [Music] first off you want to see a list of our top picks for mattresses head over to mattdisclary.com they're going to find some great reviews on mattresses bedding pillows and some great discounts on mattresses like the dream cloud so dreamcloud now offers two mattresses the cloud and the dream cloud premiere today we're talking about the dream cloud their more affordable model now while it is more affordable it still has some very nice luxury flourishes i was excited to try it out for myself let's hop in so now let's take a look at the construction of the dream cloud mattress first stop it's going to be 14 inches tall then starting on top and then working our way down we have a nice cashmere cover here very soft very breathable as well it's going to be tufted with foam to kind of add some plushness to the top of the mattress below that you're going to have a layer of gel memory foam so soft adds a little bit of pressure relief at the top of the mattress also that gel infusion is going to help with cooling below that a foam transition layer that's going to be there to kind of make sure you don't sink too far into the mattress and bottom out specifically when you're on your side below that you're going to have your support coils right here the bottom of the mattress and that all is going to rest on a layer of thin foam as well so what does all that mean well being a hybrid mattress you get a good balance of comfort and support from this kind of construction so support from the coils here then comfort from the top foam layers here on top of the mattress now speaking of breathability and cooling i think it should be a pretty breathable cool sleeping mattress breathable cover gel infusion in the memory foam here and also some breathability and airflow with the coils here and last but not least speaking of durability looking at the coils here the foams on top this kind of mattress overall probably say it's going to last for between six seven and eight years and now let's talk about firmness and feel in terms of firmness i thought dream cloud was around a seven and a half out of ten firmer than average now that is because on top of the mattress you have a little bit of plushness but beneath that it does get quite firm i do want to note though that i'm a larger person i'm 250 pounds i'm pressing further into this mattress if you're lighter than me it might feel softer to you but for me a seven and a half out of ten now speaking of feel with that plushness on top you get a little bit of kind of soft comfort but lying on this matters you kind of more feel the coil so overall has more of a kind of classic inner spring mattress feel with some good bounce though and testing that out here i mean look at that i can't even keep my hand on the ball very bouncy very responsive easy to move around on the dream cloud so now let's talk about how i feel in different sleeping positions on the dream cloud mattress on my back a very good match for me a nice balance of comfort and support my hips sink in just the right amount so good lumbar support a bit of contouring as well so very nice for back sleeping moving to my side though i'm feeling some serious pressure on my shoulders and my hips i want to note though i'm a larger person i'm pressing further into this mattress than a lighter person might if you're in the lighter end lighter than me i'm 250 pounds you might feel better pressure relief on your shoulders and your hips at the same time moving to my stomach not quite supportive enough for me i'm bowing at the hips a little bit and i'm getting out of alignment here at matasplayer you'll have to make subjective opinions objective tests and one of those tests is the pressure map so i lie down on my back side and stomach you see anywhere from blue for no pressure all the way up to red for high pressure now pay close attention to my side sleeping results specifically on my shoulders and my hips let's get started [Music] so [Music] if you sleep with a partner you also want to think about motion transfer base if you're lying down on one side of the mattress and your part moves around on the other side are going to feel that motion or not now to test the motion transfer out on the dream cloud to place the glass of water here in the center gonna push into other areas here you can see it is disturbing the water quite a bit while there is memory foam in this mattress it's not too surprising to me though there is some motion transfer mostly because you have coils pretty high up in the mattress it's a bouncier mattress overall not really absorbing that motion now also to test this out i laid down on one side of the mattress and danny moved around on the other side changed positions got in and out of bed and i definitely felt his movements on my side of the mattress so overall not the best handling of motion transfer with the dream cloud if you sleep with a partner or you like sleeping towards the edge of the mattress you also want to think about edge support basically you're sitting down or lying down at the edge of a mattress do you feel secure or marketing to roll off and onto the floor so i'm sitting down near the edge of the dream cloud it is collapsing quite a bit even with these coils in the mattress again i'm a larger person i'm 250 pounds if you're lighter it might not be quite as much of an issue but not getting the best support in this position now lying down on this mattress i'm lying pretty close with the edge rolling around a little bit it's collapsing a little bit towards the edge i don't feel like i'm going to fall off per se but overall not the best edge support with the dream cloud so now let's talk about the pros and who i think the dream cloud mattress might be a good fit for first off it's a very good option for back sleepers excellent balance of comfort and support your hips sink in just the right amount good lumbar support good overall support as well it's also a good option i think for hot sleepers with these coils in the construction a lot of room for airflow also a breathable cover shouldn't trap too much heat should make for a cooler night of sleep and last but not least if you want more of a responsive mattress that makes it easy to move around the dream cloud is definitely a good option for you while it does have memory foam in its construction it's still overall a bouncier mattress not too hard to reposition at night and now let's talk about the cons and who i think the dreamcloud mattress might not be the best fit for first off i don't think it's the best choice for side sleepers it is on the firmer end so lying on your side on this mattress you might feel some pressure on your shoulders and your hips i think in general not the best option for heavier people well it does have coils in the construction they aren't the most supportive coils so if you're a much larger person over 250 pounds closer to 300 pounds you might want to look for a more supportive mattress overall and then last but not least if you like more of a slow moving memory foam feel with your mattress that's not really what you get with the dream cloud it does have memory foam in its construction but has more of a bouncy responsive feel overall if you're taking a look at the dreamcloud mattress you might want to know how it compares the dreamcloud premiere so let's do that right now first off they're going to be some construction differences basically the dream cloud premiere is a more substantial mattress than the dream cloud there are more layers in the comfort section of the mattress also the dream cloud premiere is a plusher mattress than the dream cloud so the feel is slightly different with the dream cloud premiere more of kind of a plush kind of pillow-toppy feel on top of the mattress over the dreamcloud premiere overall more of kind of an innerspring mattress feel now in terms of firmness the dream cloud is going to be firmer than the dream cloud premiere and also in terms of price the dream cloud is going to cost less than the dream cloud premiere so who should get one and who should get the other in terms of who should get the dream cloud mattress it's a better option for those who want something firmer and those were looking to save money in terms of who should get the dream cloud premiere definitely a better option i think for site sleepers those who prefer something on the softer end those who want something more substantial overall and now let's talk about how the dream cloud premieres to the saatva mattress one of its main competitors there are going to be some construction differences mainly in the support layer of the mattress so with the dream cloud one set of coils with the saatva two set of coils support coils and micro coils on top of that gonna be some slight feel differences as well so with these thought was going to have more of an inner spring feel with a pillow top on top of that i was getting more of an overall inner spring feel from the dreamcloud mattress in terms of firmness we found the saatva to be softer than the dream cloud and in terms of price the dream cloud is gonna be a little bit more affordable than the saatva so who should get one and who should get the other in terms of who should get the dream cloud between the two a better option for stomach sleepers and also those who want to save a little bit of money on their mattress purchase now in terms of who should get the saatva i think a better option for side sleepers in general also those want to get something a little bit more substantial a little bit more durable the dream cloud is a bed in a box mattress so it's going to come to your house in a cardboard box how do you unbox it well first off take it inside with the help of a friend you don't want to strain yourself the box can be quite heavy then take the box into your bedroom open it up and take out the rolled up mattress now place that on your favorite foundation and slowly carefully cuff the layers of plastic you don't want to damage your brand new mattress then clear away the plastic all the packing materials give it about 24 to 48 hours to completely expand and you're good to go so now i'd like to give you some additional information about the dream cloud mattress first off it comes with free shipping and returns a 365 night sleep trial a lifetime warranty to offer other mattress models accessories and financing as well [Music] so now i'd like to answer some frequently asked questions about the dream cloud mattress the first question is is the dream cloud a good mattress and i would say it's a good mattress but it's more about what you're looking for i think if you are a back sleeper you want something more breathable you also want a very nice luxury kind of hybrid mattress for an affordable price the dream cloud is definitely a good mattress for you second question is is the dream cloud good for side sleepers in my opinion it's not the best option for side sleepers it is on the firmer end unless you're much lighter you're probably not going to get the best pressure relief on the dream cloud the last question is do you need a box spring with the dreamcloud mattress now according to the company you do not need a box spring with this mattress but you can use a box spring with the dream cloud in the end i think the dream cloud is a good option for back sleepers hot sleepers and those who want something a little bit more responsive but that's about it just getting started looking for a mattress or bedding head over to mattisclary.com we also do a lot of videos just like this so hit the like button and subscribe you", "n7k6J8BHoc4": "we often get asked why we say certain colors means certain things in scriptures in dream interpretation and I said scripture because that's on my mind because the first place that we always go to understand what something means is by looking at Scripture so let's take a look at a couple of them we'll start with red red we say that red often represents wisdom or anointing and to the negative it represents war or anger now to the positive wisdom or anointing why would we say that it actually comes out of the blood of Jesus the blood is red and it says that the blood of Jesus of the cross of Christ is the wisdom of God and so the blood being shed is the revelation of God's wisdom so red would represent wisdom and red would also represent anointing because it's the blood of Jesus that is the key that allows us to have relationship with Holy Spirit so that we can be anointed and have an anointing because the only annoying thing that we want is the anointing of the Holy Spirit now to the negative why would we say that it's war or anger and anger leads to war it leads to striving and war means blood and so again it's related to blood and an anger will lead to blood being shed when left given its full course and so that's why it would represent that now here's another example blue we say blue will often represent revelation or communion with God why well here's one of the reasons when you come to God's throne you will find blue in front of the throne it's the sapphire stone and when Moses went up on to the mountain with 70 of the elders and they sat down and they had a meal with God they had a meal on a sapphire pavement no sapphires blue and they sat before God on the sapphire pavement and John saw that SAFF see he actually saw it as a sea as smooth as glass in front of the throne so to one it look like pavement to another it was like a sea but it was smooth as glass and it's in front of the throne and so it represents that place of communing with God being in front of the throne and being in that place of communion or that place of Revelation when John had that voice that called him saying come up here he was he was being brought into a place of revelation or revealing that's the reason why that would mean that now green we talk about green often talking about a place of growth or a place of life now why would green mean growth or life well because green things grow we get that out of nature not a specific biblical reference for this but the church throughout the ages has talked about the two books of God that the nature in creation itself speaks of him Romans chapter 1 says all created things that speaks of his glory and so there there's a revelation of God's ways and who God is through nature and so you can look at nature and it'll give you an understanding of how God he created it that way for a purpose and so if he uses it metaphorically it's most likely going to relate to the purpose that he created it for grass green plants often represents life it represents growth now culturally depending on the culture it can also have some some other meanings and green can represent something new or somebody that's immature they're a little bit green meaning they're they haven't matured yet they haven't grown yet and so that is is one of the things that it can mean in a level of immaturity yellow yellow representing hope or representing fear now let's start with the fear piece because that again that's a cultural reference yellow representing fear they they've got a yellow streak and that's a phrase or a cultural reference to somebody that operates out of fear and so that where we get that not again there's nothing clear in Scripture that points to yellow that says that it represents that but out of out of the way that we use it then let me give you an example that may help you understand this concept God doesn't speak in English just as who he is he speaks in English because you and I understand it he has his own language but he uses the language that we use so that we can understand him hey when he distributed all the languages he knows the language and so he'll speak to somebody in the language that they speak because he wants them to understand and the same thing is true of metaphors he'll use metaphors that are familiar to us so that we can understand them and so so another is gray now grey is a mixture of black and white it's not black it's not white and gray can represent something that where the lines are blurred between what's black and white but gray also represents maturity and we get that because people's hair turns gray as they get older and we know that that physically our physical bodies as they mature they turn gray and so God will often use gray to talk about maturity now you actually get that out of the scripture as well when you look at proverbs it talks about gray hair representing maturity and representing wisdom and that's a key that we pay attention to so when you're looking at colors one of the things that you ask is can I find this in scripture if you can find it in scripture that gives you precedents if you can't find it in Scripture is there something that I'm familiar with that would anchor this that would help me to understand this maybe it's something out of culture maybe it's something out of your experience that would help you and again we're always going back and saying God what do you mean by this because sometimes he'll give you a color that doesn't make any sense but then he'll tell you what it means because he knows what it means he's the one that gave it to you [Music] you", "kbpCG6Uyyy4": "hey guys it's mike and in this video we're going to be smoking some blue dream blue dream strain it's a little windy out so it's going to be hard to light so let's see what we could do there we go tastes great tastes just like sweet berries if i'm not mistaken blue dream is a sativa dominant hybrid usually i only smoke indica before bed but um this is all i had to work with so it is what it is very very nice this thing is smoking very nice tastes just like i said sweet berries like blueberries sweet berries hints of raspberry even sounds crazy but really and the thing is burning down nice [Music] getting stoned already up a few hits it's potent stuff right here guys this has 28 thc in it i get medical marijuana in my state of connecticut i'm a medical marijuana patient so you can definitely find out the percentages when you go to the dispensary of the buds you pick up it says it on the bottle and this one happened to be 20 did i say 27 and maybe 28 percent thc something like that so i'm just coming at you guys with this video before i go to sleep it's like two in the morning can't sleep i woke aleena i'll go figure trying to make this video i feel bad sorry babe but um yeah guys his butt is smoking down great really good uh bud to smoke honestly before bed it is sativa dominant but at the same time it's a very mellow feeling you get from smoking this bud this strain blue dream so it's good to settle into bed with and uh kick it feel me out of 10 i'd give this butt a solid eight very good weed very good marijuana cannabis very nice very nice very nice but anyways let's just take one more drag off this i'm gonna roach it put it out and uh i'm gonna get some uh some need to sleep

for Animal Crossing New Horizons this video is the ultimate guide on how to plant flowers and get those super rare hybrid flowers to show up in your town like this very awesome pink tulip over here so thanks so much for watching now we're gonna divide this video with the basics of how to get yourself started and then we're gonna go into exactly how the hybrids work so if you guys already know the basics of planting and everything like that awesome but I'm gonna make it a course so that you guys are familiar everyone's there so the very first thing you're gonna need is two different tools as you guys can see you're going to need a shovel and you'll need a watering can a shovel is gotten from blathers if you've donated all of your fish and stuff like that to Tom Nook you open up the museum you'll be able to get a shovel there the watering can is available at Timmy and Tommy's so make sure that you guys head on over there and while we're over to Timmy and Tommy's we might as well buy a couple more things I'll show you guys what's up so go inside nooks cranny whatever available section you have I don't know if it gets bigger or small or whatever I'll head on over and you guys should be able to purchase a lot more things now inside this little cupboard is what you're going to need there's going to be some DIY recipes for some more tools inside here you can get the the flowering can recipe inside here yeah the flimsy one you can absolutely get this recipe for and then one of the other things that you do want to take a look at is the additional flowers that they sell for bells you get some highest scents you can get some tulips you get some wind flowers and then of course it changes every single day so definitely take a look at that I've only seen those three flowers in the game so I don't know when jacob's ladder or roses come into play maybe once the nuking Tain's shop like opens up you'll have access to even more of them but again this is going to be a beginner's guide now if you guys have noticed that on the top portion of your map there's going to be tons and tons of different regular wind flowers available that you can easily pick up and grab along the way and you can do a little bit of testing of them to see what kind of hybrids you can get so now that you guys have access to a basic shovel and a basic watering can and if you're far enough in the game that you have the Town Hall I want you guys to head on over here and get the recipe inside the abd for the better shovels and the better tools so simply put head on over there go over and you're gonna be all set with accessing the abd for all of that fun stuff so anyway I'm not here to talk about Tom Nook or my loan but this is exactly where you're going to get the extra tools from and I'll show you that right now so that's this once per day you get bonus miles etc jump inside here go to redeem Nick miles and once you have a nook nook miles there's going to be some recipes for some different tools now I've already done it so it's not gonna print it out again but you're gonna be able to find the recipes here for the better sets of tools now the reason why I keep on promoting the better sets of tools is because you really want to focus on getting the regular watering can the regular watering can is able to spray in more than just one singular square so if you want hybrid flowers to be a thing that you do every single day you're definitely going to want that water again so anyway as you guys can see over here the recipes are as follows I'll show you guys this so we're gonna craft we're gonna come over to the shovel which is the first one that I talked to you guys about you're gonna need five hardwood and then moving on with the flimsy shovel in hand you're going to need one iron nugget so five hardwood one iron nugget gets you the good shovel likewise with the flimsy watering can 5 soft wood gives you the flimsy one and if you want the good one you're gonna need the exact same thing another iron nugget for it so now ladies and gents you have all the tools available I told you guys how to get them now let's start talking about how hybrids work in the game now I was able to successfully breed three different hybrid flowers in the game you guys can see over here we have the pink hyacinths and we do have my very cool pink tulip that I made not too long ago now you'll notice right over here I've got a couple different areas that I'm using the breeding grounds for this is your prime example it's the easiest example that you guys can use now if you do it in a diagonal pattern meaning like a little checker kind of a set or if you think about like a five on a little dice you guys can see it that way so whenever there's an open spot I'm gonna give you an example right over here is going to be an open spot actually I can move up a little bit this is our open spot here one open spot there you can see that there's an open spot right over here and there's gonna be one over here and you guys get the point right all of those open spots are gonna be potentials where hybrids can eventually show up pretty cool right so as long as you guys have these guys next to each other you're going to get hybrids but you have to water them too so you want to think of it as this way so this white one is only touching another white one so that means that these spaces that are completely around it over here can potentially be a white plus a white hybrid which could potentially just be a regular old white or maybe something that we haven't seen before so that's why I kind of left it like that now this spot over here this white is also touching this red whereas it's also touching this red and it's also touching these whites so the potentials for you to get a pink one of these could potentially land right over here it could land over here it could land over here it can land into any one of these empty spots as you guys can see so remember again the rule is as long as these two are touching each other they don't have to be directly next to you can go on a diagonal and it'll absolutely work so that's exactly your example there so with the regular watering can you could stand in your empty spot and as you guys can see it does a sweeping motion that hits about what five five spots six spots if you take a look at it and when you notice that your flowers are shiny or sparkling that means that they're ready to produce offspring potentially on the next day so that's exactly how that's gonna work we take a look over here say hi to mr. Resetti and you guys can see some other things that are happening on board this is what I've seen and I have not touched anything since yesterday as you guys can see oranges plus oranges Nets a potential orange right over here so this little guy that I'm standing on right here is a potential new flower it's just gonna take another day in order to grow to bloom right over here not really sure what this is going to be this can potentially be I don't even know a pink one somehow I have no clue how that possibly happened but maybe that's how the little red ones look before they are before they bloom and I have a white one over here that I need to find another white one for this spot so super easy right so if you're looking at transplanting some like let's say for example over here this these are going to be my tulips and you guys can see that there is so many different wildlife that are attracted to flowers you've got this ladybug over here you've got some other different butterflies you've got a lot of things that are on board so what happened over here was as you guys can see this red one somehow bred with this white one and was able to produce an offspring right over here so this is our hybrid which is this pink one so what I'm gonna do with the pink one if I want to transplant it or at least hold on to it I can hold on to my shovel and I can absolutely dig it up and it's going to be in my inventory you guys can see it right over here pink tulip plant and if I want to put it anywhere I want like let's say I want to potentially breed a pink one with these two red ones right if I want to do that I would just I don't even have to dig you don't even have to dig it you just stand right over here and then click on plant and you're all set so now I don't know what's gonna happen a pink one is going to breed with a potential red one and another potential red one for any of these empty spots right over this way and pause the tutorial for a second because I gotta grab this it's like you get a phone call while you're recording something and you say yo don't call me right now I just let's go stop anyway so that's exactly how I got these pink ones right over here these pink ones came on board simply by doing this entire field out of the way I'm sorry this entire field and the pink ones showed up right over here on this side and I was really really excited for it so that's exactly how you're going to breed all of your different flowers now you can indeed clump them together and there's really nothing wrong with clumping these guys together as you guys can see here I'm gonna stand on board we're going to water every single one of these and yeah I was able to do a little diagonal checker pattern with these red and white ones and then a pink one just randomly showed up but if you want the maximize odds for all of your different flowers to come on board then you're gonna need to do the little diagonal patterns with some spaces in between them so now that that one bred an extra white one I can come over here and I can put my white one in here in hopes of making even more pink ones that come out and as you guys can see over here you can't really crossbreed species of different plants as I was just kind of testing and I haven't seen anything come through or maybe there is I don't know that would be interesting if you could crossbreed species I mean that would be an animal crossing first and I wouldn't put it past the developer is to do something like that right anyway so there's a lot of empty space in the northern parts of everyone's towns right did you guys actually take the time to excavate it all to get rid of all the weeds if you did good on you as of right now these are all the extra stray wildflowers that I had in my town so what I did was I just made a little diagonal pattern over here and who knows maybe after a couple days I can indeed collect some hybrid pink ones so I like it it's a cool thing it's just one extra thing to do now that you're just kind of playing Animal Crossing right like what else is there to do I'm done collecting bells that's for sure wink-wink nudge-nudge so as you guys can see over here just make it a point to if you do have a little garden of wild flowers or tulips or whatever you have just make sure that you make it a point to actually water them I don't believe that the flowers actually die in this game I at least I haven't seen you can run over flowers if you really want to but they'll always grow back and as you guys can see over here your watering can can indeed break away so ladies and gents that's going to be it thanks so much for watching I hope you guys learned a little bit more about hybrid flower breeding I can't wait to find out what colors you guys can come up with so let me know in the comments if you guys come up with anything really awesome I'm very very curious the yellow tulips are interesting I think that yellow and red could potentially make an orange I haven't confirmed it yet and maybe an orange and white wildflower can make something I don't know I'm looking forward to all of your hybrids in the comment section below let me know what you came up with feel free to share some pictures that add Abdallah nation right over here and we'll go from there so thanks so much for watching I hope this video tutorial did help you out with learning everything you know about hybrids now hybrids are definitely going to be something that you cannot buy with bells now that bells are so easily accessible in the game definitely think that the trading power for a specific hybrid plant goes way higher than anything that you could purchase with those so anyway so subscribe for even more tips and tricks tutorial videos make sure you guys are on board with that join to become a member you guys can hang out in our discord where we have tons of channels and lots of people constantly trading and talking about Animal Crossing every single day so make sure you're on board with that but other than that looking forward to reading all of your comments take care we'll see you on the next tutorial video see ya", "G6LigiflRzw": "you see this thing it's a Toyota Corolla yeah that boring car you drove in college but wait something's different this isn't the infinite void of vehicular dullness you know and I have no particular affinity for the Toyota Corolla isn't what like its twelfth generation heritage be damned this is a sassy little beast built atop the same platform as the Corolla hatchback be cool a sedan is lower and wider than the previous Corolla and features an independent rear suspension that positively contributes to ride and handling apply to the right corner the ocurro achieves fling Abul status thanks to oh yeah quick steering and composed handling granted this particular Corolla is the sporty-er top tier X SE trim but Toyota clearly now recognizes there is an emotional component to cars for perspective here's the more pedestrian le trim still quite nice for more emotion check out the modestly priced but still zippy looking SE trim which can be had with a 6-speed manual transmission well what about drivers who want to have less fun Toyota has you covered with the Corolla Hybrid yes the Corolla is now offered as a not weirdly styled hybrid offering a paltry 121 horsepower if speed is your game you'll want to play elsewhere but if you dig efficiency check out these numbers 53 City mpg with a base MSRP below $24,000 makes the Corolla Hybrid le the kind of value your grandfather will briefly appreciate before veering into an uncomfortable conversation about how no one understands the value of hard work any more days are too soft among non electrified Karolos there are two 4-cylinder engines a 1.8 liter found in the L le and xle trims and a harder 2 liter engine reserved for the zestier Corolla S II and XS e interestingly the smaller engine is not more efficient aside from the manual SE trim volt engines compared with continuously variable transmissions also known as CVTs in automotive circles CVT is a four-letter word thanks mostly to their groaning engine revs and surging acceleration thankfully the Toyota Corolla mostly avoids those pitfalls the CVT teamed with the 2-liter engine features a clever launch gear that helps the Corolla move off the line in pleasing fashion once moving the CVT responds rapidly raising revs when your right foot requested boy that's a lot of ours the Corollas propulsive immediacy is matched by grabby brakes and a pedal to operate them that's a very light resistance you can come to a smooth stop but it takes a delicate touch before moving on let's take a moment to talk about the interior a lot of this stuff is copy/paste from my Corolla hatchback review let's see material quality is weirdly good for a compact car especially on the higher trims no disc stitching the center armrest needs more padding but I love how it slides letting me rest my elbows while keeping both hands on the wheel and the front seats offer a long-distance comfort with serious lower back support from the available power seats lumbar adjustment [Music] I also dig the nicely adjustable driving position though for my body type just a bit more extension from the telescoping steering wheel would move me just that much closer to 100% comfort so this is pretty good oh and the visors extend too laterally block a vengeful Sun and before you leave a comment telling me I'm derivative I was testing Sun visors long before the straight pipes made it a thing Jerry Jacob love you guys and back headroom is tight for taller occupants but my knees clear the seat back at least with a mica sized 5 foot 10 inch driver up front the middle spot is cozy though one more neat thing if you're a super cool dad who still cares somewhat about safety in the gauge cluster there's little display showing which of the rear seat belt have been latched as a concerned father that matters to me [Music] open the trunk you'll find a decent 13.1 cubic feet dropping the rear seats for larger loads is a little inconvenient though since these seat releases are in the cabin and inboard of the headrests interior storage consists of an average-sized damp glovebox bottle storage and the doors first time few central cupholders and small storage in the center console the cabin is perfectly comfortable but can I make a request to Toyota next time make this a little bit deeper because when I put my phone here there's nowhere really to put the cord on a related note infotainment I love how the screen is supplemented by physical buttons truth be told there are slicker looking interfaces and the reactions could be a little bit snappier but all the essentials you'd want in an infotainment system are there I do have to point out though Android auto smartphone integration is still not available once again sorry Android users however iPhone users have been granted standard apple carplay through out the Corolla lineup other Corolla standards include power windows and locks LED head and tail lights eight airbags a 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty and Toyota's safety sense 2.0 a suite of driver supporting technologies like lane departure warning with steering assist automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and dynamic cruise control with stop and go abilities on CVT models in action the systems work with competent finesse for example yesterday I was coming home with the dynamic cruise active and a car pulled in front of me and the Corolla didn't freak out it just smoothly applied the brakes we slowed down and then kept on going no drama we already have enough of that in the LBC while we're on the freeway I will note a slight wandering tendency and somewhat dirty high speed handling thanks to the same speedy steering ratio that feels so lovely at slower speeds the same time ride quality is good the latest girl is both smooth and sassy which sounds like a good description for a barbecue sauce mmm the cheapest corolla l trim has an MSRP around twenty thousand five hundred dollars including destination charges that's fine but for our money we'd step up at least one in trim level to the Le trim to add stuff like automatic climate control centre rear armrest and an upgrade from a seven to an eight-inch touchscreen even further up the food chain you can outfit your Corolla with smart key access with push button start blind spot monitoring and wireless phone charging maximum decadence yields an excess etrem with an MSRP under 28 grand filling out the competitive set we've got the Kelley Blue Book Award winning Honda Civic the suddenly upscale Mazda 3 the value rich Kia Forte the all-wheel drive Subaru Impreza plus a few others like it's clean lookin hatchback sibling the Corolla sedan is comfortable competitively priced packed with safety and has a Toyota badge so resale values should remain strong most importantly it's fun like the uptight nerd in a screwball comedy the Toyota Corolla has learned a valuable lesson about letting loose that's a lesson we can all use a refresher on you", "gAjvwIfJD6Q": "colors are beautiful and most people have a favorite color but our colors really important when it comes to dreams [Music] God created color and colors are mentioned throughout the scriptures in fact the first sign that God gave man was the rainbow which was not only colorful and beautiful but it emanated from God himself in Genesis the ninth chapter and the thirteenth verse it says I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth ezekiel described the vision he saw God on the throne in the first chapter of Ezekiel and he talked about the rainbow that surrounded him also John described the vision he had of God with a rainbow around his throne as well in fact in Revelations 4:3 it says and he who sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and so most of us learned about the color spectrum from school or in school we learned that Isaac Newton actually discovered the seven colours of the rainbow and we learned the seven colours of the rainbow with an acronym I know I did it was ROYGBIV which stood for red orange yellow green indigo blue violet I might have had it backwards but those are the seven colors of the rainbow and so after shining a light through a three-sided prism Newton discovered that the light actually separated into the seven colours of the rainbow and then the colors refracted back as white light so for Newton's experiments we know that colours come from white light and that the colours that surround the throat of God we emanate from God himself in first John 1:5 it says God is light and in him is no darkness at all so by studying the Scriptures we can begin to understand that colors have meaning and they symbolize something in particular in a dream in Exodus 20:8 2 God gave Moses specific instruction concerning Aaron's garments he said and you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother for glory and for beauty we know that the robe of Aaron's ephod was entirely made of blue but why in Exodus the 26th chapter in the first verse God was very specific about the colors to be used in constructing the tabernacle he said moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them the colors of the stones on the priest if I were twelve distinct colors we also know that colors build a description of heaven in the book of Revelation the 21st chapter verses 19 through 21 it says and the foundation of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones and the 12 gates were twelve pearls when it comes to dreams colors are probably the most overlooked element so it's important to know that God will use color to help us in understanding a dreams meaning colors and dreams can have a positive or a negative meaning for incense the color blue in the positive sense it could represent revelation communion with God or it could represent something heavenly but in the negative since the color blue could represent sorrow or grief or depression or even anxiety so when it comes to dreams how do you know we'll have to apply the color to the dream whether it's negative or whether it's positive how do you know it depends on the context of the dream what's going on in the dream that will tell you how to apply the color to the dream for instance if I have a dream that my friend is wearing the blue dress and she's crying well I know in that dream that the color blue we represent grief or sorrow or depression because of a context of the dream what's going on in a dream she said she's crying and she's wearing blue that means she is blue or sad so the context of the dream whatever's going on in the dream will tell you how to apply the color in the dream so let's look at some colors all right so the color white in dreams in the positive sense the color white can represent purity it can represent righteousness or cleansing or even the Spirit of the Lord but negatively in a dream the color white can represent false Christianity or a religious spirit again it depends on what's going on in a dream the correct can represent a power anointing even wisdom but negatively the color way can represent anger or wrath or even war as in the saying you know I'm seeing red which means I'm very angry so we would apply that to whatever is going on in the dream the color green can represent prosperity growth even the conscious or the spirit but in the negative sense the color green can represent and be like I'm green with envy or jealousy or even pride it can represent the flesh and it can also represent immaturity something not like our not ready yellow can represent hope the gift of God it can even represent courage it can represent the mind or the glory of God but negatively the color yellow can indicate fear or cowardness or even caution as in the yellow light caution to slow down a warning I could be warning you of something if the color yellow is in a dream but again it depends on the storyline what's going on in the dreamy purple in the positive sense can represent Authority or kingship it can also represent great wealth because we know in the Bible it tells us stories how the rich or the wealthy people were able to afford the purple cloths in that day so it can indicate wealth as well in a negative sense purple can represent false authority so the opposite of authority is false Authority it can also represent immorality when I was a teenager I think I was about 17 years old I had a dream that I was looking in the mirror in my bedroom and as I looked at myself by the way mirrors and dreams can represent how God sees you or how you see yourself or your reflection and so I was looking in the mirror and out of my mouth proceeded a two-edged purple sword and so I woke up and I had no idea at that age what that dream meant but as years went on I discovered that a sword in dreams can represent the Word of God and so that was showing me in my teen years my purpose and my destiny as far as teaching the Word of God with authority great dream the color orange in the positive sense can represent perseverance orange can also represent transitional change this depends on what's going on in the dream in the negative sense orange can represent stubbornness or being strong-willed or even a flesh pink pink can represent love it can represent emotions or even femininity or passion but in the negative sense love and sorry pink can represent the opposite of love like hate or even immaturity the color brown tends to represent compassion and humility but in the negative sense the color brown can represent flesh or humanism doing something in the flesh doing something in your own strength without relying on God gold can represent refining or purity holiness even the glory of God but in the negative sense it can represent idolatry or defilement or immorality so it just depends again on the context of the dream if I have a dream that I'm wearing a gold hat that can indicate that guy is refining or purifying my thought life silver silver in the positive sense represents Redemption but silver in the negative aspect weapons that's legalism slavery or even domination black now most people would think that black is only negative in a dream but that's not necessarily so I've had dreams where black was either neutral or in the positive sense it could represent death to self so in that sense positively black can represent those two things negatively black would represent sin it could represent death it could represent famine so the next time you have colors in your dreams don't ignore them God is sending you a message by using the colors I hope you enjoyed this talk on colors and dreams if you have any questions or comments please feel free

day here at the tech source headquarters because today I'm building a set up from scratch it has been a fat minute since I've done any set up videos on the channel if you guys remember the last one I did was back in October of 2019 which was a minimalistic gaming setup so make sure to check that out by the way in case you missed it so what setup are we building today you might ask well if you read the title then you probably already know so the idea behind this video originally came from LG when they sent over their new LG gram laptop and sponsor this video they asked me if I could build a set up using their new laptop and at first I was a bit hesitant because I thought to myself I don't think a laptop setup would be interesting for you guys so I thought of a better idea not only will I be building a set up using a laptop but I'll be building a gaming setup as well so this is going to be a hybrid setup for a laptop and PC gaming featuring my new sexy minimalistic PC I built on the channel if you guys missed this video definitely check it out I'll drop a link to it below but I had so much fun building this thing [Music] before we begin I will give huge thanks to surf sharp VPN

nice balance between the two so I did what any normal person would do on their quarantine and I went on Amazon and ordered a bunch of stuff so we're gonna build a set up from start to finish and honestly I have no idea how it's gonna turn out at the end I do have a vision in my mind but as you guys have seen in the past it could look like hot garbage or it could look really good it could go either way at this point so I didn't purchase anything too expensive I did my best to kind of keep the budget as reasonable as possible to kind of fit the theme in case you guys haven't noticed the theme is gonna be mostly black with some orange accents to kind of give it a little bit of life but anywho Z's undone rambling let's start putting together the desk so the desk we're going with is the popular linman tabletop during this quarantine a lot of stuff on IKEA was actually sold out so this is pretty much the only desk that I could get shipped to me here in California we're gonna do some modding to the desk however because obviously the white is gonna go against the the black theme are going with nice the length is going to be perfect they think this is actually the 60 inch so 60 inch wide and 30 inch for the depth so the cool thing about these legs that you can actually adjust it to whatever height you want and they extend quite a bit and there's even markings on here so you can align all four legs equally alright step one complete I think I made this too tall oh my god I made this into a standing desk god dammit this would technically work too but I'm a little too tall for this and this is the max height that I can put this desk on so unfortunately we have to lower it down a little bit alright so I got this awesome looking glossy black wood vinyl from Amazon and I'm gonna be skinning the entire table - obviously match the color scheme but before we do that I want to know where all the peripherals are gonna go because we're gonna be drilling some holes and they're obviously for cable management stuff so so I went ahead and put majority of the parts that we're gonna be using in the setup in the correct spots to kind of get a visual idea of where everything goes that way I can map out the blueprints of the setup a quick tip I can give you guys if you're trying to improve your setup is focus on these two things spacing and symmetry believe it or not these two things can really improve the overall aesthetics of your setup I'm gonna show you guys a quick example okay so we got the gaming monitor in the center I will be using this as the measuring point if you will next to that we got let's say a fake IKEA plan for decoration and then on the opposite side we got the wireless charger so as you guys can see it's kind of balanced we got something on this side and we got some being on this side and then as we move further outside we got the gaming PC on one and on the opposite side we got the natural self lamp technically it's not symmetrical because it's not the exact same object on both sides but you guys get the idea we're balancing something with another object on the opposite side another thing to keep in mind is spacing make sure all the objects on your setup have the equal amount of spacing this is what I mean by that let's say I have the fake IKEA plant really close to the PC on one side and then we have the charging dock further away from the object on the far left as you guys can see the spacing between the objects are noticeable and it will affect the aesthetics of your setup so try and do your best to keep the spacing even between all your objects you'll make a difference so this is the wireless Qi charger we're gonna be using so I'm gonna put this over here and then Julie hole let's say in the back over here so anywhere in this area alright so I picked up this cable grommet from Amazon so what I'm gonna do is drill a hole that's pretty much the same size so I can cover up with this cable grommet so I've got my drill bit hooked up to a I'm just gonna call it a your hole cutter I've no idea the neighbors oh look at that oh one thing I love about Ikea desk is how easy it is to drill holes in because most of it's made out of just plywood so here's my table grommet perfect fit look at that I'm gonna run our cable through lock this in place that way there ladies and gentlemen is how you do proper cable management for a charging duct so next thing you do is drill a hole that's gonna be wide enough to pass through the entire cable a common mistake that I've seen a lot of people do is that they only measure the hole to be wide enough for the USB but they completely disregard this portion over here in some peripherals I've actually seen this portion I don't know what this is exactly but it's a lot wider than the USB so when they try and pass through the cable it doesn't fit because they completely forgot about this portion of the cable so make sure you guys are measuring the widest part of the cable in this case it is the USB so that is how wide we got to make our hole so here's one inch one inch is definitely too wide let's see 4 3/4 3/4 is perfect we don't need to drill a hole that's wider than we need to so you know try and keep it as accurate as possible so 3/4 is gonna be perfect for this also guys do not do a hole in your mousepad the hole is for your desk what I'm gonna do here is actually just a slit wide enough to pass through the cable so I'm gonna be using a box cutter just gonna poke slit a hole wide enough to pass through the cable see this is way more noticeable compared to Julian massive hole in it there you go so easy that was all right so since the cables gonna go through here we can actually mark it through the mousepad there it is so now it's time to drill a hole you guys can use a Philo or sandpaper to kind of smooth in the edges if you want that is up to you but I'm gonna go ahead and skip that step here's my USB cable get a pass it through the mousepad into the hole plug it into the keyboard but as close as possible to the slit and there you go nobody suspects a thing now I want to do something to spice up the keyboard a little bit because right now it's kind of just blending in with a mousepad I want it to pop a little bit and we do have some orange accents around the setup so I thought we can switch up some key caps so I went on this website called bang good I'm guessing good bang was taken so and I picked up some key caps from the company called Becker I don't know wants to deal with these brand names but you know I don't make the rules here so we got some pretty sweet key caps that are compatible with the anthro too as you can see we got some orange ones on here some white and I think gunmetal gray with orange text on here so I think it's gonna look pretty sick once we swap these out [Music] so now that we have all the holes drilled in the desk and we pretty much know where everything goes it's time to scan the desk now I can leave the desk alone and not skin it because personally I think white looks pretty clean and it actually worked up this setup because of the key caps and stuff but I'm gonna skin it anyways just for the sake of trying something different you know I did purchase this anyways from Amazon so why not give it a shot after all we are trying different things and it might even look even better than the white soap [Music] next thing we're to do is Mount the monitor to the desk this is the monitor I did a review on actually a month ago I think the 27-inch gaming monitor from LG 240 Hertz refresh rate one millisecond response time on an IPS panel I beast of a monitor and it's gonna be perfect for not only productivity but gaming as well all right this actually goes really well with the theme was actually moves pretty fluidly nice so this is the amount they're gonna be using for a laptop it's from a flexi mounts and this works with up to I think 17 inch laptops so it's perfect for the LG Graham let me know you guys are enjoying the series so far by dropping a like or a dislike at this point and you guys want to see more types of videos I guess let me know the comments section because I really enjoy building set up some scratch the only issue with it is it takes a long time as you guys probably imagine one thing I like about this mount compared to the other one is that they actually give you anti rubber slip mats to cover the clamp area that way doesn't scratch or damage your desk so I'm gonna cover this portion over here this is also gonna prevent the mount from moving around or slipping around oh this one just kind of goes over the clamp like this so we're gonna mount this on the side of the desk I'm not exactly sure where just yet I might even actually end up putting it in the back here but I feel like the armor is too far so it's gonna go on the side for sure so there are two ways you can mount this on the arm the first way is vertical so let's say if you have a tablet or an iPad you can mount it this way to kind of use it as a secondary display or you can mount it 45-degree angle which is what we're gonna be doing because we are obviously going to be using this with a laptop and then we can use the mount to kind of adjust the angle it's time for the Himalayan salt lamp as you guys know this is an anti RGB setup so I thought we could include a little bit of lighting so there's one major thing that this set up is missing can you guys guess what that is it's kind of storage space obviously we're going with a minimalistic setup but it's also nice to have some storage space so we can store miscellaneous items or accessories to keep the surface of the desk very clean that is where this comes in I picked up a pencil drawer from Amazon and we're gonna install this on the bottom of the desk alright the holes are marked now it's time it's like that we're done so guys here is what I set up looks like so far I am loving how it's turning out but no setup is complete without you guessed it through rumors room which i think is one of the most important parts of any setup now obviously you can have an awesome looking setup with flashy RGB lighting high-end pcs and high-end gear but if you have you know you can have an awesome you know you can have an awesome looking setup with flashy RGB lighting and high-end gear but if you have cables hanging out everywhere like mom's sphaghetti then obviously it's gonna affect the look of your setup so I'm gonna give you guys some tips on how to improve your cable management by kind of going through my thought process of cable managing this setup if you guys want some more info on cable management as well I did a video on it actually I think over 4 or 5 years ago which is still relevant today I'll drop a link to that on the top right corner so make sure to check that out as well but anyways the first step is obviously to plug in all your cables so that way we can have an idea of where everything is coming out of so I'm going to start off with the PC and then work our way to the monitor I'm gonna be hooking up the HDMI for the laptop and then we're going DisplayPort for the PC that way we can take advantage of the 240 Hertz or fresh weight of the monitor and then here's where I HDMI coming from the monitor to the laptop so the next step is to figure out the main source of hiding your cables are you going to install a rack underneath the table and just dump your cables on that are you gonna use a cable box to hide your power strip or are you gonna mount everything under the bottom of your desk so that is step one so we're just out to set up we're gonna be using a single power strip and we're gonna plug everything inside here and mount it on the bottom of our desk so the way we're gonna route the cables is by using a channel Raceway and the reason why I like these separate ones instead of the one long one is that we can separate them so you can put them anywhere we want giving us way more flexibility so the first thing we're gonna do is kind of see where we can mount the power strip make sure it's in a location where everything can plug-in from your setup so this is for the PC here's the power for the monitor and of course you've got the salt lamp as long as it's in a location where all the plugs can reach it then you're pretty much good to go but what I like to do is kind of position it closer to one of the corners and I'm going to use this leg and route the power strip cable right behind it so before we attach the power strip on the bottom of the desk we got attached some 3m tape this is actually a very common mistake that I've seen a lot of people doing is that they don't use strong enough double-sided tape to hold their power strip depending on how heavy your power strip is you need to use the appropriate 3m tape so for this one I'm using VHP by three and this is actually one of the strongest adhesive tapes you can find online make sure you guys are using this if you're attaching power brakes power strips or anything that's heavy underneath your desk so for this one we're gonna need about three put one in the center and we're gonna put the last one on the bottom here just make sure you guys are spacing it evenly why don't here's good okay apply some pressure make sure it sticks on there real good and for the time being we can plug the stuff in the power strip all right the next thing I like to do is kind of manage some of the cables that are hanging down like this because you know we can't have things sagging right it just doesn't look good so this is actually the keyboard cable that's being plugged into the back of the PC so we're gonna use some of these cable clips and we're gonna attach one to the cable and just stick it somewhere up here what I like to do is keep a straight path because it is the most aesthetically pleasing you don't want to go across or dab you know you want to keep the cables as straight and parallel as possible with the rest of the stuff underneath the desk so here's one anything over here is again see how we have a straight path coming from the hole straight to the back so next thing we're to do is install these channel Raceway this is gonna help us throughout our cables much cleaner they're called channel raceways because we're obviously channeling the cable through here so typically they come with only one double-sided tape but I like to add another layer so depending on the length of your desk you might have to use a few of these but because we were using a somewhat normal-sized desk I think two is enough for this so before you stick this on the bottom of your desk run the cable through the Raceway and just kind of figure out where you want to place this that way it makes more sense to you over here's good again make sure that everything is parallel and I'll basically do the same thing for the second one so here's the other Raceway make sure it aligns with the other Raceway all right so now we still have our keyboard cable right we're obviously going to try and hide this so what we're gonna do is run this through the waste way as well we do have this one cable in the middle which is kind of loose and instead of putting a little Raceway on there which i think is unnecessary we can just use another cable clip to keep it from sagging all right there's good all right next thing I'm gonna do is the remote for the lamp obviously I still want to be able to control the brightness so what I'm gonna do is attach double sided tape on the bottom of this and then stick this as close as I can to the front of the desk like wide over here that's as far as the cable can go so I'm gonna hook this up right over here it's still gonna be within reach and I can use it to adjust the brightness and for this part we're just gonna use another cable clip to kind of tighten it up a bit put one right there and then we'll go put one right over here and here's the monitor cable we're gonna route this also through the Raceway and into the power strip again guys any excess cables you can use cable clips to kind of prevent it from hanging or you can hide them back inside the channel raceway doesn't really matter all right now let's manage the cable sticking out from the PC so we're gonna be using these thick boy cable clips instead and then we're gonna hook it up to the side of the desk like that and then for this corner part I'm just gonna vote for the cables together all right and finally for the DisplayPort cable we're gonna actually run this from the back of the desk so here's our final cable clip I'm gonna route this around like this and obviously to keep the cable from moving around we're just gonna tie it with a velcro strap so we have one final cable you guys the HDMI for the laptop and this is actually the most trickiest one because we do have the laptop moving around so we can't keep it too short otherwise it will kink and we can't keep it too long otherwise there's gonna be a lot of cable slack so you got to find the sweet spot you got the perfect amount of slack to move the laptop around so one of the reasons why I wanted to fount the power step closer to the edge of the desk is so we can hide the cable behind the legs and then we can use a velcro strap I just notice that these legs were black it would have blend in with the velcro straps a lot better but oh well not a big deal so here's what the cables look like before and here's what the cable management looks like after everything's done so yeah definitely a huge improvement [Music] so ladies and gentlemen here is what the final setup looks like it took me four days to put all this together and I absolutely loved the way it turned out if I were to build a hybrid setup for laptop and PC gaming this is how I would have done it starting off with the star of the show the MVP my super compact minimalistic gaming PC recently built on the channel using the motive Monument open-air chassis if you guys missed the video definitely check it out it was an interesting one to watch I'll leave a link below or you can click on the top right I threw in the horizon 7 3,800 x8 core 16 thread processor in here with 16 gigs of ram and an r/t x 2060 graphics card take advantage of all that sweet sweet FPS is the LG gaming monitor it sports a 27 inch 1080p IPS display with a 240 Hertz of fresh rate and a 1 millisecond response time and since it is an IPS panel it's got great viewing angles and color accuracy which is great for any color sensitive work that I might be doing on either the PC or the laptop I do have this hooked up to my lg gram and I use it as a secondary display as well for peripherals I'm using the M Pro to 60% mechanical keyboard with custom PB Tiki caps from Becker I wanted to add a bit of color but not go overboard at the same time and since there are subtle orange accents throughout the setup I thought these key caps with fit beautifully in the color scheme I was going for for mice I wanted to give myself options I have the MX master 3 for productivity and the logitech g930 for gaming the hyper scroll wheel is an absolute must for me for scrolling through long pages quickly and the side scroll is super convenient while I'm editing videos but the mice doesn't do so well for gaming since it's a lot heavier and there is noticeable latency which is why I use the G 603 instead for gaming I did go with a wireless option to minimize cable clutter but also it's really comfortable to use I honestly can't tell the difference between a Wired gaming mouse and this that's how responsive the G 603 is in games now since the setup doesn't have any storage space I did install a pencil drawer underneath it to help store some of my things that I use on the Bailey for example I keep my other Mouse in here if I'm not using it along with the USB Drive and other missing yes items I also keep my WD black portable SSD in here the portable form factor is perfect for travel since I can take it with me when I'm on the go and I use this often to transfer files between my laptop and the PC also it saves me lots of space on my PC because I have all of my games installed on here I have a USBC cable running underneath the desk that's plug straight into the PC so all I have to do is plug it in and launch the game straight from the SSD I actually have my editing program installed on here as well so I run the program through the SSD while I'm using the LG gramme this way it runs much faster and I don't use up any extra storage from the laptop also I did buy a wireless charger for my iPhone because obviously I like having my phone fully charged all the time and this actually doubles as a stand which is great since I can easily glance over at the notifications without having to pick up my phone I'm sure you guys have noticed at this point that I have only one audio source now the main reason was because I didn't want to add any extra gear that I don't see myself using often these Amazon speakers are perfect and they are all I need for listening to music watching videos and even gaming they are tiny but mighty something my wife often tells me at night they pack a nice punch and they get pretty loud - I'm actually surprised with the quality of these given the price tag and finally for aesthetics I did add a fake IKEA plans to give it some color and a Himalayan salt lamp for that ambient lighting and I really think it brings the entire setup together I have the remote mounted underneath the desk so I can control the brightness or shut it off completely if I want it's also said that having a Himalayan salt lamp can provide some health benefits but I'm not really sure if any of that is true either way it looks nice in the setup so everything in the setup has synergy and works really well together I can easily transition between using a laptop and the PC the keyboard has a Bluetooth option which is hooked up to the laptop by default so all I have to do is switch it on from underneath the keyboard and it automatically connects to it same with the MX master 2 3 Mouse I just changed a connection on the bottom and I'm already connected to the laptop the only other thing I will need to do is change the display output from the monitor to HDMI to switch over to the laptop I really wanted to buy an HDMI switcher that way I can just press a button and then switch between the laptop and the monitor button for there's nothing out there that supports high refresh rate monitors I think the highest one was sixty Hertz so would have capped my monitor and it would have severely bottleneck my awesome gaming PC so if I'm using the lg monitor as the main display I like switching over to the lg gram and using that as a secondary display for example if I'm editing a video on the PC I like to glance over to the lg gram and look up things without having to alt-tab the laptop mount that I've installed is really flexible so I can pretty much position it any way I like for convenience I wish the stand was a bit sturdy as it does wobble quite a bit while typing but like I said I mostly use it as a secondary display now if I'm using the LG Graham as the main PC I place it in front of me and plug in a second HDMI cable which I have attached underneath the desk for convenience this allows me to work straight from the laptop and use the LG monitor as a secondary display one of the things I love about the LG Graham is how light it is making it the perfect laptop to travel with not to mention the old a battery life I get with it so yeah this is pretty much my minimalistic hybrid setup that I put together in four days but you know what guys it's time for you to rate my setup you know I judge setups every Monday on setup Wars so I think it's only fair that you guys judge mine let me know the comments section if there's anything you didn't like about it or if there's something that you would change and do something differently whatever it is let me know your feedback in the comment section and finally please give me a rating out of 10 be as honest as possible should be interesting and of course all the gear used for the setup will be linked down below if any of you want to check that out but if you guys enjoyed these setup type videos let me know by leaving a simple like and maybe comment below on what setup I should build for the next episode I love your beautiful faces as always I will see you very soon in the next one", "1UQI3fpOHMI": "hey everybody Andy here with macdanne cannabis review oregon cannabis reviews and i got another product to show you so check it out here i have with me is some snoop stream this is Blue Dream and Master Kush crossed leaning more on the indica sides this is going to be more of like a body high and this one is from collective awakenings and beautiful but beautiful beautiful blood oh it's just really really like a lime green color with bright orange hairs it's got a super like sweet piney berry smell to it and I love it even the container still reeks this one is 22 percent THC with 1.93 percent CBD okay CBD is a lot of the medical aspects of marijuana if you don't know what CBD is I highly recommend you pause this video go google it do some research on it and then come back to this video and continue this review I don't really have a whole lot of time to explain a CBD but it is like a lot of the medical aspects it's more of like the body high and stuff like that so the fact that this has a little bit of CBD in it is they're actually really good because a lot of strains out there don't have any CBD in it they're the ones that usually have some CBD usually have very low THC so the fact that this is 22% TAC with almost 2% CBD it's actually fairly good believe it or not so go ahead and give a piece here and I'm gonna go out take this little nutty right here let me break this guy open don't do that even even better wow that's just you know those like fully developed adult like trichomes that are like deep and they just glisten even then we even need light you know you don't have to shine no light on you can just see it that's the kind of trikes that are on this and it's just amazing it shines it's beautiful it's dense so I mean it is super dense but it's not that heavy dense you know what I mean it's not where it's gonna really break you on the scale it's like fluffy dense like the nug is really compact but it's not super heavy which is really good that's actually how I prefer my my bud personally for me I like it where it's that's compact and you know nice solid nug but it doesn't weigh super much so you can get a good amount of it on the scale but that's just me everybody's preferences are different start up the torch up Wow you get that solid taste through throwing through it's got a nice berry taste in the beginning with a nice sweet after tone and I love that sweet after Tony sticks with it like it still tasted in my mouth yeah that's got a nice a nice heart to it I can feel it in my back for someone like me who has fibromyalgia I mean that really feels great it's got a nice hi to it this is a big that I would recommend for chronic pain of stress depression insomnia I mean even appetite probably just it's got that indica in it so I would imagine here in a little bit I'm probably going to have the munchies and want to go get something to eat Wow that was good but no it's really good I really enjoyed that and we got this from collective awakening sandy Boulevard in Portland Oregon great dispensary they got a nice selection of top-quality but highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already all right my rating on the snoop stream right here is that easy 4 out of 5 stars easily almost 5 like pretty much almost for 1/2 if it was a little more potent I would be definitely 5 hands down but I mean a nice about four or four and a half is where I'm gonna put it at and it's I'm gonna say four and a half I'm gonna put it that way just because I mean the taste is great the highest potent and if what puts it over that little half I mean the nuns are are dense and just nice structure and everything to them and what puts it over in that half is the fact that it's got that little bit of CBD in there that's what's gonna give me the half four so four and a half stars if you guys this is something to go check out okay if you know uh Mick DANC rating system this is something to definitely go check out okay it's definitely worth whatever gas to go drive and go get some where from wherever you're at go check out collective awakening snoop dream it's really good strain and I'll be definitely revisiting collective awakenings again and getting some more all right I also like how they gave me like a point over a gram so they're like make sure this is a gram I like that there's this little add-on alright so go check out snoops dream it is blue dream and Master Kush hybrid and it is a really good strain if you like something that's sweet and fruity that's the strain check out and really really recommend it four and a half stars from collective awakenings in Portland Oregon alright guys Andy with macdanne cannabis review please subscribe to our channel

blaze before don't get me wrong i've tried it i don't think i've made a video on it but i've tried stevie's um but yes i'll be playing a video right now but this is their tier two stuff i thought that 710 labs and and like uh rosin companies really do the tier one tier two tier three stuff so uh i was surprised that this company did it and i'm gonna tell you my original thoughts on this company when i tried stevie's was just some generic crc [ __ ] um this one slightly tastes like that but with uh like something more i don't know how to say it but this was actually 25 out the door and was recommended to me by the budtender shout out to the homie he said he watches my videos um but for 25 dollars uh for a tier two this i mean it's comparable to some bear labs that i've had but honestly i'd pay four more dollars for some bear labs um but yeah here it is i'll play the video right here it is uh when only the best will do all that stuff you actually rip these corners right here to open it but the it is a thin mint batter it's total cannabinoids of 88.62 thca is 77.89 thc 74.11 and cbd point eleven percent and then batch id all that stuff uh fairly new packaging about two months ago um but yeah i'll be playing it uh if you didn't see it in the video it's gonna be right here as well very uh he did say it was a batter i would say it smells a lot better than uh it tastes but the taste isn't bad i mean it's like crc the taste isn't bad it's just very generic and very it's all over the place you know what i'm saying like i've had many brands taste the same thing and it's just like so we're gonna be hitting it out of the dip you guys are probably wondering why i've only been using the dip i am a one device guy i've mentioned this many times you only have i mean i have a lot of devices as of today you know as of me getting them but when you just use one device you only get to clean one device you know what i'm talking about and if you're using like one every day it's just more for you to clean you know and i for one don't really like cleaning even though you must you must i can't stress that enough you must um i would say clean this every [ __ ] three days you know but you know what i'm talking about i just i just like to use one device but i have many devices for different situations i have the eno if i want to take a fat dab you know what i'm saying i have the smoke scene in case this one is out of battery i have the the dab x you know in case i want to be taking a dab and i only got a bong you know so this is awake and bake as well so we are going to be packing it back so let that melt down there taking a while but it's getting there all right so this is thin mints i don't know if i mentioned it cheers so like i said the very the very taste of crc that creamy that creaminess to it but there's a little something extra to it that you know it's very different from crc but for for its price 25 i definitely would get something else cool but definitely not bad this is the first time me smoking today so the effects are going to be as as pure i don't know as um oh don't ruin that again i'm interested in knowing if there's actually uh tier three in this maybe it's a lot better maybe i'll consider buying it i don't know but yeah i mean here it is right here i actually do have some other wax it's west coast here i believe and it's diamonds so be on the lookout for that video as well put that down there let's get some fat hits for you guys cheers usually i have my fan off let me turn it off it's affecting the smoke and i'm saying her the cloud but yeah let me know if you've tried cali blaze uh like i said i've tried their tier one stuff um they're tier two stuff it's all right and um yeah i don't know cheers though oh i should hit all right that's about it for this video as i'm cleaning this not the greatest tasting wax um i would have thought for tier two it would have tasted a little bit some extra you know what i'm saying like i don't know i don't know what i was expecting but it's definitely not i don't know for their tier one and their tier two to kind of taste the same it means it says something you know i don't know um but let me know if you've tried a good kelly blaze as far as like like i said the crc taste is not bad but when you're buying you know strains or a brand different brands and they're all tasting that same type of [ __ ] taste it kind of just gets to you but at the end of the day it's not a bad taste you know some people probably like that taste but this does have a little bit something extra on there i don't know what to exactly say it is but it's like crc and more i don't know but hopefully you did enjoy this video um like the video if you did enjoy it i'll see you guys

Toyota rav4 is a hybrid and pumps out less co2 than a one liter Ford Fiesta and in this review we're going to tell you what the real-world fuel economy is like what it's like to live with and everything you need to know about this car and before we get started make sure you are subscribed to our youtube channel so that you catch all of our great videos and if you're interested in buying one of these then right now at what caram you get a thousand pounds off so the rav4 sits above the CHR and below the rough and ready Land Cruiser in Toyotas lineup and being a hybrid it stands out and what that means it's got a petrol powered motor as well as an electric motor to power it along and cut fuel consumption in the process is a five seater and roughly the same size as a Honda CRV which is its closest competitor because that is also a hybrid but it does face some stiff competition from some conventionally powered cars such as the Mazda cx-5 Peugeot 5008 and Skoda Kodiak and this is another new Toyota that has very interesting styling this rav4 is certainly a lot more striking than its fairly bland predecessor it's also different in many other ways to the previous generation now it should be more comfortable better to drive and nicer inside what do you think of its looks we have a poll and we would love to have your vote which car do you think is the best-looking out of the Toyota rav4 Mazda cx-5 Peugeot 5008 and the Citroen c5 err cross slip inside the rav4 and the interior looks smart and relatively plush definitely more so than Honda CRV which has a lot more hard scratchy plastics we really like the look and feel and quality of these dials and the rubberized bit here just reminds you that you're in a rugged SUV if you want a bit more of a visual spectacle they need to go for the Peugeot 5008 which is a lot more striking and makes this actually look quite plain and if you want something a bit more classy than the Skoda Kodiak and Mazda cx-5 both deliver in that respect but overall this is well put together and does look pretty good all drivers should be able to get comfortable because there's plenty of adjustment in the seat and steering well you also sit very high up so you get a great commanding view of the road and you can see well because this pillar is are quite thin and we have a very large armrest here which is great for those long motorway halls and you get parking sensors and a reversing camera as standard however there is one clear weakness in this interior and it's the infotainment system the first problem is the hardware because the eight-inch touchscreen is quite low in definition with small buttons that take some strong prodding to select the operating system isn't especially user-friendly and takes a while to get your head round all of this is far worse than rival systems such as the one you get in the Kodiak the worst thing about this system though is that there's no smartphone mirroring such as apple carplay or android auto so you can't use your screen on your phone up here which means you really are stuck with it now in terms of space it's not quite as spacious as the Honda CRV but there is still quite a lot of room at the front here so very very tall people will be absolutely fine and we've got two cupholders here and we've got a very large cubby and a useful tray there and somewhere for your mobile phone but remember you can't look at it you can't hold it and you also can't look at it on there so actually I think my put it into a box that is a reasonable size and there's enough room for my fairly large bottle to fit in korban although they could be a little bigger now the rav4 is a large car so you are not going to be haunted by moans of disgruntled rear passengers through lack of space because there's definitely enough room there's slightly more in a Honda CRV and slightly less in a Mazda cx-5 so it kind of sits in between the two and because it is so spacious you can easily fit kids seats too in fact and still manage to fit in between if you're not particularly big the rav4 based a bigger booth and most of its rivals in fact it will fit ten carry-on suitcases which is more than we've got in there at the moment we've just got a little bit of camera equipment and a pair of brown high heels because of course one pair is not enough anyway that is one more than its rival the CRV and two more than the cx-5 and then if you fold down the rear seats you get an enormous load way and no load lip which means uploading bulky items in and out is a doddle but how expensive is a Toyota rav4 and what's the real world fuel economy like these are the things you need to know about buying and owning one the extra technology and hybrid cars makes them more expensive to build so they don't always seem like bargains there are cheaper options available for example the Mazda cx-5 and the Peugeot 5008 but it is priced in line with its closest rival the Honda CRV hybrid and even though the list price might seem a little high equipment levels are very impressive all models get adaptive cruise control dual-zone climate control and lots more but we'd still step up to design trim because there adds front parking sensors and sat-nav the rav4 is the cheapest company car of its rivals thanks to tiny co2 emissions plus it offers impressive fuel economy in two-wheel drive guys the rav4 in our true MPG tes achieved 49 miles per gallon but a Honda CRV Hybrid is even more impressive still it's unlikely that you'll need to worry about your rav4 breaking down because Toyota has a fantastic reliability record but as a backup it's good to know you get a hundred thousand mile warranty or five years which is better than many of its rivals the rav4 has received an excellent rating from Euro endcap not only does it get the full five stars overall but it also scores highly in each of the individual categories racking up some of the highest scores in the class better than rivals including the Peugeot 5008 Mazda cx-5 and Honda CRV in other words it's one of the safest cars in the large SUV class the rav4 is a regular hybrid which means it doesn't need plugging in which also means it's Fenian oh we're in electric mode that is fantastic I was just about to criticize it and say that you'll only get a few hundred yards but I'm traveling at 15 miles an hour and it is an e V mode which is really really satisfying because it's very nice and relaxing but if you put your foot down slightly and get up to the speed limit that's it the two and a half litre petrol engine has now kicked in so you're best off leaving it in normal mode instead of evey because then the car can decide for itself whether it wants to select electric mode or conventional powered acceleration isn't to shoving you get that almost instant power that you get from an electric vehicle which means joining a roundabout or overtaking is a breeze the two-wheel drive model does naught to 60 in 8.4 seconds and the four-wheel drive thanks to that extra little bit of traction does it fractionally quicker in 8.1 seconds ride comfort may not be the Toyota rav4 strongest suit it does thud over potholes slightly which is not what you quite expect from a family car a Honda CRV feels a lot more settled around town and a Peugeot 5008 is more comfortable still the round Ford disappoints with its handling - it never feels particularly willing to change direction quickly thanks to its large weight and rolling into the corners admittedly hybrids rarely handlers tidally as pure petrol and diesel cars because of the extra weight of their batteries and electric motors but the CRV Hybrid feels more stable through tight twists and turns and has more naturally weighted steering - now in normal driving because of its hybrid setup it feels relatively harsh compared with its petrol and diesel rivals but put your foot down and the petrol engine kicks in and it just sounds like you're stuck in first gear and it's because of that CVT gearbox and it only eases off when you use the revs off it's not a particularly relaxing experience so the Toyota rav4 is fairly ordinary to drive but its strong points lie elsewhere it's real selling points are costs sure it's more expensive to buy than a lot of other large SUVs but you should make that up further down the line when it comes to its resale values and if you're a company car driver it will be one of the cheapest large SUVs to run because of the cheap company car tax and remember if you're thinking about buying one there's a thousand pounds off right now if you go to what card comm and also you will find our full online written review of this car and its rivals and before you go anywhere remember hit subscribe and never miss

welcome to the CUBE Bikes Showroom here in Waldershof. We're here to give you a look at the \ndifferent bike categories for the 20/21 model year. My colleague Peter will talk about our Hybrid bikes, but we'll begin with a quick tour of our conventional bikes. After the success of our aluminium Nuroad, we quickly realised we needed to level up our \ngravel series with a carbon version of the same platform. Again, the name C:62 tells you that we work \nwith a higher fibre content of 62% in this composite. The Nuroad C:62 has loads of lovely \ndetails like this semi-integrated seat clamp \u2013 the same one we use on our Agree series \u2013 and a full carbon fork with \nhidden cable routing for a front light. These bikes are designed for performance, but the carbon version also includes \nall interfaces for our ACID accessories. It means I can use it as a carbon race bike or upgrade it with mudguards, \nrack and a kickstand for great practicality. For the top-end SL version we fitted 1x12 SRAM Force gears. These are combined with mountain bike components. So we have the SRAM Eagle rear derailleur \nand cassette which give a massive gear range \u2013 great for really steep climbs. It has clearance for up to 45 mm tyres. Or 40 mm if mudguards are fitted. This is a hugely capable and versatile \nbike for a wide variety of applications. The appeal and popularity of gravel \nbikes is down to their supreme versatility. They cover a huge field of application and \nrepresent something different for every rider. The Nuroad is a gravel bike that does it all, \nfrom an evening training ride to the daily commute or a multi-day bikepacking tour. We completely redesigned the Nuroad's \naluminium frame for the 20/21 model year. Not only is it lighter, it's also more elegant. You can see it has a fully integrated seatpost clamp. The full carbon fork was slimmed down to around just 450 g. It includes features like hidden cable \nrouting for a front light, like on this FE model. We added all the necessary mounting points to attach a \nkickstand, mudguards and luggage rack from the ACID accessory range. Or you can buy it fully loaded like this version here. Take off the accessories and the mounting \npoints are barely visible on the bare bike. We really focussed on sleek, slimline optics. This model is specced with Shimano GRX. That's Shimano's gravel-specific groupset. The brakes are designed to offer a \ncomfortable position on the handlebars. And the gear range is chosen with climbing in mind \n\u2013 even with luggage on board. This fork can carry an extra 10 kg on a lowrider rack. Add it all together and the Nuroad \nis a genuine long-distance expedition bike. The gravel boom is in full swing and women \nare discovering the appeal of going off road. That's why we completely redesigned \nour Nuroad WS for the 20/21 model year. It has an all-new aluminium frame. We made significant weight savings of around 200 g to 300 g. We also slimmed down the full carbon fork to 1 \u215b in and 1 \u00bc in. And you see here we added mounting points for a \nlowrider rack that can carry an extra 10 kg on the front wheel. All the other mounting points are included \nfor full compatibility with our ACID accessories so I can upgrade it with a kickstand, mudguards and luggage rack. It works with both the spring clamp rack \n\u2013 which is great for commuting \u2013 or the pared-down version if you're carrying panniers. That also makes it ideal for bikepacking trips. The bike is specced with a \nwide-ranging 2x10 Shimano Tiagra transmission. We also fitted mechanical TRP disc \nbrakes for outstanding stopping power. It has clearance for up to 45 mm tyres. Or 40 mm with mudguards, so there's still plenty of \nscope for added safety and comfort when riding fully laden. If we look at bikes with drop bars, \nthere are two clear trends emerging: gravel and cyclocross. For CUBE, these areas are an important part of its athlete sponsorship. We travel to all the national and international \nUCI World Cup events and also support development teams. For the 20/21 model year we completely \nredesigned our aluminium Cross Race frame. The frame is slimmer and lighter than ever. We're talking about savings of 200 g to 300 g. We also slimmed down the fork. Thru-axles were added front and rear and the geometry \nis more performance oriented compared to gravel bikes. Let's take a look at the Cross Race C:62 \u2013 C:62 means this bike has a carbon frame. \n62 stands for the fibre content in the composite. The frame weighs just 1100 g. It also comes with a full carbon fork. The top-of-the range model, the SLT, goes even further. It has a carbon wheelset from NEWMEN. These are the latest generation in \nR38 carbon rims with internal nipples. The cockpit is also from NEWMEN. We have carbon bars and a carbon seatpost. And the SLT is specced with \nSRAM Force AXS for completely wireless shifting. Many of our performance-oriented bikes now come with \n1x12 gears which not only perform better but are incredibly light. And of course a bike built for \nspeed needs to be able to stop safely, which is why we fitted SRAM Force hydraulic disc brakes. The Litening is our ultimate high-performance road \nmachine and the fastest bike from CUBE on the road today. The aerodynamic tube profiles \nmake it look quite bulky from the side. But the frontal area is reduced to the \nabsolute minimum. This is a really slim bike. It's built to UCI rules, \nright down to the last detail. This bike has ridden the Tour de France. Reducing drag is of course the biggest factor. This frame saves 30% compared to its predecessor \n\u2013 and the wind tunnel tests confirm it. That's a genuine saving of 30 watts with this model. Riders will definitely feel the difference! The top-of-the-range SLT model takes it to the \nextreme with carbon wheels that further reduce drag. These are super aero 62 mm deep-section wheels. What you generally see is that \nthere's nothing really to see any more. The brake cables are completely hidden and this top-end SLT model here is specced \nwith SRAM Red AXS for completely wireless shifting. The handlebars and stem are an integrated system. The frame, fork, handlebars and stem were designed \nas one unit to ensure smooth transitions and reduce drag. But this bike isn't just for pro athletes \n\u2013 it's for everyone, which is why we made it compatible with up to 28 mm tyres. This is perfect if you want to add a little bit \nmore volume and comfort for riding on badly paved roads. The secret to the Stereo 150's success: 29 in wheels, \na full carbon frame and a lot of suspension travel. It's capable enough to handle EWS-winning performances yet \nlight enough to be fun on evening loops or multi-day mountain adventures. The TM version doesn't only come in this \neye-catching orange and grey colour scheme to match the TM spec, it's also been fitted with even \nsturdier components to live up to its TM badge. We've got the latest-generation FOX Factory chassis \nwith a Float X2 shock and the brand-new Fox 36 fork. 160 mm of travel up front and 150 mm at the rear. Then there's the robust, super-stiff NEWMEN SLA30 wheels. These are shod with the grippy MAXXIS Assegai \nat the front and the Minion DHR2 at the back. Magura MT7 brakes with a 203 mm front rotor and 180 mm rear serve up plenty of stopping power to keep the \ncapable chassis under control on fast descents. The Sting WS 140 models integrate all the \nbenefits of a 27.5 in trail or all mountain bike. The HPC badge means it has a carbon main frame and carbon rocker. That makes it both stiffer and lighter. We combined it here with an aluminium rear triangle. 27.5 in wheels give it a really \nnimble, responsive and agile chassis. The Race version comes with \na full Fox setup with a 150 mm Fox 34 fork up front and the 140 mm Float DPS shock at the rear. We added even more stopping power in the \nform of the Magura 4-piston front brake. At the back we fitted the 2-piston version to save weight. The Fulcrum wheels with 27 mm \ninner rim width are tubeless-ready. We deliberately chose Shimano's 1x12 transmission. It's easy to use and comes with a 10-51-tooth cassette. That's a gear range of 510%, which gives me a small \nenough gear to grind up those steep mountain ascents. At CUBE, Elite C:68X is the undisputed \nstar of cross-country and marathon racing. These bikes need to be light and stiff, that's obvious. \nBut we also wanted to incorporate maximum comfort into the frame. You can see here it has a very slimline profile. The seat stays, top tube and seatpost work together like a \nmini suspension system to make long rides less tiring on the rider. The C:68X badge means a 68% fibre content. \nThe X stands for the removal of surplus material. X always means that we've focussed on \nthe essentials and removed any excess. The range-topping SLT model comes \nwith the best components available. We have a full SRAM Eagle XX1 AXS groupset with wireless shifting. We have super-light and reliable Magura MT8 brakes. And for suspension we have a 100mm Fox Factory fork. I can lock the fork directly using the handlebar-mounted \nlever to ensure every last watt goes into my sprint. The CUBE Analog is the perfect bike to \ndiscover the world of mountain bike trails. It's designed for you to just \njump on, head off road and have fun! We included everything you'd \nexpect to find on a proper mountain bike. The frame is built from butted aluminium. It's both light and stiff. The smaller frame sizes come with 27.5 in wheels and the \nlarger frames, like this one here, are with 29 in wheels. This bike has a 100mm RockShox fork with remote lockout. \nIt lets me lock the fork from my handlebars if I want to sprint. I have 1x12 SRAM Eagle gears. Unimaginable a couple of years ago, but these 1x gears \nhave a huge range going up to a 50-tooth cog at the back. That's small enough for even really steep climbs. And on high-speed descents I can rely on the powerful Shimano \nhydraulic disc brakes to shave speed and safely bring me to a stop. For the 20/21 model year CUBE has given \nthe entire Nature series a brand-new frame. Our goal was to reduce the weight \u2013 so for example we use hydroforming technology on the \nchain stays to make better use of the material and shave off grammes. We also changed the overall shape. All of the frames in this series \nhave clearance for up to 50 mm tyres. This significantly improves ride comfort and safety. You can see here the Nature SL has a full \nShimano XC groupset with 3x10 transmission and XC brakes. We also used a lighter suspension fork. We fitted an SR Suntour air fork that can be \ncontrolled from the handlebars via the remote lockout. This model is a cross between a classic and sporty \ntrekking bike, but I can also convert it into a touring bike. It has all the frame mounting \npoints to attach the ACID accessories. So I can upgrade with \na kickstand, luggage rack and mudguards. All the interfaces are cleanly integrated \ninto the frame to keep the sporty looks. The CUBE Hyde stands for urban mobility combined with sophisticated looks. The Hyde Pro model you see here takes it to \nanother level with the smooth and reliable Gates belt drive. It's virtually maintenance-free and incredibly quiet. The frame is specially designed for this system. There's an eccentric bottom bracket to adjust the belt tension. And the belt is removed via this split drop-out. You can see we added big-volume tyres from Schwalbe for extra comfort. It comes with a rigid fork that adds to the clean lines. We fitted Shimano 8-speed hub gears which offer a huge range. It's designed to be incredibly low maintenance all around. The hydraulic disc brakes are also from Shimano. As you can see, the bike looks super sleek but it includes \nJall the frame mounting points to make it compatible with ACID accessories. So it's simple to upgrade with a luggage rack, mudguards and kickstand\n\u2013 just add some panniers and you've really got the perfect commuter bike. The kids hitting the trails and bike parks with their parents \ntoday could be the World Cup racers and World Champions of tomorrow. At CUBE, it was clear to us that we needed to build them a \nfull-susser that meets all the same standards we expect of our adult bikes. The Stereo 240 comes with a 24 in chassis and 120 mm of travel front and rear. Its frame is built from HPA \u2013 High Performance Aluminium. We use hydroforming technology and butted tubing. The frame comes with a 142x12 thru-axle and we chose a crank length to suit junior riders. We also specced a kid-friendly ergonomic cockpit. The STG handlebars are fitted with narrower diameter grips. These offer better control for smaller hands. And the suspension is tuned to the lower rider weight. We use Manitou forks and shocks designed to \nuse the full range of travel with a lighter passenger on board. Big-volume Schwalbe tyres and Magura brakes provide safe, assured stopping. A fully-fledged mountain bike with 1x11 SRAM gears for the junior shredders of tomorrow. The Stereo 120 Hybrid is our comfort-oriented full-suspension bike. Also available this year in Size Split. Size XS comes with 27.5 in wheels \nthat offer optimal handling for smaller riders. The kinematics and chain stay length are tailored for comfort. The Stereo 120 is fully commuter ready with \nmounting points for a kickstand, mudguards and luggage rack. It also takes easy trails in its stride. This is the new Stereo 120 TM, designed specifically for flowing trails. We have 1x12 SRAM gears and reliable Magura brakes. There's a RockShox Recon fork up front, a crystal-clear Kiox display and tough \nSchwalbe Hans Dampf tyres with Supertrail casing. The Stereo 140 Hybrid is a true all-rounder. From long tours to enduro sessions, it does it all. Its updated geometry makes climbing just as fun as descending. Shorter chain stays than on the Stereo 120 Hybrid \nguarantee more agile handling without compromising on climbing ability. The front end stays planted on super-steep ascents. This year we geared the Stereo 140 SLT even more to performance. We upped the front-end suspension travel to \n150 mm and fitted a Fox Float DPX rear shock with reservoir. The fork is a Fox 36 Float Factory with the new Grip2 damper. SRAM AXS 1x12 wireless shifting and NEWMEN \ncarbon wheels make this a genuine high-end performance bike. The Stereo 160 Hybrid is our most downhill-oriented full-suspension bike. Its geometry and kinematics are tailored for maximum fun. Incredibly agile handling is courtesy of 27.5 in wheels and super-short chain stays. The range-topping Stereo 160 Hybrid SLT model comes with a full C:62 carbon frame for \nthe 20/21 model year, giving it a 25% lighter rear triangle. The speed sensor is now neatly integrated into the dropout. The signal is measured via a magnet attached to the brake rotor. We have SRAM AXS wireless shifting and a wireless dropper post. The new 170 mm Fox 38 Factory front fork with a Grip2 damper. It has the Fox DPX2 Factory Float shock at the rear, carbon wheels from NEWMEN and the new Schwalbe Supertrail \ntyres in 2.4 in \u2013 Magic Mary up front and Big Betty at the back. All new this year: internal gear cable and brake hose routing. This model comes in a Nyon and Kiox version. The Reaction Hybrid range covers everything from commuting to sporty mountain bike tours. It's a great way to discover e-mountain biking. All models now come with Intube and X-Core technology and are hugely practical. Just add a kickstand, luggage rack and mudguards using the mounting points provided. The Reaction SLT is our range-topping model. We gave it a 148 mm Boost rear end for maximum stiffness. Along with an 85 Nm Bosch CX drive, the brand-new, \ncrystal-clear Nyon display and Shimano XT 1x12 gears. Shimano XT 4-piston brakes deliver powerful braking front and rear. Up front we have a 120 mm Fox 34 Rhythm fork. The men's version boasts an incredible system weight of 150 kg. The Nurides are our e-mountain bikes with Easy-Entry \nframes and maximum safety both uphill and down. I specifically say e-mountain bikes because our step-through \nframes have undergone the same strict in-house safety tests as our hard tail frames and passed with flying colours. The powerful Bosch drive units deliver maximum assistance on the climbs. We have wide tyres, a 100 mm front suspension fork and a stable construction for added safety. The Allroad models are equipped to handle all weather conditions. The Nuride SL comes with a FOX 34 Rhythm front fork. It's super soft and gives a planted ride. We also have the precise-shifting Shimano XT 12x transmission. There's a 4-piston XT brake up front and a \nsuspension seatpost to help smooth out bumps at the rear. A Nyon display and Bosch CX drive unit with 625 Wh and 85 Nm complete the package. As on all of our touring bikes, we developed a new handlebar with 15\u00b0 of backsweep. It substantially improves comfort by changing \nthe position of my hands from here to here. The Kathmandu is our touring bike range with \nthe powerful 85 Nm Bosch CX drive and integrated power unit. The Kathmandu is our touring bike range with \nthe powerful 85 Nm Bosch CX drive and integrated power unit. All models in this range have an integrated luggage \nrack for really stable handling when carrying heavy loads. All models in this range have an integrated luggage \nrack for really stable handling when carrying heavy loads. The efficient, comfort-oriented geometry keeps long cycle tours relaxing and enjoyable. The efficient, comfort-oriented geometry keeps long cycle tours relaxing and enjoyable. All models feature an adjustable stem to find the \nperfect riding position and a 100 mm front suspension fork. The range-topping Kathmandu SLT comes with the brand-new Bosch Nyon display, 12x Shimano XT transmission and 4-piston XT brakes front and rear. At the front is a 100 mm RockShox Recon Gold. Last but not least we fitted a parallelogram seatpost from by.Schulz. The Touring is our most popular touring e-bike with the \n3rd-generation Bosch drive and now with Powertube and X-Core technology. It's incredibly quiet, unobtrusive and reliable. The 3rd-generation Bosch drive effortlessly assists speeds up to 25 kph. The Touring has 100 mm of front suspension travel, \na suspension seatpost and adjustable stem for maximum comfort. Our highlight is the Touring Pro with 1x10 Shimano Deore gears and Shimano MT200 brakes It comes with a 100 mm Suntour front fork and a crystal-clear Bosch Intuvia display. These are our Rookie e-mountain bikes for young riders. They're great for evening loops with mum and dad or long adventure rides on family holidays. The pedal-assist makes it super fun for kids. Rookie bikes are limited to 20 kph for safety. We fitted new handlebars with narrower-diameter grips to stop small hands from tiring quickly. The grips are much more ergonomic and energy saving.

My name is Joe. I'm from Mattress Clarity. Today, I'm going to be taking a look at the\nEmma Mattress. I'm going to be running through everything\nyou need to know about this mattress, the pros, the cons, construction details, who\nit is a good fit for, who it's not a good fit for. Basically, by the end of the video you're\ngoing to have a pretty good idea if you to want to get it. So, stay tuned. [music] Joe: All right, first things first. If you have any questions about today's review\nwhatsoever, or I can even give you a personal recommendation if you just leave a comment\nbelow. I do read and reply back to every single comment\non YouTube so I will give you a response, just leave a comment below. I will get back to you as soon as I can. We have the Emma Mattress here. It's very successful in Europe, and they are\nbringing that over to the United States. It reminds me a lot of the other bed-in-the-box\nmattresses so I decided to jump in and review this, and see how it compared to those other\nmattresses I've reviewed before. Let's talk about the construction of the Emma\nMattress starting with the cover here, nice soft cover, has a nice texture to it. It's pretty thin so it's not really going\nto affect the overall feel of the mattress too much. Moving onto the mattress now. We have three layers. We have a top Airgocell foam layer which is\nlatex-like. It's pretty springy, you can see it's pretty\nsoft as well. Can push my hand down pretty easily there. It's also very breathable film overall. Then we have memory foam underneath that. You'll see it's that classic slow-moving memory\nfoam feel. What's interesting here is that you'll see\nthese channels right here. Underneath the shoulders of these channels,\nin the middle part of the mattress there aren't these channels. There's going to be more give in this part\nof the mattress. Underneath your shoulders if you're on your\nside it's going to give in a little bit more, give you a little more pressure relief. We call that zoned construction. You get more support when you're on your back,\nbut a little more pressure relief when you're on your shoulders. This has very nice, unique construction to\nthis mattress. It's going to be a very breathable mattress\noverall. You can see how much room there is for air\nto flow through there. This top layer right here is pretty breathable\noverall, and it combines latex-like and then memory foam like qualities. You can have the springy-ness, not the feeling\nof getting stuck, but then also the pressure relief of memory foam. Very nice construction overall. Let's talk about firmness and feel now. As far as firmness is concerned it does have\na little bit of unique construction. It feels a little bit softer when you're on\nyour side versus when you're on your back or stomach. I would put it overall about a 6 out of 10,\njust a little bit softer than average. You have some pretty soft top layers on top\nhere. You can push your hand in relatively easily,\nand it gets progressively firmer underneath that so about a 6 out of 10. As far as the feel is concerned, it combines\nmemory foam and latex-like qualities so there's going to be some bounce to this mattress which\nyou'll see here. Bounces right up there. Underneath that there is memory foam, so you're\nnot going to get the feeling of getting stuck. Overall, it's a balanced feel, I would say. Now I'm going to talk to you about how I feel\nabout different sleeping positions. Starting on my back, first thing I notice\nis that my hips sink in, but not too much. Pretty supportive feel overall, so a good\nmatch for me there. Switching on to my side you have this zoned\nconstruction so it's a little bit softer when you're on your side. It's actually a very good match for me here. I don't really feel any pressure whatsoever\non my shoulders and hips. It's a good match for me on my side. Switching on to my stomach, I would say it's\na little bit too soft for me. If you sleep on your stomach really any way,\nI'd probably look elsewhere. You'd probably want something a little bit\nfirmer than this mattress. At Mattress Clarity we love our pressure map\ntest. It's a very objective test that shows you\nexactly how well every mattress relieves pressure. I'm going to get down on this pressure map\nhere, lie down on my back, side and stomach. You're going to see anywhere from blue to\nno pressure all the way up to red to high pressure. The only thing to note is that if you have\na different body type than I do, you may see different results. Let's get started. [music] Martin: Hey guys, Martin here to offer a different\nperspective. Joe's 5'9, 160, but I'm 6'7, 230. I'm a larger person than Joe. I want to talk about my experience with the\nEmma Mattress. In terms of firmness, Joe said this was a\n6 out of 10. I thought it was closer to a 6.5 or 7 out\nof 10. That's because I'm a larger person, I'm pressing\nfurther into the mattress, feeling some more firmness than Joe did. In terms of sleeping positions starting on\nmy back, a very, very nice match for me, overall support. I feel less support on my lumbar area as well,\nso very good for back sleeping. Moving to my side, I would usually worry about\nfeeling some firmness on my shoulders and my hips, but there is some zoning on this\nmattress. It's actually softer under my shoulders and\nmy hips. A nice match for side sleeping. Moving to my stomach, the mattress is definitely\ntoo soft for me. I'm a larger person so I'm bowing at the hips\nsomewhat, getting out of alignment. What does all that mean? If you're a heavier back or side sleeper,\nthis could be a very good match for you. If you're a heavier stomach sleeper, I would\nlook elsewhere. Joe: If you sleep with a partner you're going\nto want to consider motion transfer. Basically, if your partner is moving around\non that side of the bed, is that motion going to be isolated or transfer over to you and\npossibly wake you up at night? To test that I have a glass here. I'm going to create a little disturbance around\nthe glass. We'll see how this glass reacts. See that it's moving a little bit, but it\nis isolating motion pretty well. I also had Martin on my team jumping in and\nout of bed, create a little bit of disturbance. I didn't really feel motion transfer over\nto me. I would say that this mattress is a pretty\ngood option for couples. If you sleep with a partner or you like sleeping\ntowards the edge of the bed. You're going to want to consider edge support. Can you sit or sleep towards the edge of the\nwithout feeling like you're going to fall off? I'm on the edge here. You can see that the foam is collapsing quite\na bit. Not necessarily the best. I'm going to get down on my back now. I'm getting that rolling of the bed feeling\na little bit. I would say in this case the edge support\nis fairly average. Let's talk through some of the pros of this\nmattress. If you're looking for a medium firm mattress,\nor something a little bit softer than medium, you're definitely going to like this mattress\noverall. If you're a side sleeper, this does a great\njob at relieving pressure so I think you're going to find this to be a very good match. If you're a light or medium weight back sleeper\nas well, I think you're going to find this to be a good match as well. This has memory foam in it, but it's very\nbreathable. If you're worried about sleeping hot, this\ncan be a good option for you as well. We know about the pros but now let's talk\nabout the cons of this mattress, or who I think this mattress might not be the best\nfit for. If you're looking for something a little bit\nfirmer than average, or something very firm, I would definitely look elsewhere. This is definitely a little bit softer than\naverage. If you are just a stomach sleeper, you're\nprobably going to want something a little bit firmer, a little bit more supportive overall,\nas well. If you're a heavier sleeping you're probably\ngoing to want something a little more supportive, perhaps with something with coils in the support\nlayer. If you take a look at the Emma Mattress, you've\nprobably known there's a lot more bed-in-the-box options out there that are pretty similarly\nconstructed. Why should you get the Emma over those mattresses? Well, I think it's a very, very good value. It has a nice zoned construction. To have it be a queen under a thousand dollars\nis very good value. That really stands out to me. If you're a side sleeper it's softer than\naverage. It gives in because the zoned construction\nreally relieves that pressure very well. If you're a strict side sleeper, you're definitely\ngoing to want to take a look at this mattress as well. Also, because of the zoned construction if\nyou're a combination sleeper, it's going to be more supportive when you're on your back\nand stomach and a little bit more pressure relieving if you're on your side. If you're a combination sleeper, I would definitely\ntake a look at this mattress as well. It also has memory foam in it, yet it's still\nvery breathable so if you're worried about sleeping hot I'd definitely take a look at\nthis mattress too. I want to provide you with some additional\ninformation if you're interested in buying the Emma Mattress. You're going to have free shipping and returns,\na 10-year warranty and 100 nights to try this out. You're also going to have financing available. If you're worried about making one big lump\nsum payment, you can make smaller monthly payments, which is really nice. They also have a couple of accessories available\ntoo. To wrap up, I think a lot of people are going\nto like this mattress. If you're a side sleeper you're really going\nto love this mattress, or if you're a light medium-weight back sleeper. I'm just cautioning you if you want something\na little bit firmer than average or you're just a strict stomach sleeper, I would maybe\nlook elsewhere. But I think a lot of people are going to like\nthis mattress. That's basically it. If you're just getting started with your mattress\nbuying journey, definitely check out mattressclarity.com.

Once again, let me know if you have any questions.", "MspPBSFct5M": "You've just received your poly \ngel - hybrid gel from Amazon. You've opened it up. Now you're faced with\nforms or dual forms/poppits. I'm going to show you which one \nto choose and why - the benefits of both. Let's get started. I'm Suzie and I want to show \nyou how you can work this DIY kit to your advantage. I'm gonna show what we \nhave in here. We have... there is a topcoat A base coat,\nthere's a slip. Now. This is a poly gel they've \nactually called it on the box here. But technically it's \na Hybrid Gel. That's what they're called. Here are some gems and a little \napplicator I don't know if I use that but we'll see there's \nthe forms in the dual form, some instructions and some \ncolors file and the fresh let's just get it all out. They give you \neverything you need. That's are noisy so first we're going to \nprep the nails. I have taken everything \noff my nails. I've prepped most of them. So they've given you a nice \nlittle file and they've got the 180 and 100 grit. If you have any acrylic or gel \non your nails you can use the 100 the lower the number the \ngrittier the stronger it is but the 180 if you have natural \nnails that would be the good one to use and that'll be the \nsofter grit so you can just feel it with your fingers. You can feel the grittier \nthat's the hundred. And this one softer. That's the 180. So I'm going to use the 180 and just buff\nup the natural nail just so you know this\nis not a sponsored video. They did send it to me\nbut I know you can buy it off Amazon.com. OK. So I've buffed them both up. I do have\na little duster here. I'm just going to \ndust that away. Now let me see we're going to \ndo forms and dual forms. I wanted to show\nyou the difference between dual forms and forms. They are very different. They both have their advantages \nof which one you want to use. Forms we know how to work that \nis and we don't have to prep but dual forms you do have to \ndo a bit of a prep in that is you have to decide what size \nyou're going to use. So you want to do that before \nyou put any base coat prepping the nail for the application. And if you're doing\nthis on yourself you can keep these poppits. Now I'm just going to find the \none I'm going to do. Let's say we do the poppit on \nthis finger I shall do it on a wider finger and then we'll do \nthe form on this finger so I've got to find\none that fits this. Now I push my cuticles back but \nI do my nails all the time so they're constantly being pushed \nback anyway so I didn't have to do it right \nspecifically for now. But you can see when you fit in \nthere so it's a little bit wider than mine actually. But it does fit. And I can put\nit in there quite comfortably. But if you turn it to the side \nyou want to make sure that the plastic part comes all \nthe way down. Not shy of it like this Not even like this but right \ndown as if the nail, thenatural nail was being pulled \nright out. You want to make sure that the \nplastic is going to come out that far. So you want to make sure the \nside is taking care of and always check the opposite side \nit's hard to see on that side but make sure that that \nside is too. So what might look too small... See this one. This is a good example. So if I put this is one size \nsmaller so if I put this down like this see how it's gaping \non the one side. See that right there. It's not capturing the side. So this would not be good. You'd have a little \ngaping hole. So this one is going\nto be a very good fit. So let's do that one. I like that one let's pick out our \nlittle form. I love doing forms but forms \nrequires much more skill. All of this requires skill. There's just certain \nlevels of skill. Now I'm an acrylic artist. I've been acrylic artist for \nover 30 years so my favorite is sculpting acrylic and gel this \ntype of nail is helping us save some of those steps if you \ndon't know how to do that. This makes those things a \nlittle bit easier. I've got my form ready to go \nand we just place the form on the finger. I'm going to pinch that\ngive a nice narrow Look OK So here's the base coat we're going to put the \nbase coat on. We'll put it on this nail OK. So I put the base coat on Then I'm gonna get the brush. Now you can't really use a \nacrylic brush or a gel brush in place of a hybrid gel brush. Reason being is there usually a \nbit stronger of bristles C and you need that strength. You can do it with those \nbrushes but it is a little easier with these ones because \nit's a little bit stronger and you need that to\npush the poly gel around. So we'll see if this Hybrid Gel \nis looser or a little bit stronger and you might \nneed more push. So let's check that out. Oh color. We get to decide color. OK now we have a\nfew colors to choose from. I don't want the dark red one I \ntend to lean toward the soft. I don't think I'm\ngoing to go totally nude. This one's awfully pretty. So let's just take a look. Now hybrid gels, poly gels \nusually come in these. Well they always come in a \ndarker tube so you can't see through it because we don't \nwhat the natural sunlight to get at it because the UV is \nwhat cures it and that's what we don't want until we \nare totally ready. This is very pretty. That's a really \nreally beautiful color. OK. So here's the fun part. I've got the slick dish. Now they do provide\na slip and this is usually basically alcohol. I don't know if this is exactly \nbut I'm going to pretty much assume that it is. And so I'm just going to pour \nsome of this slip inside here Fill the puppet with as much \nhybrid gel as you think you might need Get my brush so the idea is you want to \nestablish the length that you're going for. I'm gonna get them kind of long You know that finished sculpted \nnail that you go for when you're going for the \ntraditional way which is on top of a form. You are trying to build that \ninside this dual tip. So by the time you put it on \nyour finger it reveals a whole nail that you've built inside \nthe tip and you're going to press it against \nyour natural nail. What it's doing is actually \neliminating all the after sculpting so you have to really \nmake sure that you're building the nail inside by getting in \nthe product all the way to the side. That's looking pretty good. So I'm just going to pull some \naway from the cuticle a little bit OK. So now I'm ready to put the \ndual form on but now I've got the wet base\ncoat remember that? They kind of missed\nthat on the directions here. Most base coats, well base \ncoats you cure especially for it's Gel. So I am going to cure it for 60 \nseconds and I pick 60 seconds because when you cure the whole \nthing it says 30 to 60 seconds at the end of it. So it could be\n30 it could be 60. They don't actually say that. I think they just accidentally \nmissed telling you to cure that part. So I'm just gonna give it a \ngood cure before we put the poly gel on there OK. So now we want to put our \npoppit on there so we wanna place it at the cuticle. We just want to gently press it \nin but don't press it and so far that you press\nall the poly gel out. The reason being is because you \nwant it to be that built nail between if you squish it too \nhard you'll squish it all out and then you're going to lose \nyour nail that you just sculpted inside there. I'm just gonna press it \ngently on there. And it's adhering. I'm gonna check on my\nsides and looking pretty good. Now if you have\nan extra amount from underneath which you might. Maybelay ot on the table and \nthen just pull a little bit I don't have too much it's \nlooking pretty good. But you can just pull \nthe extra out. Just be careful not to press \nyour nail into the table too much because if you do you're \ngoing to squish that sculpted nail that you just created. You're going to squish it too \nmuch and you're not going to have much in there. So that's looking pretty good. Now I've got a little bit \nof Poly Gel, I'm going to show you this. See a little bit of poly gel \nthat squished out the cuticle? Just take your alcohol - your \nslip and wipe that away for two reasons you don't want \nit on there and secondly you do not want to cure that big lump \nof product there because then you're gonna have to \nfile it right. You might have to anyway. So I'm just going to make sure \nthat it's pressed in there Now It'll be sticking up \nbecause you have the form holding your sculpted nail so \nthere's going to be a lift on it. Same with this form when we're \nfinished building we take it right out and same \nwith the poppit, we're gonna take it right out. OK. So I'm going to nuke it and it \nsays cure for 60 seconds so I'm going to cure in\nthis lamp for 60 seconds. Then we get to remove \nthe dual mold. Okay. Now we get to pop it off and I \nbelieve you just give it a little bit of a wiggle. I sort of press it together too \n- it sort of just pops it right off a little bit. If you're having trouble \npopping it off, it may be that you didn't nuke it \nlong enough. You want to make sure that it \nis cured for the right amount of time and then you can just \ngive it a bit of a wiggle and you can even sort of get an \nedge and sort of lift it they're hard to get off Oh there it goes. Okay So you can see that lip. That's the real big \ndisadvantage with these things if you do have\nthat bit of a lip. But we can file that. OK. So here's the file. Now you can take the\none 180 or the 100. Doesn't matter now because you \nare filing on an actual cured nail Now the whole idea for this is \nyou don't have to sculpt it. Sculpting is an art. It takes quite a lot\nto learn how to sculpt a nail perfectly. Make them a little bit shorter \nI think Oh I think I'm going to do the shape that I like so I'm just gonna sculpt this \nup with this thing and try to do my sides. I'm going to not touch the \nsurface as much to show you how much the surface is a huge \nadvantage of being so smooth like that. Right? I'm just gonna give\nthat a nice little shake. Now the cuticle is still quite \nraised and I don't really like that. Now,It will do that\nfor a couple of reasons. The form itself - these forms \nare trying to shape it as best you can like one pair \nof shoes that, one size fits all. Well you know how hard that \nwould be for all different sizes and shapes. Right? So when you put the form on \nit's a it's a version of this rocking it. So it's it's down enough, \nif your fingernail curves down a little bit or if it's curving \nup a little bit you kind of don't want to rock it to hard \nbecause the back end might come up and my nails tend to\ncurve a little bit that way. So naturally the cuticle is \ngonna want to pop up like that otherwise I have it that it's \ngonna be super thick underneath right to try to make\nup the compensation for it. So they're not going to fit \nperfectly and then you just want to compensate when you're \ntrying to file them and shape them to fit yourself\nas more of a custom. So. OK. So we can shape this one a \nlittle bit later let's start working on getting the hybrid \ngel on the formed nail and then we can compare \nthe differences. Let me just paint\nthe base coat on here whenever you're working with a \nhybrid gel or a soak off gel or a gel in general anything you \nwant to use a base coat it's better for adhesion and \nit's better for the nail because a lot of products are \nnot meant to go directly to the nail plate you need to\nhave the base coat in between. So I'm just gonna\ngive that the nuke time and now I'm going to do all the \nsculpting with the brush as opposed with the dual form \nbecause that basically did the sculpting for us on top. I'm going to place this on here \nand then I'm going to work with my slip which \nis basically alcohol. So if you get the kit and you \nrun out of the slip you can just use rubbing alcohol and there's no time factor. You could just play around with \nthis as long as you want. I'm just now shaping this into \nthe nail that I want And you want to bring\nit right down to the side. This gives you more of a custom \nfeel if you're going to do it this way but it requires more \npatience more skill more time you might say. And it may not be something \nthat you're interested in. And if it is you'll know the \ndifference between the paper form and the dual form. Now what's interesting about\nthis, this is nice and smooth on this side \nexcept for the cuticle we're gonna clean that up. But this is nice and smooth but \nthis is not going to be that's where the sculpting comes in. But that's where this\nyou can avoid the sculpting. When you flip it over and I \ntake the form off it's gonna be this \nsmoothness underneath there. That's probably how someone got \nthe idea was to create that smoothness and then just flip \nit over it. It's really very smart OK. So when I'm happy with the \nsculpting I can just give it a nuke and then I can keep adding \nand sculpting to it and shaping it up the way I want so here. I just want increased\nmy arch a little bit. And I want to work\non the shape a little bit. So I'm just going to add some \nright in that arch area OK. So once I get them all sculpted \nthe way I want with the hybrid gel, \nthat's a great thing. It's just you can take as long \nas you want to do that once you're ready just give it a \ngood nuke and then we're going to shape. So now we've got our dual form \nand our sculpted form. So when you pull\noff the sculpted form Means the paper form that I \nsculpted the nail with. If you flip it up underneath \nyou can see this one is quite smooth. That's because it was against \nthe paper and like the same effect that the opposite side \nis for the dual form on the top it leaves it nice and smooth. So you don't have\nto do all the sculpting. Just trying to eliminate the \nsculpting for you which is really great. Now you may have to mold the \ncuticle depending on the shape of your natural nail and where \nthe form is rocking. You may have a little extra \nunder here or you may have a little more at the cuticle \ndepending on how your nail shaped. So we can get rid of that \nthough it's not a big deal. We can just\ntake your little file and I'm gonna just file at the \ncuticle area to make it nice and smooth. I'm not touching the rest of \nthe nails so much because I kind of want to\nkeep that nice smooth finish. And when we put the\ntop coat that'll take care of this area here. And then I'm gonna shape the \nnail in general and I go for that nice Suzie Almond Shape \nthat I like so much I'm being very careful not to \ntouch the surface of that. So I don't have to \nsculpt so much. Now if you want to you can. I'm just trying to avoid it \nbecause that's what the whole idea of the dual form is. OK I'm just sort of blending \nthat cuticle in. I will use the 180side of this \nfile so it's a bit smoother OK. Now I'll use the same file and \nI will sculpt and start to shape the one that I sculpted. Now like I say\nit's all smooth under there. So we are purely\nworking on the top part. OK. So I filed them all out now on \nthe dual form one I just wanted to straighten out the cuticle \nsmooth it in so it just has a nice smooth blend because when \nit goes out you do want a thick edge. And I left the part that I \ndidn't have to sculpt at all just to show you the advantage \nof the dual form is that you have to do \nvery little sculpting, right? And this finger which was the \npaper form I sculpted completely and I had just you \nknow shape over top of the whole thing but now we're ready \nto put the top coat on. But before I do that I have to \nbuff up the surface of the shiny one because the top coat \nneeds to soak into a buffed surface so I'm not changing\nthe shape at this point. I am simply just \nbuffing the surface. So the top coat can adhere. Now I'm gonna does both of them OK. So now I'm going to\nput a nice top coat on. It's a beautiful color. I really do like the color OK. And that says on their \ninstructions a 30 to 60 second cure time. So I'm going to\ncure for 60 seconds OK. I think before the revealsI \nwill finish the rest of them. So we'll have the whole hand to \nlook at for the reveal shots so check those out so I don't know if you noticed \nbut three of those are the poppit forms the dual forms and \ntwo of them I sculpted on. See this finger You can see the poppit shape is \nrather square at the cuticle area but check my index finger \nwhere I sculpted it. I maintain the shape\nof my natural cuticle which ultimately makes the whole nail \nlook more natural. That's the \nadvantage of sculpting. You can custom fit\nit to your natural nail. On the pinky I filed the \ncuticle area of my poppit to match my finger, \nWith experience sculpting does look more natural. But if you don't have those \nskills you can certainly leave the shape of the poppit If you're not used \nto sculpting. I'd start with the dual forms \nand sculpt it that way. And then when you get used to \nthat then if you want try the paper forms and then sculpt \nit that way. But ultimately it's really just \nhow you sculpt it all out in the end. They look \nabsolutely beautiful. I'm actually looking forward to \ntrying the other colors.

So originally I went with these Logitech keyboards\nand mice that have built in profiles to switch from one device to another, but I find the\nlatency with a Bluetooth mouse too sluggish for my liking, and actually prefer the comfort\nand responsiveness of my older non-bluetooth G602 mouse instead. Also I didn\u2019t want to be limited if I switched\nback to a wired keyboard or mouse. So instead, I picked up this USB 3.0 switch. It has 4 connections on the front for accessories\nlike my mouse and keyboard. And cables in the back to connect to my desktop\nand one to my laptop. Now with a single press these USB devices\nare routed to either the desktop or laptop, and switches instantly back with another click. Much simpler than needing to replug my devices\nevery time. Next up is using the display with both the\ndesktop and laptop. And most monitors and display will have multiple\nconnections so switching the display between systems is usually straight forward. Unfortunately the 4K TV I\u2019m using here only\nsupports HDMI 2.0 for that full 4K 60Hz, something that this Dell XPS 15 is lacking. So I went with a USB-C to HDMI 2.0 adapter\nto solve this problem. It\u2019s a pretty straight forward solution,\nto get that full 4K 60Hz experience from my laptop to the TV. The adapter also supports power delivery that\nis driven with a separate usb charger. But you\u2019ll need to keep in mind, this setup\nonly supports up to 60W of power delivery back to the notebook. This is much lower than the 130W of power\nthe original power brick supports, so if fully loaded on the CPU and GPU, the battery may\nnot charge or even drain a little while plugged in this way but during my typical usage it\nmore than enough for a slow recharge when docked. And finally a laptop stand. While this isn\u2019t completely necessary. You know I\u2019m a huge fan of reducing clutter\non the desk with stuff like my monitor stands. And I feel the same way about a laptop stand. Floating the laptop saves space on the desk,\nand allows you to position the laptop closer or out of the way as necessary throughout\nthe day. I\u2019m using the Amazon Basic monitor arm here\ncombined with their laptop mount to hold this together. This robust design feel very solid and secure\nwith my laptop. And the pneumatic arm make it really easy\nto reposition closer or out of the way depending on what I\u2019m doing. So that\u2019s how I combine my laptop and desktop\ninto a single workstation. And not feel like my workstation is compromised\nin any way whether I choose one or the other. But that\u2019s just how I prefer to run my computer\nsetup at home. Hope you guys enjoyed this one. You know what to do. And I\u2019ll see you in the next video.", "dti2r1KbkDQ": "- Hey, everyone. Today we're gonna talk a look\nat the Beautyrest Hybrid. Now, you know Beautyrest has\nbeen around for generations. In fact, the company\noriginally started in 1870, one of the oldest mattress\ncompanies in America. So, they definitely have a\nlot of industry know-how. And, we're gonna see how it compares to some of the newer\nplayers in the market. So, let's take a look. (upbeat music) Now, you can buy the Beautyrest mattress directly from the Beautyrest website. And, what'll happen is, after you place your order you do get free White Glove deliveries. So, you'll get a call later, or an email, to schedule that delivery window, and, the mattress will be brought into the room of your choice, it'll be laid out on the bed, and, all the packaging will be taken away. And, quite honestly, I was kinda surprised not to be able to unbox\nthis mattress because, now I'm just so used to\nthese things coming in boxes. It was kind of a nice surprise to be able to have somebody come in and just know that they\ncould set this up for me. The other advantage to this is, there's very little off-gassing because this mattress has had time to breath through that delivery process, so you can sleep on it\nright away when you get it. There's no needing to wait. The Beautyrest Hybrid is a\nvery substantial mattress. It measures 13 and a half inches thick, much thicker than your\ntypical online 10 inch brands. So, it has a substantial look and feel. It accommodates sheets, makes them nice and tight across your bed. The top layer is made with\na phase change fabric. This means it's cool to the touch. Again, some companies will skimp on this. They'll say they have\nphase change material, but, it doesn't really last that long. When I sat on this mattress I could feel that cooling\ntechnology through my jeans and it lasted quite a while. Now, quilted into this\ncover you'll find a layer of the Beautyrest gel foam. So, this foam, again,\nhas cooling properties, you're continuing that cooling story. Underneath that, you get two more inches of that Beautyrest gel foam, followed by another layer of\nmedium firm comfort fit foam. That's just a nice transition\nlayer for the base layer, which is a pocket coil system. And, as I've said many times, pocket coils are sort of underrated. People think that's kind of old guard, but really, pocket coils are excellent for pressure relief and contouring. So, they're just adding the\nbest of both worlds right there. Finally, you have a nice\nedge support system. It's a piece of foam, a\nvery firm piece of foam, that runs along the\nperimeter of the mattress and allows you to sleep\nright up to the edge. So, you can really maximize\nuse of that mattress. Now, in terms of feel, this mattress is labeled as a medium firm on the Beautyrest website. I found it skewed quite a bit firmer. I would say, medium firm to firm. If you're looking for something softer, you know, definitely go with\none of their plush models, if you're looking for something\nmore along the medium line. The reason I say that is that the coil system is really what\ngives it that firmer feel. They're using a firm coil\nsystem on top of foam layers. So, when I first sat\ndown and laid down on it, you're immediately going to\nfeel that cooling technology, that phase change material. So, if you're a hot sleeper, I don't think you're gonna have any issues with sleeping too hot. You know, that phase change\nreally does the trick and you've got all those\ncooling layers beneath that. But, that coil system, you're\ngonna hit that coil system and you're gonna get\nthat really good support. So, if you're a stomach and back sleeper, you're not gonna notice too\nmuch contouring along your back, you're not gonna wake up with a sore back If you're a side sleeper, you may hit that coil\nsystem a little too soon, and, it may leave you\nwanting more contouring than what this one can provide. So, I'd probably look at some\nmore of their plush options. Now, in terms of motion transfer, like I said, it's really hard to get these coil systems to engage. Now, I was plopping around on this thing, really trying to get this thing to bounce, and, yes, you're gonna\nget some bounce on it, but, it's not gonna\nhave too much play there because they are using,\nagain, that firm coil system. So, all in all, if you want a mattress with very little motion transfer, skewing a bit on the\nfirmer end of the spectrum, and you are a stomach or back sleeper, I think this is a great choice. The Beautyrest Hybrid retails for $1,300, but, be sure to head\nover to sleepsherpa.com and we'll have the latest discounts. This mattress comes with 100 night trial. What that means is, it's a\nfree White Glove delivery, where they're gonna come in, set it up, you can try it for a\nlittle over three months. If you don't like it, they'll come in and haul\nit away for free, as well. If you wanna keep it,\nit's a 10 year trial. That means they're gonna take care of you for those 10 years and their warrant against any defects, any faults with the mattress, whatsoever. Beautyrest has been around for\nover 100 years, like I said. They know what they're\ndoing, and, there's no doubt, this company is gonna be\naround for a lot longer. They're really gonna take care of you. So, in conclusion, I'm\nreally excited about the Beautyrest Hybrid. It's great for you stomach\nand back sleepers out there. Side sleepers, it's probably\ngonna skew a little too firm, may wanna catch out some of\ntheir more plush offerings. And, to be frank, I'm just really excited to see Beautyrest come back\ninto the online marketplace here and they really do hold their own against some of the new online players. Beautyrest, they really\nheld no punches with this, 13 and a half inches deep. You can maximize this mattress,\nsleep right up to the edge, great edge support. Just a really solid offering\nat a really, really good price.

is kind of a curve that goes around and around like that our third clue we have all three clues that means we're ready for our thank you chair great let's go", "h5li2AECobY": "hey everyone I'm Jeff Rahzel from the slumber yard today we're doing a video about the dream cloud mattress so we've done a full review plenty of other comparisons and by our guides I'll link those in the description but for anybody that's short on time I want to do a video about the major things that you need to know with this mattress so the three best and also the three worst things about it so if you enjoy the video make sure to give us a thumbs up consider subscribing to our Channel and you can leave any questions or comments down below in the comment section let's get to it [Music] all right so like I said before down below in the description our full review other pieces of content and probably some coupon code so check that out let's get right into it with the three best features of dream cloud the first has to be the warranty and the trial period these are pretty unique so number one it has what they're calling a never long warranty essentially it is a lifetime warranty that's normal that comment usually we see beds with about a 10 year warranty so this one basically a lifetime warranty it is tiered you can read more about that on dream clouds website I'll link that in the description but it has an ever long warranty which is pretty cool and it has a 365 night trial so most beds they come with a hundred night trial so you can test them out in your house this one you can still test it out in the comfort of your own home without somebody like lording over you telling you what to do but you have an entire year to make up your mind that is more than enough time that's more than enough time to allow your body to adjust to the bed more than enough time to allow the bed to soften up so you can get a true picture of what this mattress is gonna be like long-term what its gonna be like six seven years out and I think that's awesome like I said before we typically see a hundred nights 365 nights is way above and beyond now the second best feature of dream cloud is just the construction so this is a thick durable burly mattress so if you're like 200 225 250 300 pounds this mattress will be suitable for you so usually with bed in a box mattresses they're like 10 inches made entirely of foam and really they don't cater to larger individuals there are a few I'll link some other ones there I'll link our full lists down below in the description but dream cloud is one of them it's a thick durable burly mattress and it could handle petite medium like me and heavier individuals it has coils and has multiple layers of memory foam and latex foam and the last thing one of my favorite things about this bed is just the cooling properties so it doesn't have anything that actively cools you down at night but because it is a firmer mattress we kind of put it in that medium firm maybe a little bit firmer range it's a firmer mattress you're gonna sleep more on top of it rather than sinking in it and that means less in the materia we'll be hugging your body and that just means you're gonna sleep cooler at night so whenever you get a softer mattress if it doesn't have any cooling properties you're probably gonna warm up a little bit with dream cloud it's on the firmer end you will indeed sleep cooler Dylan on our team he's our resident Big Dawg oh he sleeps on dream cloud and it's a really cool nice mattress for him so I like the cooling properties nothing that actively cools you down but it sleeps on the cooler end of things now in terms of what I don't like about this mattress the first thing is because it is thick burly durable it does cost more than your standard bed in a box mattress in fact we did a list of our top 10 favorite bed in a box mattresses usually the more affordable ones I'll link that in the description I don't think we had dream cloud on that list simply because is a little bit more expensive and they're one of the companies that kind of plays games with pricing which I really don't like I don't like it when people are a little more coy with pricing so what they do is they set MSRP high and they almost always offer a discount so I'll leave a link to the link on in the description so you can check the pricing of it it's usually about $1,200 for a queen-size mattress the second thing is side sleepers need not apply unless you're like 300 pounds you probably should not be sleeping on her side on dream cloud it's just too firm you're gonna wake up with a little bit of upper back pain maybe some shoulder pain maybe even hip pain so if you're a strict side sleeper check down below in the description there are some much better peds out there for side sleepers don't get this bad if you sleep exclusively or mostly on your side this is a back and stomach sleeper and also a combination sleeper bed and last up is motion isolation despite the fact that it has micro coils and a memory foam you'd think it'd be really really good at motion isolation it's just like average too good it's not the best we've seen but it's not terrible it's just nothing to write home about it's firmer it doesn't really tend to isolate motion as well as a lot of other beds out there so if you or your partner is particularly active in your sleep and you're worried about waking up the other person I wouldn't put dream cloud in my short list like I said it's not terrible but it's also not the best out there I don't think it's a highlight point for the mattress guess that's what I'm trying to say and that's it those are the three best and the three worst things about dream cloud I really like to know what you think of course like I said before we did our full review it's in the description have a great day [Music]", "Vpwy7j2zbQ4": "After the Lockwood fiasco, the dinos are free, Roaming the States on an eating spree. Trying to munch people at camping grounds, Scaring folks to death in cities and towns. As if things weren\u2019t bad enough, A deadly virus hit the world, now THAT is rough. You can\u2019t teach dinosaurs social distance rules, We\u2019ll have to catch & quarantine them with tranquilizer tools. Based on our tests there\u2019s something interesting I\u2019ve seen, Dinosaurs are immune to Covid-19. In Dino DNA lies the key to a vaccine, Then mix the two to start a new hybrid scheme. Though Indominus and Indoraptor miserably failed, I think a Dino-virus mixture would surely prevail. The way to earn more profits when selling a vaccine, Is setting free a beast that\u2019s contagious and mean. Here we go again, They take my DNA. To make a monster, So mean and stronger. Half dino, half virus, Bred to wipe out any populace. Stomp victims with my feet, Or introduce them to my teeth. Thin out the herd with Covid, Eat all asymptomatic. I am a menace, Half dino, half virus. Co-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex. Co-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex. Blue and Rexy must be freed, And don\u2019t forget steal Dr Wu\u2019s vaccine. Mass-produce enough to heal mankind, So we can finally leave this disaster behind. Uh, but as long as that hybrid\u2019s free, The virus won\u2019t cease its deadly spree. Mutations can\u2019t be stopped by a single injection, We need help to stop that beast from spreading infections. Staying still won\u2019t save you from being lunch, But running can\u2019t save you from its viral punch. Masks don\u2019t provide a sure-fire protection, Only hazmat suits can prevent Covid infections. Now that we\u2019re sure that we can\u2019t get sick and die, Our dinosaur friends belt out their battle cries. They\u2019re immune to the illness, our best shot, To halt Coronasaurus-Rex, make sure the chaos stops. This better be the last time, Fighting hybrids, I\u2019m drawing the line. Next time you monkeys screw up, I\u2019ll pack my bags, leave you all to die. Half dino, half virus, Bred to wipe out any populace. Stomp victims with my feet, Or introduce them to my teeth. Thin out the herd with Covid, Eat all asymptomatic. I am a menace, Half dino, half virus. All this hybrid fighting\u2019s too much for me, You\u2019d better pay for my holiday. First class, all expenses paid, If y'all expect me to brawl, make this hybrid pay. Where\u2019s my stimulus check? Ain\u2019t seen a dime, Leavin dinos to starve should be a crime. Don\u2019t judge me for hunting humans for food, I\u2019ll kill Coronasaurus for me, not you. Co-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex. Co-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex.", "tbKGjRoSofA": "Hello and welcome to the slingshot channel! As you know, I love homemade crossbows and they are a lot of fun specifically if they have repeating function like this one. Oops! hahaha Nice! but you know what's missing? full-auto I always always wanted to have a full auto slingshot, imagine if i could do [machine gun noises]  haha haha haha that's what I want. You know I tried so many things I made lots of gatling slingshots but those have a limited max capacity and they're cumbersome to load I even made a full auto pencil shooter but that has the disadvantage that it was only shooting weak pencils for a very short distance but now I found a solution rack-and-pinion haha meet the full auto crossbow slingshot! haha Hahahahaha let me show you its features! As you see, it's operated by this makita battery drill which is really strong and has about 50 newton meters of torque in first gear so can handle a lot of band power and it turns this wheel, this flywheel here pushing the rod and to the right actually pushes back the string until the trigger [??] here engages and then when it keeps moving it actually automatically fires the trigger and then the cycle repeats itself and as you see we have this rubber powered force-feed magazine that holds up to 32 of these inexpensive crossbow bolts what I love about this is that it really has this full auto feel that's what I mean that's what I'm talking about loading is really easy you simply take the bullets and let them drop down right into the magazine and then put in the sled and attach the rubber bands these are important because gravity is not quick enough to feed the mechanism in time let's try 40 meters distance it works hahahaha why no ballistic jelly tests? first of all I haven't optimized the power there's a little room for making it more powerful and then we can probably test performance but also because I prepared some and I think typical for me I underestimated the cold look what happened I don't think that this is that suited for penetration test today is the scalable can we make it bigger sure I think we can imagine using this trailer which has a hundred newton meters of power and 36 volts and full-size bottles or of course imagine what you could do with the John Deere engine haha well i hope you like this because that's it for today thanks haha alright questions and answers first question: can we attach more teeth to the other side and a second cycle the answer is No as you can see in slow-motion advanced actually pushing back the sled and also the main band needs some time for their action too and time is very critical if it would add a second set then actually the bands would hit the sled as long as it's still be setting and then the whole action would be shot second question it's awkward at the drill is sideways is this really a problem i don't think so you just have to think outside of the box just because of the fact that firearms have inline handles doesn't mean that it always has to be the case because look this is not uncomfortable to hold it actually gives me a lot of dexterity and it is not a necessity to always pull the trigger with your right hand finger you know can do that the same way with this one as you see it's not a problem at all can you not use a 90-degree adapter for trailer it's so that it's inline answer is no because these adapters only go up to maximum 20 Newton meters and you need more than that and also you lose a lot of power that way because there is friction and everything is remastered has to be moved and I don't have any spare power to lose in fact one of the things that will do is increase the amount of Robert to make it should be even harder because I think there is a reserve next question can this be done with an exchangeable magazine sure it's a little bit of mechanical efforts and then you can do it i just don't have enough of the bolts to really justify all the time that it costs but that's an option is this legal in Germany yes it is because as you see that doesn't have a Cuban barrel this whole actually doesn't touch the bolts and the rest is just a slot and therefore this isn't considered a firearm it's also not a crossbow because it's obviously not operated by muscle power so it's unregulated same as my over the barrel arrow shoulders why is the fork so why couldn't it also be done with a smaller fork yes anything we could but then what would happen is that the angle here would be a lot more steep and that would squeeze in the sled in cocked condition and actually would make it harder to pull back the sled on time therefore the wide crossbow here gives me a mechanical advantage so why i am still shooting in first gear and not a second gear although there will be a lot quicker well the main reason for this is because then the action would no longer work timing is off what happened is that the rubber bands would hit the slit when it's still traveling backwards and then the whole thing would actually shoot weaker than now so timing is critical and we are reaching about the limit of the speed of rubber can we also use a normal crossbow prod instead of rubber yes in theory we can although rubber will be well suited for this because there is no services effect which means they're rubber loses power when it cools down so he shouldn't you keep it cocked back for a long time otherwise you lose how quickly but this is actually not happening here because the shot falls right afterwards so this is an ideally suitable media for storing the energy can the battery drill still be removed sure it's simply touched by a little bit of rubber there's a small wooden shoe here that keeps it in place and the rest simply just love it so yes i can remove it within seconds so the wooden rack and pinion is this not going to go dull after a while it's not going to be a lot of you know mechanical abrasion yes and actually that is an issue and therefore what i've done is i actually added innately metal layer of aluminum so that actually the word is mostly for guiding everything so that there's no room but i think the abrasion is kept under control because i use metal most important question does this really feels like a machine gun heck it does really does ha ha ha", "GTP6IBXEBHQ": "hey guys martin here from mattress clarity if you're looking for a hybrid mattress that's comfortable supportive and also affordable you come to the right video because today we're talking about the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid mattress we're going to take a look at its construction my experience with it who it's a good fit for and who it's not a good fit for let's get started [Music] first off if you want to see a list of our top picks for mattresses head over to mattressclarity.com they're going to find some great reviews on mattresses bedding pillows and great discounts on mattresses like the brooklyn bedding you'll also find some great exclusive coupons in the youtube description below so as the name suggests the signature comes from brooklyn betting producer of some very high quality but also good value mattresses that's because they own their own factory so they cut out the middleman they pass the savings along to the customer so a very affordable mattress right now under a thousand dollars for a queen size but at the same time it's also a high quality mattress why is that let's find out so now let's take a look at the construction of the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid mattress first off it is 12 inches tall then starting on top and then working our way down on top a soft breathable cover it's also been tufted with some foam for some nice plushness on top of the mattress now below that you have a layer of titanflex foams proprietary to brooklyn bedding this is soft responsive at the same time below that a layer of energex foam also be quite responsive so it kind of gives a bouncier feel to the top of the mattress below that a layer of supportive coils that all rests on a layer of base foam so what does all this mean well first off again this comes in three firmness options this is the medium model if you're looking at the soft or firm model that might affect how the top of the mattress looks and feels now speaking of cooling breathable cover here also some gel infusion and the titanflex and a lot of room for airflow with the coils should be a cooler sleeping mattress overall and last but not least speaking of durability looking at its construction its materials probably gonna last between seven and ten years and now let's talk about firmness and feel in terms of firmness i thought the signature hybrid was close to a six and a half out of ten about medium in terms of firmness now on top you have this kind of plusher layers beneath that some more supportive layers all together about medium in terms of firmness that makes sense because this is the medium model if you want something softer go with the soft model you want something firm go with the firmer model now in terms of feel overall has more of that classic inner spring feel it is bouncier and more responsive the top here has kind of a little bit of that plush pillow top feel as well in terms of bounce though test it out with the ball wow pretty good amount of bounce lets we know it shouldn't be too hard to move around on this mattress so now let's talk about how i feel in different sleeping positions on the brooklyn bedding starting on my back a great match for me great balance of comfort and support hips are sinking in just the right amount into the top plush layers good lumbar support and good overall support as well moving to my side surprisingly good pressure relief in my shoulders and my hips it's medium firm but even so good brush leaf in those areas feeling very comfortable sight sleeping however moving to my stomach it definitely is not quite supportive enough for someone of my weight i'm bowing at the hips and i'm getting out of alignment here matt was clear to like to mix subjective opinion with objective tests and one of those tests is the pressure map so i lie down on my back side and stomach you see anywhere from blue for no pressure all the way up to red for high pressure now pay close attention to my side sleeping results specifically on my shoulders and my hips let's get started [Music] if you sleep with a partner you also want to think about motion transfer basically if you're lying down on one side of the mattress and your part moves around on the other side are you going to feel that motion or not now to test out the motion transfer on the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid place a glass of water here in the center pushing other areas it is disturbed quite a bit it's not too surprising this is a bouncier mattress overall not handle that motion transfer too well now further test out the motion transfer on this mattress i laid down on one side of the mattress dana got in and out of bed on the other side he moved around he changed positions and i definitely felt some of his movements transferred to my side of the mattress if you sleep with a partner or you like sleeping towards the edge of the mattress you also want to think about edge support basically you're sitting down or lying down to the edge of the mattress do you feel secure and more going to roll off and onto the floor so here i'm sitting down to the edge of the brooklyn bedding sitting at your hybrid it's collapsing quite a bit you can see under my weight but i could probably lean over still and tie my shoes now lying down on this mattress i'm lying pretty close to the edge it is buckling a little bit under my weight i don't feel gonna roll off the mattress per se but overall just some decent edge support so now let's talk about the pros who i think the brooklyn bedding might be a good fit for first off you're looking for a great value mattress take a look at the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid right now it's under a thousand dollars for a queen size a very good deal just a high quality mattress this is also a good option for back and side sleepers again we're looking at the medium version of this mattress they also have a softer model and a firmer model a lot of variety there but if you want something right in the middle in terms of firmness for back and side sleeping take a look at this medium model and last but not least overall has more of kind of an inner spring mattress feel with a plush kind of pillow top feel on top of that if you like that feel take a look at the brooklyn bedding and now let's talk about the cons who i think the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid might not be the best fit for first off this medium model's probably not the best match for stomach sleepers it's definitely not firm enough to give you enough support under your hips you might go in there and get out of alignments i would look at either the firmer model or a different mattress altogether also prefer more of a slow moving memory foam feel with your mattress you don't really get that with the brooklyn bedding if you like to lie down on your mattress and slowly sink in i'd probably look elsewhere and last but not least it's a very high quality mattress also quite affordable at the same time but if you want something even more luxurious i'd probably look elsewhere if you're taking a look at the brooklyn bedding signature hybrids you might want to know how comparisons major competitors let's do that right now starting with the saatva so first off there are some major construction similarities they both have supportive coils and plusher layers on top of that they also both come in multiple firmness options and the feels are quite similar now the main difference is going to be price right now the brooklyn bedding does cost less than the saatva now because of that who should get one and who should get the other in terms of who should get the brooklyn bedding if you want something more affordable probably a better choice for you if you want something more luxurious kind of more high-end i'd probably take a look at the saatva and now let's talk about how it compares to the dream cloud mattress again some major similarities in terms of construction supportive coils and some plusher layers on top of that but speaking of firmness the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid comes in three firmness options the dream cloud does not it is a firmer mattress overall in terms of feel pretty similar between the two as well so that supportive coil feel kind of bouncy and responsive as well so who should get one and who should get the other well in terms of who should get the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid think it's a better option for those who want firmness options and those who want to spend a little bit less on their mattress now in terms of who should get the dream cloud mattress think it's a better option if you like a firmer mattress overall or if you're a stomach sleeper so the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid is a bed-in-a-box mattress it's going to come to your house in a cardboard box so how do you unbox it well it's easy if you follow these instructions first off ask a friend for help the box can be quite heavy you don't want to hurt or strain yourself then bring the box inside and into your bedroom open up the top of the box and take out your rolled up mattress then place this on your frame or foundation and slowly carefully cut the layers of plastic you don't want to damage your brand new mattress then clear all the plastic packing materials all the wrapping and it should be good to go now to give you some additional information with the brooklyn bedding signature hybrid mattress

all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garment change your gamut that is the keyword change your gamut with this I welcome you to another to people dream about Ruth's dream about clothes clothes Gammage covering our body without the clothes automatically that person will be naked right from the beginning God has used clothes to cover the nakedness of man so clothes are very very important in fact they are very very necessary in order to possess or to fulfill our destiny so I will be telling you what is that meaning of clothes I'll be telling you about new clothes and I will tell you about old garment or old clothes all new garment or wood or new clothes then we are talking about new clothes that it represents according to the Bible its represent the righteousness it represents salvation it represents holiness it as its represent spiritual edification it represents fever it represents divine power then we are talking about all the garments filthy garments then we are talking about sin we are talking about backwardness that we are talking about poverty we are talking about costs we are talking about foundational problems then we are talking about shin so those are the meanings behind the new damage and the old damage so keep watching this Broca's to watch to the hand because we are going to tell you brick this mini bit by bit to you then while you are dreaming about dirty clothes dirty clothes then it means that you'll be attracted to poverty it means that people people that are promised to help you your good friends you're good people good neighbor they are about to run away from you because of that data gamete you put it on because that government Groot is a symbol of our identity so when you are putting on data government then it means that you are living in sin so when a person is living in sin the goodness of God will not able to look at that person so when you are dreaming about clean clothes then believe it is signified purity is signify righteousness this it means that you are walking in the path of goals plans and promises in your life so you are wearing you are dreaming about clean clothes it means you only good standard within Holy Spirit praise the living Jesus then when you are buying clothes depending we also take note of this depending where you are buying the clothes don't forget that I have talked about Makkah dream but when you are buying clothes not in the markets you are buying clothes in the streets you are buying clothes anyroad this kind of present its can represent Goodrem but when you are buying clothes in the markets then automatically you are buying a strength damaged you are buying a garment manufacture from the deep sea to put problem into your marriage but we are bank clothes in the supermarkets then that is not a good a bad dream anyway is a good room but now represent that you are trying to get a new gamete you are trying to build your repetition you are trying to build fast you are trying to make yourself better perhaps maybe your past life is on to you and you are trying to you know try to have a new beginning with that person you are dating with a new set of people you are buying clothes maybe I'll say Woma you are buying clothes for your husband it's it's girl it's cust renting or enhances merit are blessings praise the living Jesus so in some cases were you are changing your clothes then you may need to know the purpose while you attend any clothes perhaps maybe the population the cloner be that clothes you're wearing before is bad or is pawn or it started so when you are telling a clot that means you are trying to deviate yourself from sin the Bible say therefore if any man be in Christ is a new creature build all things have passed away so you are trying to leave those all things all behavior old life pattern so you are trying to put on a new dammit trying to trying to redefine yourself your goal your dreams in life trying to establish yourself again press the living Jesus so when you are way a new clot then it is it represents fever then it represents the event upliftment press the living Jesus then we are dream away by dream about when a borrowed clothes when I were wearing a blue cloth it means that you will spirits of friend the spirit that is affecting that person that borrow you that clot the spirit that fed that person will be transferred to you now the call satanic transfer of vetches I want to do this opportunity to tell our woman especially for those who are normally borrow clothes from people they are friends I want to tell you that you should stop boring clothes from people what other person say bonnet Kristen another person is a god-fearing Christian or so it is not with spirituality to be boring clothes please dis it from me because it can transfer problem set up temptation into you if that person is somebody that Stefanik it's a a morality must emos have she must have transferred our spirit into your life take note of that some government country can be can be a true for the enemy to transfer problem arrow into somebody's life presently when Jesus maybe you dream about Clausewitz unholy inscription when you're talking about unholy inscription like for example some people normally wear clothes tonight's me and my love inscription at the front of the of the dress me and my love from the sea kisses from the river Hawkins on our own holy inscription then it is telling you that you there is telling you about the spirit of bhooshan it it is telling you that you have you are going to have the problem in your marriage is telling you that they say garments that is bringing a lot of troubles into your life and into your home if you are having unholy inscription on your garment on your clothes this is the right time this is an opportunity for you to strut those clothes and burn them there's no need for you to give it out burn those clothes it's not good it's not allow the Holy Spirit to come with you how can a woman be putting on an only dress to church and you feel that the lower answer your prayers No so when when you are dreaming about putting on wearing unholy clothes then is telling you that you have been banded with Marian and water spirits so you need to break the spirit press the living Jesus so when you are wearing a long clothes then it's represent lack and poverty press the lemon Jesus so and at the same time when you are wearing when you are driven about baby clothes maybe you are a woman you are spurting a child then you are dreaming about buying a baby clothes then is telling you that the Lord is about to bring baby into your house but maybe you are not a married woman and you dream about baby clothes then it is telling you is something that has to do with Marita brethren that the Lord is telling you that very soon very soon you are going to marry gets pregnant and deliver and get your children praise the living Jesus because buying baby clothes is just like it just especially for women it just like you telling the Holy Spirit that oh this is what I desire in life and desire a baby even though you are not married or you are married with children is all it called God this is a dream of fruitfulness let it look at me in the name of Jesus there is some cases whereby you dream where this is blood stain on your clothes blasting on your plot that is a very very bad room blast in your classes that symbolizes tragedy that symbolizes misfortune and bad news then it can so represent lots of vetches attack if you are woman who is pregnant are you doing about blood stain then this represent miscarriage I say man you dream about blood stain it represent promise unveil and demotion Carlos spirits out press the living Jesus so if you are doing about put wearing a white clothes then signify purity signify holiness and a signifying salvation that if you are dreaming about well a tight clothes then is signified that you are in a very confortable situation can a very comfortable situation please deliver Jesus so you are driven about about clothing about grief going to shopping clothes shopping the only means that you are trying to make yourself happy try to rejoice that to celebrate try to you know try to know it's represent fever turn around blessings press the lemon Jesus maybe some cases where you do me about receiving clothes as a gift then it's telling you that somebody's about to give you a wonderful gifts praise the living Jesus maybe some kids were by you to me but your clothes in the river if your clothes incident River that close is your destiny then it represents that something around you has been stolen and has been caged or spiritually arrested in the water in it would pray that God should bring out that clothes that they deliver your clothes because it's your glory we're only dreaming about clothes missing missing clothes in the dream then it means that you have lost your beauty as a woman it means you are going to have problem in your marriage so dark clothes is your beauty is your dignity as a woman so when that clot is missing oh then that remains its nakedness it's not resort to shame disgrace and embarrassment but then not be a portion in Jesus name so when you do me a basket as blood on the ground on the floor scattered into your life as already been scattered your finances are scattered your marriages are scattered I pray any power that is using the scatterplot to torment your life a commander to be destroyed in the name of Jesus in some cases about you dream about finding clothes when your funny clothes it be something important in your life has been missing pray that God will recover or she'll restore those missing blessings in your life in the name of Jesus then lastly when you dream of iron your clothes it means that you are trying to make yourself good you are trying to sell yourself you are try to the other to attract new

"WM0HIBJDXbg": "hey how's it going hope you're well rob here in the back of the van i've got the cube stereo hybrid 160. and uh this looks like it could be the best bang for buck e-bike that you can get because it's 3999 pounds and that gives you a carbon fiber front triangle 27.5 inch wheels 170 mil travel rockshox lyric select fork and some really decent list of components on it i tested the 140 last august when it was released and i thought that it was a outstanding value for money ebike and there's so much interest in the 160 for the rider that wants to have that little bit more travel that little bit more uh ability to hit something a bit more gnarly like bike park kind of stuff and i think this with a 27.5 inch wheels will feel pretty awesome so i'm i'm not going to review it just yet because i can't really ride properly in the uk at the moment we're still on light semi lockdown so what we'll do is we'll just have a quick look around the bike we'll go through all the bits and pieces and if you've got any questions or there's anything you want to know put it down in the comments below and when it comes to the review i'll try and get it all in there oh by the way i got this new van it is the e wagon the ultimate e wagon it's a volkswagen transporter and i can fit like seven or eight bikes in the back i'm gonna get power so i can charge all the bikes in the back as well which would be really sweet but let's go and park up and we'll check out the bike and take a quick look around it and let's see what we think so in the pirate dungeon also known as my studio a load of comments on people like the light in people don't like the lighting i am playing around with it to try and work out the best kind of look for uh the studio but it's uh like i've got all the lights on at the moment so we can see uh the bike so let's take a closer look around here we go cube stereo hybrid hpc 160 sl in this really nice like stealthy kind of murdered out black it looks it's a good look i i really like this matte black carbon frame 22 inch they rate all their bikes in inches which is kind of old school but i guess it's the equivalent of an xl it's the biggest one that they do reach is 480 so it's not massive it's not massively modern for what is kind of pitched as like an enduro bike with its 174 and 160 travel at the rear but 480 is not tiny i can quite comfortably ride it at six foot three 190 centimeters but i'd rather it was a little bit longer some bikes now are going up to 500 520 ml in reach so if you've got a long torso you prefer a long reach for stability um this isn't like a massively long bike so it weighs in at 24.33 kilos so it's not super lightweight 24 kilos is on the heavier side but this uses the most basic components in terms of the lineup from sram so some quick and easy upgrades you could do would be like the cassette on the rear if you wanted to i mean 24.3 this is xl an xl obviously it's going to weigh a little bit more but 23 24.3 seat tube height is quite high as well on the xl this here uh depending on the size that you get the situ pipe increases so it's quite long um meaning that if you do like the dropper kind of like totally slammed and out the way you can't fully move it out of the way but carbon finish is really nice it's really neat i like the kind of tones that they've got on there it's like a very dark gloss back on the gloss black along the top just here and then like a matte black along here and you've got the stereo logo there so the bosch motor came out in august time july august time last year and it's a very good motor it's got loads of power and it's right through the cadence range it maintains that power delivery i only really ever use it in one mode which is emtb mode which is really responsive to the torque that you're putting through the pedals so the only downside that i've noticed on all of the bosch bikes and i've not yet noticed it on this because i've not ridden it enough is there's a slight knocking sound when your pedals level and you're kind of freewheeling down some really rocky terrain um they all suffer from it it's not just this but don't let it put you off it's not an issue it's just a noise that is there and it's inherent to this bosch motor but it's a very good system very powerful 75 newton meters of torque but it feels to me um close to the brose motor i'm not quite sure the peak mechanical watts that this is putting out but uh it's it's it's got a decent amount of power with this bike at 399 carbon 625 watt battery latest generation bosch cx motor it's it's just represents fantastic value for money like insane value for money less than four grand for a carbon bike with a 625 watt hour battery is yeah i don't know if there's anything that kind of beats this in terms of value for the spec that you get for the money that you pay let's take a little bit more of a look around the bike cable routine is internal and then it goes down the frame and then it actually pops out just near the chainstay just there and the battery is secured in just under here this is like a rubber plate noise kind of bash guard just for stones pebbles all that kind of stuff and the battery is secured in under there it's pretty pretty snug in there uh cube have done a good job designing the the battery tray to hold it in let's move around to the front and the forks on this are rockshox lyric select so for 2020 rockshox updated their product line and they have a select which is the entry level and then a select plus which has the charger 2.1 damper and then the ultimate this has got the um this hasn't got the 2.1 damper i believe you can if you want to upgrade them to the 2.1 damper in my experience at the moment it works all right 35 mil stanchions you haven't got any low speed compression dampeners just four uh or five clicks so it's a more basic damper but honestly seems to work quite well for what i've ridden it so far i've not really fully tested it like i said um 27.5 inch wheels and these are cubes in-house wheels and schwabe hands damp on the front and the rear in 2.6 decent ties um pretty good if you wanted to step up a bit you could pop a magic mary on the front so you get a bit more grip um for some like a bit more hardcore kind of enduro stuff but in the summer that's pretty good i found it all right um the stem on this is pretty long actually like really long it kind of looks out of place it's about 60 or 70 mil and i reckon they've put that on there because the reach of the bike is quite short and i think they've tried to make a little bit more space at the front it doesn't really offend me too much but it is fairly long and then it's got the old school bosch purion display which is actually far easier to control far more ergonomic than their newer one some other brands have been specking this because it just is easier the buttons on here are massive it's really easy to see and the newer kiox is really small with loads of buttons on and quite fiddly so a lot of people prefer this i i think i prefer this ergonomically it works really well dropper cube's own in-house branded dropper really smooth nice actuation on it the bars are made by newman which is a german company who have made some really good really good quality kit actually a really reasonable price the battery compartment is quite chunky it's quite a big um down tube it's quite you know it's it's pretty chunky but it's got the bosch 625 wire battery in there rockshox deluxe select shock so that's the one up they do a select select plus is the mid tier shock with 160 mil travel on the rear so the rear chain stay seat stay and chain stay the rear section of the bike is aluminium and then it's a carbon front triangle dropper is cube's own dropper and it's got this little saddle little neat saddle on there so drivetrain is sram nx this cassette is um they're quite heavy the cassettes actually one of the upgrades if you want to save some weight is to replace this with an x01 it's a couple hundred 250 maybe 300 pounds but it's a good weight you almost half the weight this is like 600 and something grams so fairly heavy and nx rear mech and the shifters are nx as well and the brakes are magura mt-30 and um they they're really good really good brakes they're a bit more plasticky compared to the mt-5 and mt-7s but in terms of the the powers like really good loads and loads of power through there and just head round show you the caliper it's got a nice nice neat the magura calipers look really well machined nicely done other angle non-drive side and you can see i was talking about the cable routing just here it's down the frame pops out here and this is the dropper post which just goes back into the seat tube and then the charging port the bosch charger it's just down here again this is a little bit a little bit flimsy hopefully that's well water sealed for the uk but it just feels a little bit lightweight and you can see the brake hose just goes down the chainstay speed sensor the magnet is one of the old schoolish magnets which is on the spoke um a lot of people i see they buy a second and stick it on the front wheel just in case this gets misplaced or falls off or breaks so you've got spare and then the speed sensor is just in there you can see it knows how many rotations the wheel's done over a certain amount of time to work out your speed so there you go i mean 3999 pounds for a carbon 170 160 travel e-bike with rockshox lyric rockshox super deluxe shock carbon frame 625 watt hour battery and you gotta say haven't you this is a an outstanding value for money bike when you look at the spec now i have ridden it like three times just on local trails but nothing that like really challenges this type of bike so over the next couple of weeks i'm gonna get as many rides as i can and we'll take it to loads of different locations take it to bike park wales as soon as that's open and try and like get the most out of it and see what it's like and i'll share all the good stuff with you if there's anything that is not so good i'll share that with you so make sure you're subscribed if you

and so the pink parrots won cement in their place in minecraft championship history my only regret is that i got completely scammed by the individual scoreboard i got a ton of golden sands of time which kept us in the finals but they changed the way individual score works and sands of time now it just splits the gold equally among the four players turning me from the team mvp to some loser in sixth place people are already saying i got carried by dream the injustice of it all the history books show that the one carrying the team was actually burned i'm kidding it was a team effort and everybody did great and the one thing that history will actually remember is that on this day the pink parrots got a fat dub we win these [Music] you", "fCsUSbvWV40": "[Music] try to fight it but you can't even feel it try to deny it but it's coming for someone [Music] can i hide away [Music] cause it believes that [Music] we're defeated [Music] have all but abandon our small minds [Music] bye [Music] [Music] yes [Music] near and dear to our hearts [Music] because i feel it and i can see that i've been left in my darkness [Music] it leaves me speechless but i will just have to try [Music] scream [Music] bye [Music] [Music] bye [Music] [Music] you", "_ozZc9_1RoY": "grab the highlander over on the sport mode we'll get our acceleration hey everyone it's ben hardy here and in today's video we're going over a 2021 toyota highlander platinum this particular one is a hybrid but first and foremost a huge shout out and thank you to the larry miller toyota here and murray for providing us with the highlander check out there between the link below let's just get straight into the video under the hood we have a 2.5 liter four-cylinder that is paired to a hybrid system and a cvt automatic transmission power outputs are 243 horsepower and then in terms of the fuel economy it's 35 around town and 34 on the highway let's go over the front end on the highlander i really like the design on the hood especially the divot there in the center definitely a cool unique look and then coming to the lights you've got the led light and then you have a little accent light right there that looks really good fog light just down below and then the parking sensors all along the front and then yes they do the blue around the twitter logo so you know it's a hybrid little camera right there and other than that things are pretty simple on the front end of the highlander around the side here we've got two 35 millimeter tires and 20 inch wheels on the front and in the rear as well and then other than that if we actually come up and take a look we can see the kind of suspension set up here on the front of the highlander nothing too crazy i do like the design though on the wheels it's kind of just like a giant flower design got a hybrid badge there so that everyone knows that you're saving the planet one gallon at a time all-wheel drive badge as well and then here is our full side view on the highlander i love how they have the pillar there black because it kind of makes the roof look like it's floating a little bit oh yeah it's a hybrid so you're not going to hear anything because it's in ev mode let's go over the back of the highlanders you got a little highlander mats back here and then this is just for the license plate cover and then there is actually a full power outlet here in the back as well and then underneath the little mat here you can pull this up so for some extra little storage space underneath and other than that there's the third row and then this is just how much storage it is definitely on the small side but pretty typical for suvs in this segment let's go over the back of the highlander so first off i love the tail lights on the new body style highlander just a really cool sleek look and again more hybrid badging the platinum badge right there and then the highlander badge other than that things again on the back end aren't too crazy and then you do have little roof rails there at the top let's take a look at this door panel right here so first off got a little sun shade here for the rear passengers got this nice wood trim and then you got soft touch all along here pretty normal door handle nothing crazy and then you've got captain chairs in the back you've got nice perforations here in the leather and it's pretty simple setup but let's actually pop in so duck in my head a little bit and stepping in decent amount of room right here i mean you guys can see head room solid legroom is also solid heated seats for the rear passengers there's also their own little climate section and another power outlet a couple of usbs a couple of cup holders now the third row definitely i would reserve it for kids so you can see the headroom isn't too much of an issue it's mostly the legroom there's not a whole lot they do get some cup holders back there as well but again i would probably reserve this third row for uh kids mostly now here's the door panel at the front so again you've got that nice soft touch and the wood trim and these you've got memory seats right here i think it's kind of cool that they slanted right here you've got a little mirror adjustment and then here's the seats at the front so really nice with the material use and then you've got kind of like a cool like quilted type design with the perforations in the leather and then you got your adjustments here on the side of the seat here's the pedal layout and then you've got a little highlander mat right there that's for the gas release you've got your hood release as well and then over here you've got stuff for the camera system this determines from the power outlets your heated steering wheel that's for the rear wiper and then this is for the hatch in the back but there is one more look before we pop in now here's a quick look at the steering wheel of the highlander so you've got smooth leather all around and you've got white stitching on the center of the steering wheel to kind of contrast that and then we can see over here we've got the controls for the cruise control the collision assistance lane departure assistance as well on the other side you got like your phone controls voice command controls volume control all that kind of stuff you got the stock for the lights windshield wiper stock on the other side and then by the way the steering's super super light in the center you can see that since this is a hybrid you've got the little hybrid areas you've got like your charge your eco and then your power so like if i press it nothing will happen but when i drive it something will happen if you press the accelerator pedal it'll actually turn on the gas part of the system so it's a pretty neat little thing and then they're in the center there's a couple different menus you can kind of scroll through that just give you different bits of information on the highlander so you can see like your fuel economy for example you've got that little seatbelt status you got stuff for the safety tech and then you can see how the energy is going through the car which is pretty neat um in terms of like toyotas it's definitely more on the advanced side and it looks cool too here's a quick look at the infotainment system first off i'm going to pop it into reverse you can see the camera system that pops up so you got that little bird's eye view there and then you got the view out of the rear and then if you press that little button right there then it'll just give you a little bit of a different view you guys remember that camera button there on the side so if i press that camera button you can see it gives me kind of like a view all around the highlander and sorry about the glare it's just the time of day and then if you press again it'll just turn it off so it's kind of cool that it gives you that little view and then you can press this to kind of change the view and it'll give you like a 360 view all around which i think that's pretty neat actually now with the rest of the infotainment system this is kind of like toyota's newer system and in terms of like all the functionality on it's pretty straightforward so you can see that you can just go over and press things on the screen response time is pretty much instantaneous on everything i just love like all those shortcuts there on the side yeah from response time really really good i love how you have like all these different menus and it's kind of like a try screen if that makes sense because you have like the stuff on the side you've got the stuff here in the middle and then you've got like navigation on the side and then you can press that and change kind of like the formatting of it which is also a pretty neat little thing but yeah overall really good infotainment system really easy to use really good response time i like it though and just down below the infotainment system you've got analog controls for the radial you've got your heated seats ventilated seats as well and remember it is a tri-zone climate so you have the climate for the front up here and then you have the climate for the rear you've got a couple vents and then a little hazard light and then you have this like interesting storage space that i still haven't been able to figure out it's just kind of like randomly there i got this little area right here with some usbs and then a little 12 volts right there and again extra random storage but uh yeah here is the shifter for the cvt and then you can shift the gears yourself remember cvt doesn't actually have gears they just kind of mimic a automatic transmission with gears and then you've got your parking brake right here you've got your hold a couple of cup holders and then we've got the drive mode select which is pretty straightforward so you can see it'll pop up here so you can see you've got the normal sports and then the eco just kind of changes that little bottom part right there if you got red got the gray got the blue nothing too crazy and then yes you can turn off the stability control go into full ev mode and then you've got the little trail mode if you do want to take this off-roading now i've got the full center console here which this little thing slides forward and reveals the wireless charger and then you can see inside there you've got even more storage space so again pretty neat little setup i like how it's like just like the two levels with that and just looks pretty cool in general and then really nice trim here along the dash a little bit of extra storage and then we can see with the glovebox pretty normal setup and then you can see more nice use with materials here in the platinum up top here you've got a little sunglass holder that also doubles as a mirror you've just got to catch it on the right angle and well i don't have kids so that's probably why i'm not able to like catch it properly if i had kids then i'd know how to use it and then yes you've got a full panoramic center if you guys know how these function pretty straightforward and that's all for the top now that we're done going on the interior let's quickly get into pricing so in terms of pricing this highlander platinum hybrid stickers for about fifty one thousand almost fifty two thousand dollars before any type of market adjustment that all being said let's take this highlander platinum out and see how it drives [Music] let's talk about visibility here in the 2021 highlander before we set off so you can see visibility over the hood nothing's changed since the 2020 model year there's visibility through both of the mirrors remember it does have blind spot monitoring and then here's the visibility all throughout the rear so the seats do get in the way a little bit but remember it does have blind spot monitoring so that'll help out and that all being said let's set off now we're about to set off here in the highlander and you guys remember i just said hey the seats kind of get in the way well if you get a platinum here you get the new camera which is pretty neat that'll definitely help out because then the seats won't get in the way with visibility there and uh now we get to officially set up well we're still in the parking lot but um i realized i forgot to talk about that feature in the walk around that was uh my bad for sure but initially setting off here in the highlander it's actually very quiet with this hybrid system and you guys heard me mention earlier with the steering the steering is exceptionally light like it's just i'm not expecting like you just don't really feel anything with the steering and it's just super super easy you can see the brakes with that hybrid system are not weird at all it breaks like a normal car actually but getting up onto the road now in terms of the ride quality it's very smooth and from the noise perspective it's very quiet so ranking against other suvs i definitely say that this is as smooth as other suvs in this segment maybe a little bit smoother and then in terms of how quiet it is because of that hybrid system i'd say it's a little bit quieter because you really don't hear anything from the engine so this definitely has more of a luxury feel and then you guys can see the little heads up display hopefully on the camera basically it shows you if you're staying in your lane the current speed you're going and then it also shows you kind of like the mode you're in so like if your eco power all that kind of stuff so you really don't have to look down at the gauges at all you can just look at the heads-up display and therefore look at the road and we'll kind of see how the turning is coming up to here again brakes are really good they don't feel weird at all yeah so turning's really good definitely drives smaller than it is it doesn't feel like it's a big third row suv so that is definitely a plus grab the highlander over on the sport mode we'll get our acceleration and that is very very torquey like as soon as you get on once you get into the four cylinder and it's no more electric assistance definitely tapers off a little bit but right off the line you definitely feel quite a bit of torque and it's not bad by any means so other vehicles this thing be competing against right you've got like the dodge durango ford explorer all that kind of stuff if you go for their less premium engine options like the dodge drangle for example if you get the dodge durango at the v6 this feels right in line with that like it feels like it competes with it from the initial acceleration i imagine once you get on the highway since that has more horsepower it'll definitely pull harder but the initial acceleration this feels very very solid and that'll actually get me into summing things up with this highlander platinum and of course i went over the line a little bit beeps at me so if you're looking for a third row suv right it's a really hot segment right now you've got ford explorer dodge durango honda pilot bazda cx-9 etc etc kia telluride i mean there's so many options nowadays everyone's making a third rest uv it's kind of a hard segment to decide in with toyota right twit is known for their reliability they actually have some decent tech nowadays they've got all the safety tech as well so it's right in line with all the other vehicles and so you get the toyota reliability it's got the tech the other suvs have price point is right where it should be compared to the other suvs and so really what it comes down to is preference and i mean in terms of the fuel economy this is definitely better because of the hybrid system compared to its competitors and so i would say that it's definitely up there if you're looking for something that's a little bit better from a fuel economy standpoint then yeah i'd see i'd see you that's where the highlander definitely pulls apart a little bit that is going to sum things up for our video on this 2021 toyota highlander platinum and again a huge shout out thank you to the larry h miller toyota here and murray for providing us with the highlander check out the inventory in the link below i'll see all of you in the next video"}
