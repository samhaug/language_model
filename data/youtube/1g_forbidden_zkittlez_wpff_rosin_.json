{"a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow

everybody jpeg here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick taste test dab review featuring washington state's knott's cannabis we'll be reviewing their lemon og this is some hash rosin i'm pretty excited to check it out i haven't had washington product in quite some time and so to be able to get my hands on some of this i'm pumped check out the packaging here we go and this is actually a brand new product hitting the market in washington we've got it hitting forbidden cannabis retailers throughout washington state and i've got some test results here to share with you guys let me go ahead and show you a little bit of the the rosin that we have here and then i know we got to stir it up so i did a little bit of warming action before we before we got going in here and so let me go ahead and get a nice whip going oh wow the smell on this is insane we're coming in hot at 2.4 total terpenes let me go ahead and scoop as much as this as i can on to the nice beautiful here we go lemon og some really really nice hashtags and check that out there we go and thc 65.88 total cannabinoids seven point i'm sorry 77.72 so in terms of uh in terms of rosin is it the most potent on the market no but lemon og is known to be more of a mild og you get these light citrusy notes this herbal flavor and of course the classic pine that og kush brings to the table so for this one here on the scent you definitely get that sweet pine and you get citrus notes as well there's even this sweet and sour and so i'm excited i'm excited we're going to do the one today i'm going to do two dabs so let me get a nice chunk of it here and then i'm gonna do dabs two ways we're gonna do a low temp dab how i normally dab a cold start and then we're gonna uh we're gonna clean that up and then i'm gonna do an opposite you know regular size or a regular dab where we heat it up first and then we count it down so here we go taste test review not cannabis i hope you guys are ready man wasn't just what a time to be alive man canada is from multiple states this is an exciting this is an exciting time here we go so again i'm a cold starter here we go all right there we go there we go oh wow that flavor is incredible sweet piney herbal you even get a little spicy the terps on this are actually surprisingly pronounced meaning they're right on the front as soon as you inhale it you get terpenes when you blow it out you get a different flavor profile it goes from inhale sweet and piney exhale this sour not necessarily gassy almost easily wow absolutely delicious in terms of a taste i've got to give this taste test this is somewhere close to that 9 9.25 range you know it's not like all strains or all you know flour cultivars that are out there or whatever you know they don't all have to be tens i think for what lemon og is the potential for that strain is roughly somewhere between a nine and a 9.5 on that taste test that scale out of 10. can it really be a 10 i don't know but for me i think this dab this this this particular version of this hash rosin absolutely delicious and so i really would recommend you guys try that out now we're going to do a regular dab where we heat it up and then we count it down and then we load the dab in on this other method this will give us a score out of 100 we base it on 10 categories we're based on 10 categories it includes presentation appeal it includes all kinds of things so we're going to get this just nice and heated up and clean burn it off real quick see if there's any residual oil looks like there was just a little bit just give it one moment here and see this is the reality for so many smokers like i'm although i do dab daily and i certainly enjoy rosin just as much as the canosaures i just don't invest heavily into super nice glass i know that it definitely affects the impact and impacts the flavor but the reality is is this is going to cool off and hit it and i personally will not notice a big difference between it and excuse me for being as ignorant as that may sound but i love dabs and i love dabbing the way i dab so here we go this is gonna cool off i'm gonna go ahead and revisit the the view on this look at this right here this beautiful hash rosin all right i know i'm definitely not gonna dab all that so i'm gonna stick to a nice healthy size right here we're gonna wait a little bit longer i don't want to burn it too much all right all right here we go good time for you guys to like follow and subscribe below check out knott's cannabis on instagram check out respect my region here on youtube be sure to

is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be talking about this kind of restrain in front of me this is skittles with a Z at the start and at the ends and we're gonna talk about it in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker Channel let's talk about the background of the skills cannabis train this is a really popular one for gem family and Terk hogs all involved with the creation of this strain it combines Grape Ape with grapefruit to mix those flavor profiles and it really does deliver a unique strong delicious sweet and fruity flavor the tagline for skittles is taste the rainbow and you get that with a flavor of the skills bud but also with the appearance as it's growing if it gets cold just before flowering it develops these nice purples it's just super popular from what I can see looking online doesn't it like you can get the seeds or the feminized seeds so clone only virgin family gifting Terp hogs one of the cuts of skills and the legend was born all right so I know there's gonna be a lot of searches for skittle so this is probably going to be quite a popular strain review I'll refer you to my research sources in the description in a video but it's places like wiki leave seed finder and several other sources just to try and get a background of this strain this particular batch of the skittles is some of the best I've come across this is organically grown in living soil using the no-till method of growing big up to Roadrunner really really nice skills this and I'm looking forward to covering it in more detail let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain so we've got the skit was here let's ever look at it I like the brand in I like that skittles sticker there taste the strain bro opening up the glass jar to look at the skills contained within yeah well not as many colors on the but as I was expecting actually I've got our flower from this grower that has plenty of purples and plenty of different colors on the bud this is more of a single green color right it's got the green sort of loosely stacked calyx a lighter color Asian dusty Huai comes the pistols are visible for troodon from flower as well let's get another nug out and just to see what the rest of them are looking like what singular colors you know so when I was reading about it was talking about how it it's got all these different colors but I would say that that isn't showing in this bit of flower nice trim job the buds been presented well I'm impressed with a look I wouldn't say it's as complex looking as some of the other strains I wouldn't say that it is jumping out at me as wowza this deserves its complete reputation based on look a low but well presented organically grown sort of buds got their own unique structure and shape it looks good but how does it smell I like to open a jar and just get a whiff of that gr smell and this is where the true skittles flavor really starts to come through the aroma is so identifiably skittles that you can just tell as soon as that hit my nostrils and that is what gives it its distinguished ability amongst the other leading strains out there you can smell it and know what you're smelling where is love a stranger might be like oh it could be this could be this this is skittles and you're gonna know their skills when you smell it what does that smell Intel it is a mixed sweet fruitiness that combines the grapefruit and the grape together it kind of comes across like a sweet sour citrus kind of combo which starts in the aroma as like a bag of sweets but then as you inhale deeply you start to get the citrus notes like creeping in it's a real pleasure to to smell this one so really really nice smell guys ten out of ten in terms of the smell I've smelt a fair bit of Skittles this is some of the nicest smelling skills that I've tried I could literally just stand like this for an hour just smelling this and just enjoying the sensation wowza one hour later excellent excellent expression of the skills of Roma in this grow we're gonna break this up and just see what smells are released inside here we go Oh exactly the same but with a wolf that comes from pungency that wasn't as available before so you're still getting the sweet you're still getting a mixture of those fruity flavors it's got an American smell like a Cali inspired sort of smell to it but it's very kind of natural and pungent that kind of skunk enos just coming through right at the end as you do a deep inhalation let's move on to the taste section of the review I've got my bong here we're gonna smoke some bombs of the skittles and see how it treats us I should also get a vaporizer we rounding up some of this skills to enjoy I have been smoking this really a while so I've tried it in every consumption method I really like it through the bong I really like it in a joint as well it's a nice smoking to join the skills this section of the video is all about that flavor if you are joining me for this one get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs really de briques heated up we're about to smoke and vape some of the skills cannabis strain but my vaporizers are heating up so that is going to give us a brilliant idea of that vaping flavor in the meantime let's smoke our bowl of the skills and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] I was so smooth and light I didn't even do the ball [Music] Wow what did come through was that it was flavor and actually I reckon it is down to the method of growing that organic no-till method of growing delivers such a nice smooth smoke and a strong flavor profile and this is one of the nicest sort of no-till grows that I think I've tried to they really enjoyed that flavor no need to cough no sort of acridity by in the chest just tasted them really really nice we're gonna do another one in a minute first of all we're gonna try the mighty vaporizer let's get an idea of how it bakes really skills e on the exhale or still now like the roof of my tongue is getting this skills flavor coming through like super strong super super strong [Music] that is in my top five will vapor straight away straight away Wow again I've got shout out the no-till method of growing Wow's our paint so top marks for flavor as well let's talk about the effects of the skills skittles is an indica dominant strain it's a hybrid obviously you've got a sativa of the grapefruit in there as well but it's listed as an indica dominant strain it doesn't mean it just sits you down and relaxes you straight away now first it brings you up and you get an almost sort of creative Drive something you could literally clean the house with but this doesn't last a long time if you don't catch it and start being active in those first few minutes as you start to experience the higher then the next stage settles in and it will take away that drive because it is a relaxation it's a heaviness it's a suit ly to that afternoon and even in tire smoke and it's something that actually for me is very very strong but also makes you feel a little bit chatty and a little bit sort of lifted as well how am I feeling right now it's time to kick in nice and fast I mean the vapors got a really high absorption rate clocks in between 15 and 23 percent THC there's not as strong of those super strong ones but I said it isn't everything sometimes it's the mixture the cannabinoids the terpenoids the flavonoids everything feels really really strong despite it sitting around the sort of 20 ish percent mark and yeah on the indica side but feel nice in the mind as where you know is that the hybrids do they combine the good effects on both ends of the spectrum I can feel the waves kicking in I've only had one bong and a vape of it and it is in odd I can feel a lot of tightness in my like around my eyes I kind of like headband but more around my eyes let's sum things up today I've been enjoying the skills cannabis Train organic no-till big up road run up we're about to smoke another bong of it right here on a channel join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] taste me it really comes fruit and I'm really late the flavor of that appearance-wise it looks nice maybe didn't bring out the Purple's because the stable temperature is a nice looking bit flower smell wise fantastic 10 out of 10 it's a really really nice smell it's like sweet notes there's like sour notes you know it's really complex flavor-wise the smell carries right through into the flavor vaping it is absolutely fantastic smoking it tastes great as well when it's a really smooth smoking experience I put a lot of that down to how well this particular batch has been grown and effects wise it's a lovely heavy stone for that afternoon even in time something that I will be enjoying when I'm sitting down playing video games or watching something on Netflix for example and yeah I'll write it very highly that is gonna be it for the skittles strain review on the I smoke channel I know some of you are going to have some stuff to say about this strain so what are your thoughts leave them below and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying our content to help the channel grow that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep talking step 9 your roller coaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "AwEqGWo7dag": "all right where we out here growing for rosin growing for Roz and then I've ever grown strictly for rosin man there's entire Gardens which I mean there's whatever idea whatever 240 watt or 400 light Gardens right strictly all for extract we've seen it cuz what do you extract or he had that with the death star right it was like a work for me a seven percent extracting strain awesome flavor and everything percent by weight yeah that means yeah throw an ounce in you're getting you're getting more than a quarterback Holly that's yes sir that's a producer I don't believe it guys somebody tell me wrong in the comments show me some stuff I guess I just called the extractor a liar but no when you're growing for rosin there's a couple different phenotypic expressions of the plant that you're looking for because the the main thing and we talked about this on Wednesday the plant waxes that make up part of the trichomes right different strains can have different like ratios of plant waxes to cannabinoids making up their trichomes and ideally you're looking for a very thin waxy cell wall around the outside of the trichome so that instead of there being a ton of waxes they're either extracting or are getting left behind and you're not yielding off of you're getting all cannabinoids coming out of this question here because what's up everyone I just purchased a new rosin press no smasher which we talked about before for you he's one of those little on one press is a pretty decent price I'm looking forward to playing around with it I have just read results from pressing rosin or I've just read that results compressing rather than have a lot to do with the strains my next girl will be a heavenly influence for pressing rosin so my question is what's at the strains work best for rosin pressed are there any type of characteristics I should be looking for in a strain and what will make for better awesome so this is about to pop up you see let me just kind of say what lemon because they put a lemon GF here right made a great a great some good information yep so just absorb this case says people say hash strains and things like gorilla glue number for supposedly high yielding and if you search for ever strange I don't even tell me that my whole life man what's that sorry I've been just trying to make commentary I'm just trying to fit in did any quality strain covered in a decent amount of visible trichomes should do well but the results can vary massively from different phenotypes and a strain pack of seeds from what I've seen with varying consistency of yields for each right so keeping cuttings of what performs is very important this is where you go back to growing if you're a rising grower you're probably not playing around too much with I'm gonna have you know you're gonna grow this ain't like a production grower you're gonna grow all the same strain to a degree if that's the one that really works for you but 11g F goes on this talks about different temperatures I appreciate this really good information the difference between a high temp and low temp and pressin and then I think a lot of people lean to for the most quality though pressing that bubble hash like one step further when you're making that bubble hash you freeze everything make your bubble hash like ice hash right our ice water hash and then you freeze dry the bubble hash that you've made so that you're locking in all those terpenes none of them are able to volatize off and you're just taking all the water out at freezing temperatures so pretty much then you can press that and that's like what they call live rosin you have a freezer oh are you making up things now I I do yeah it's been like three grand along the oKed I'll be right I've rosin I didn't even haven't heard that one yet new thing yeah the ice cream place but like I was saying the different phenotypical stuff you can look for in the plant and then there's hormonal things you can do to play with the shape of those trichomes and how they actually how they are there's certain like plant hormones methyl Jasmine 8 being wise jazz monic acid methyl Jasmine is just another name for Jasmine ik acid if you're using that in gibberellins and you'll have to do your own research and experimentation on this to find the right dosages and everything they can plant up they can [ __ ] your plants to where you have like footlong foxtails but if you use them correctly in the right dosages you can start to play around with the shape of that trichome and make it a bigger trichome that is also filled with more cannabinoids and with less of a waxy cell wall around it so there are some hormonal things the plants look like hell when you do this to them uh-uh like that they do foxtail but like completely out but if you think about it when a plants Fox tailing rapidly right it's putting trichomes all over the fire tail injure when we're we're not we're service that's right more surface area more trikes and as an extract grower we're not looking for back appeal on the plane at all it doesn't matter at all what we're looking for is the trichomes it could have annoyed terpene and flavonoid yield from the plan yep and we want to try and minimize the amount of waxes that are coming out with it because either that adds another step you have to do acts and clean up this the extract you've made or you're left with waxy paraffin waxes and that stuff people don't want in their shatter I was gonna say it if guru didn't matter I think we did it I think we covered it I like it you guys check out that post there's some really good information thanks

the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh yeah that works in this life so clean we have a

to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my

two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't

i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "mTsoEEmz7Rk": "hey guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron

back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "-t7wYRlkFVY": "yo what's good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com back with episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out

triple XL g flour rosin just straight flour we're only at stage two stead of two more stages to go we're at 2,300 pounds of pressure we're running this at 109 degrees or under 90 degrees we just breached up to stage three we're still pressing we're gonna scoop this to collect or again where if you guys just joined us one of bras endeavor so we're at stage three and counting each stage is about 53 seconds the liquify time was 30 seconds 160 second total stages total cycle 45 46 thousand 46,000 pounds on the on the game we just went up to stage four so we're at 7,000 pounds of force which equivalent to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds 75 tons of pressure under a hundred and thirty one hundred under 130 square inches of surface area it looks like this is definitely going to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the parchment paper under there when we are at Stage four we're fitting it fish finishing up this full cycle you guys just joined us is more we're here at a stiched area here shooting a function video this is what the will be you're going on YouTube the self collecting we're at ninety three percent ninety three percent runoff so you got eight percent maximum amount of oil being stuck within your your your parchment paper so there's no need for scraping it's almost all self collected yeah we just finished the cycle we're back at home so let's pull this out it's for what have we got in the oven here what do we got okay that's quite a lot of oil I mean that's a quarter pound JK there was a twenty eight grams per bag for bags let me lift this up and show you guys what it looks like [Music] it's just these pouches every single time they come out like this", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a

with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will

harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at

[Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one

whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty

smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the

back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "deCgAlfn3mg": "and then also I'm going to talk about our forbidden fruit gonna be the total opposite side of the scale here it's gonna be an indica incentive that sativa like the lemon tree this one here is a cross between cherry pie and tangi and I know what you're thinking I know you're thinking is Pangea sativa it is but the cherry pie the indica I'm not is going to overpower the tangi a lot but you're gonna get a lot of benefits from the tangi the color it's gonna be super purple with those orange hairs and you're gonna love that a smell it's gonna be like great fruit smell it's gonna be tropical and super citrusy so those are the flavors of the vendor fruit really you're really gonna pick up the grape fruit set when you smell a forbidden fruit like you're gonna be like what is that but it's great great trust me it's spot-on it's crazy the effects of this one it's gonna relax you make you happy euphoric those are the top three it is also gonna make you sleepy and uplift it I have this kind of count balancing I've lifted and sleepy but it's gonna knock you out that and it goes it's gonna take over that sativa and you're definitely gonna feel that unconsciousness the medical effects of this one it really helps with stress depression and pain we also have insomnia like I said it's gonna knock you out and muscle spasm some so if you get muscle spasm this is gonna be a really great strain for you relax your body and they're not gonna occur as much dry mouth so the main one think anyone can say with those we do get cottonmouth so I mean of course it's gonna be your daughter dry eyes again dizzy you might get a little dizzy anxious and headache so I'm with both these strains you are gonna feel it in your head they are gonna be some strains might feel a little bit of a pounding or painful feeling that's just the strain it will relax you and you will go to sleep don't worry about that painful little headache you're getting it's the relaxing indica that you're gonna want", "dc9wL5oTNWE": "[Music] Cannabis itself has been has been consumed for thousands of years and ever since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "7_nwzupVrZA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] aha [Music]", "6j7OeSoYJEA": "hey you there welcome back everybody this time we're gonna be doing another hard press demo doing more hash as opposed to the other video I think was more flour probably all flour our member yeah I'm gonna go out to the sit room to write have the hard press setup and then I'm gonna show you a couple of things that I do maybe differently than the next guy and yeah I'll just take you through step by step it might not be quite as long as the other video that I ended up losing but it should still hit pretty much all the points I think so let's go check it out alright so I'm gonna do a hash run obviously two yellow bags like I said before we flip them inside out or there's a little funnel hmm forgive that on camera here so that's how I just pour some hash in there the bags are flipped inside out you know I didn't get this thing on fast enough to see it starting with about 40 grams of hash and they think I'm gonna put it all in about ten bags and then so we're gonna press about eight grams at a time yeah we're gonna fold these over to you can watch them fill in these okay I actually if I'm pressing with the hair iron I do prefer to make like a little patty first mm-hmm and like a pre squish flatten it out and then put it in the bags I think that works a little bit better for the hair iron but it's just a little bit faster because we're doing you know more than one press shut this thing heating up I don't think it's all ready yet still got a couple degrees to go you know you can just just press them do the fantasy this is what I've been doing so I don't like that bag open so we just give it a quick heat it kind of seals the bag up just like so so that it stays flat when we put it in there ten of them will get a squish wrong for you how I squish this thing's a little bit warm that's what he's able to squish them it's not really even that hot yeah is it it just turned this thing on it's obviously still got about 70 degrees to go I can still put my hand on here so it's not even 120 degrees yeah still working though this couch is really good though so if we let me show you what I do because I know people have been talking about blowouts happening with these bigger you know five and 2010 presses if you don't you know kind of ease into the pressure I know if you got like a hydraulic or pneumatic press it's a little bit easier to kind of punch it in there but this is like a little bit of a learning curve I imagine and we're back I'll tell them of the envelope so that this flap isn't gonna open up on me and like I said you can probably fit a lot more in here too if you gave it that pre squish you know I usually take like a piece of parchment paper and then all you know flatten it out with the hair iron and just get it into like a brick form just just warm enough like if I was smoking it not really too getting we'll just to press it up you'll fit more in here and I feel like yeah it's a nice like no blow out feature too if you're having blowout problems I feel like that having it all together is a good start to have with this thing it's got two plugs I know they have a one plug version now but I I mean I can go back and probably get them to do a one plug for me but I kind of like it because I plug in the heat element first and then I can just leave that on while it ones up takes about 15 minutes I'm just sayin it's about 15 minutes and it looks like we're still about 30 degrees shy so we'll be back when that warms up all right yeah so I got them centered in there again it's about eight grams with the other plates I think we can get up to like 12 or more grams with the single plate on there this thing keeps on bobbing up and down I'm just gonna go I think the temperature that we got it's about 161 I'd like to go about 180 but you know it'll be 180 in a minute we'll see what the difference is again this thing takes about 15 minutes to warm up I just turned it on not too long ago yeah so the problem people are having with hash is that it's blowing out because the hash can be a little bit too good I mean if you have anything really over three stars with your pressing four and five six star even it's going to end up squirting out the seams in the screen you know before it gets the adequate amount of pressure to keep the bad stuff in and the good stuff out so you've got a kind to ease it in and with the hard press there's just you know two buttons so you've got to stop it by yourself and that's like a double tap so I'll go in to where the pressure just barely gets on it like I'm not hearing any of the sounds of the press actually happened I'm just getting it there and I'll let it sit there for like ten or fifteen seconds and then I'll go in for another 15 seconds with all of the pressure so it does it is a kind of a learning curve you kind of gotta hit it at the right time so after a couple tries we'll figure it out it's not that hard but let me show you what I'm talking about [Applause] like that and as you can see nothing's really terribly sweating out yeah a little bit starting to go now we're gonna go in with the rest of the wait and see what she knows and that's what we get looks like no bull outs that was five stars is like between four and five star smells really nice I know if you're getting that yeah it's really stinky for sure thank the pineapple was amazing yeah so again that was four or five star if I would have just went straight in on it it was definitely one of like pressed out these little scenes on the side of there and if you're not flipping these bags inside out that's going to be it's going to happen a lot more easily too so we'll put that off to the side make sure it's centered getting that it's definitely getting hot now my house again we're gonna do the same thing see it's fairly starting to come out it's like the juiciest part of it just kind of want to get it to separate so that the harder stuff kind of coagulates together makes it hard to press out the big screen there we go you can tell these are kind of I mean when they're done you can see they don't look slick sticky or glossy you can see the screen kind of separates from it instead of it being kind of gooey like this in the middle so I mean you can always come through and press these a second time and I promise you you'll get on what what I would do is even double them up so like you come through the second time we just put two of them on top of each other like that and then just stick it through the machine I'll show you another way that we can get even after doing that we'll get even more out of them on a different day it's kind of you know if you're trying to get your bend most bang for your buck I'll show you how to do that too it's a different time if that looks like a really fat squeeze in the middle there and we're gonna finish these up and we'll be back for the collection I'll show you guys how I do that all right all right and we're back you got all these pressed out here see just that distinct and we're gonna collect it up and I'll show you how I collect them up I just let it sit here for a minute it's about sixty degrees in here so it's not super warm not super cold but you know just not super warm is important and after letting sit see pretty much just all comes off to the one cage and I mean this is and that is definitely the thickness that I would have this being it's a nice color but as this gets is gonna be really thick this big yield and that's gonna end up darkening up as we get you know more on there now there's a little bit left over on this one Karofsky put it on over here put a little bit of hand heat yeah you really don't need any of those expensive rosin collector glass presses or whatnot this is pretty much how I always do it works really well it was really fast [Applause] it's usually the edges even a point one but this is nice and sugary it's gonna look like flip that one over good handy and again this was a pineapple express bubble hash it was kind of I guess full-spectrum mush obviously the 70 and 90 wasn't in there there was a little bit of five-star 120 in there but mostly it was a four-star like the 37 you and the 25 you like I said thicker this thing good next one goes this is a by far like one of my favorite Rogers right now she really holds the flavor I mean the the parable expressed with some generals of Terps of just bananas I mean former concentrate you make actually haven't done dry sift of it yet but I'm willing to bet that it would jump or the church would even asked flippy-flippy it so importantly at the edges I guess you want to make sure to get it all in one pool and you don't want it too cold like I said about sixty degrees seems to be really nice 65 even if it's too cold it'll be too shattering and if it's too warm you know it'll just melt a little place and stick all over the place and I feel like people would other things people use their like a cold stone so you could take you got like a cold cutting board that's made out of stone he and put that in the freezer for a little while and set these on top but again I feel like that gets it way too cold and I also feel like any kind of freezing like sticking stuff in the freezer is is just it's freezing it then when you take it out all the condensation that's in the room is gonna stick to your rosin or go in it just like you like when you get out of the shower so if you're gonna use any kind of like cold things to make your rods and hardware I would use like the UH fridge for sure seems really dry in there and it's not cold enough to cause condensation usually unless it's just a you know unless you're doing rosin in the bathroom after you take your shower all right I'm gonna go through these really quick looks like this about it sat on it and so we're left with this giant like torpedo here it's like almost a mask look up in the sky it's Rosen man yeah sorry yeah so oh my god that's off camera so I just folded the sides in again whoa when I you know when I if I end up breaking this down will you know I'll make grams will repress them so there's nice and thin and you get that nice gold color I can manipulate this right now and you know and essence start whipping it up and in turn like just the nice gold metallic color it's weird how that happens to it looks like almost like metal but I just want to get weight on this it's a nice little slobby nice little slab or nasty it's always exciting to smoke definitely Rosen episode hold on alright so it looks like 25 grams it's not gonna let me oh well well yeah it's about 25 grams least if I could figure out another way to get the skill on that I don't know what that is as far as percentage its end up being you know 55 between 55 and 60 percent I'm guessing we're gonna go in for another press - that is definitely not all we'll get out of it I bet I'll get another final 5 grams or so out of the second press and then but then coconut caps or caramels or pretty much anything you would put in Jenny had a bowl or anything you would do with oil that wasn't gradient sticking all right well I hope that helps you and your rosin experimenting I will probably go back inside and smoke on this here I'll take a little piece right here let me show you what I was talking about like if I sit and I pull it like Laffy Taffy it's better with the big little piece but I want to keep this stuff kind of shattering and I think this is gonna this is a butter Apple smoke this right now another piece just like right now but it tried it you know it's Laffy Taffy it up real gold got that gold gold look I mean it really looks like metallic gold to focus flash it's kind of making it should make it clean I wish it would focus when I do that ere we go I'll stay focused right there like those gonna focus right maybe it up but if you can do a big glob of it I swear it just looks super reflective and nice I'm gonna go poof on that that smells amazing be back in a second all right let's try this again is a pineapple slab alright alright 25 something Lance the dabs we took all right I just wanted to thank don't make it right now okay so we're back inside and let's see I weighed that stuff for you and I'm sure I put that in on the way out just to make sure that you guys saw and this is I just took a small portion of that and you know check it out for myself I'd end up falling off my desk - shattered a bunch but that's all right flash really is yeah stuff is really really really white life is really making it the dark of it as you can see once it's pressed out it's pretty pretty nice it's a little bit warmer in here now so at least it'll be work better to work with we'll take a hit off of that I ended up doing the math too and we got about 64% on that first press I was pressing a really really low temperature if you saw so I probably could have got a teeny bit more but I'm always going to go through and I'm going to do my little trick to get I don't know probably get between 5 and 10 grams more off of all of that stuff and then we'll have that either the coconut capsules or or some caramels or something cool like that but other than that I hope that really helps some of you guys out that are maybe having problems with blowouts with your hard press I really tried to cover that well like I said it's it's kind of a learning curve but once you get it it's really easy I would definitely look for them to maybe implement something like that maybe not I guess that's fine the way it is yeah I wanted to make me take a Bangor hit too [Music] Oh then we'll put it on there that way it will end up knocking it all off again I could with this way looks like a decent dub I'm gonna bust out the nerd glass in cycler bang your hip banger still looks pretty good let's see this thing uh takes like I mean I'm still had about a minute of this poor old banger if I want a nice really chirpy hit I don't know that's kind of a big one Wilson definitely want to taste a really good one that if you guys want more milk make sure to check out a couple of the other videos on the channel always Melton ups a good hat probably about it and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below down in the comments or you can check out the information or playlists it's where I put the most frequently asked questions and terminology that we use you in community so we'll wait a minute for that I was thinking about making a new playlist to kind of one just for the hard-pressed it seems like it's a pretty popular subject so I want to make sure that I can direct people to that playlist so I'm gonna maybe take a look at that right now I'll probably still leave the other videos up in that playlist but maybe better like that and we still got about 15 seconds all right pineapple express rosin made from bubble hash Cheers oh yeah nice and smooth oh god that nailed us routines crazy crazy retention on that thing we've always had and get in here while this thing's still kind of hot just wait back here whoo yeah that was a brain clear forgot what I was doing for a second definitely nice smooth smooth flavor on that definitely got the pineapple coming through I could have probably taken a a bigger one than that but that's still really rocked oh my brain I'm definitely happy to see that rosin has come around full circle it's it's it's part of people's cannabis experience now and that's awesome I think it's a great alternative it's safe for everybody to do and it can be amazing if done right so that's about all I had to talk about I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "Wwy0yvQkMO0": "[Music] what a guy's welcome to the CCC I'm Shane and I'm Danny we're back again for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 laughs and this stuff looks fire man the rosin we've been getting our hands on has been super fire and it's a treat today we've got the doctor ladybug GMO flower to compare directly to one of the best representations of the concentrate that's a pretty rare that we get the chance to sometimes it's like we get a certain type of hats whether it be a particular strain and then we're able to try the flower sometime down the line or we may have tried it previously it's pretty rare to have a sample of some flour and some concentrate of the exact same cultivar for us you know lately but we have been smoking this GMO a lot we've been thinking about doing a review for you guys like we just haven't gotten around to do it yet we're good but we figured we kind of throw a little mini review of this in with this GMO rosin that was press Peron does it say what micron bubble hash this was I don't believe that I assume it's like nine here ones one or 73 so basically GMO the strain itself is a cross between chem dog and Girl Scout cookie as you guys know if you've been watching this channel for any length of time that we are huge chem dog fans this particular Cross Lanes super heavily on the chem dog side which is something I like hold on when you look at the smell the structure it's definitely super kendo Oh God that is crazy every time I dab GMO lately I'm just like what the hell it's like it's almost like it gives you a little heartburn it's so pungent I didn't think we could give you heartburn in a good way but it's just got that like back in the throat huh oh wait it's like a real really big it's not like a plunging like sour like fruity or like a diesel II smell it's very like dick and musk it almost like coffee you know coffee is like a really big yeah smell but this is more like a Sharpie turb kinda like I mean down there's a lot of hints of a lot of different kind of complex smells and flavors and Terps going on in here but I've been a huge fan of this weed since the first time I tried it and any time I can get my hands on a good batch like this dr. ladybug I usually do you got to try that robot really high but it's almost like that it's a little bit much a very high but it's not a bad jittery it's just like that I need to reduce them you know say like I need to go be active it's very cerebral in the head that it's also got a big body part it's almost yes it's definitely gonna lean heavier on the indica side in the normal sense of like what you think indica means as far as being relaxing superbee this strain is super good for pain relief but it's not like a knockout smoke it's not gonna you know make you super sleepy it's functional but it does have a lot of the good traits that we tend to think of as traditional yeah indica traits as far as the good pain relief appetite stimulant for me personally this has been a great like all-around daytime throughout the day any time of day textmode yeah honestly yeah again I hate the whole indica sativa thing kinda as far as from a marketing standpoint because I like like I said I like to judge everything as I hit it this one's honestly hit me like right in minute like you said it's a it's a everyday smoke morning noon or night to me it's pretty it resembles a hybrid to me I don't know what they're really calling it I realize it's kind of the best of both worlds yes it's the best of all worlds got me very creative but not too sleepy not too jittery so yeah I mean I love the high on it honestly it's really nice this stuff came to us as like a really tacky shatter almost and it buttered up from over 90 yeah those guys can see the close-ups it started off completely translucent thank you like you would see it pretty much right after it was pressed you know it stayed temperature controlled and you know they did a good job getting that from beginning processed the way they wanted to live it to the end consumer and then what we do with it on our end is on us yeah you know we kept it out we didn't put in the fridge or whatever it's completely buttered up now but when we took the close-ups yesterday a look incredible we goofed it guys we does n't matter literally this whole of joggers getting smoked in less than what 12 hours right you know so I'm not really too concerned with it but yeah I can already tell by smelling this it's an exaggerated version of that I'm expecting it to taste like an exaggerated version of that we'll find out yeah I'm gonna go out and I'm popping this jar on the dr. ladybug GMO so and I wanted to bring up that it smells very garlicky and I know that there's like garlic breath up there I know there's garlic cookies and others GMO cookies I'm not really quite sure they all smell they're very similar but this right here is the loudest and most garlic theme of them all this shit's got me super scrambled but this right here is the most garlicky all mo raw it doesn't just taste like that smells o3 airs I got even a smoke kind of smelled like that smoke smells amazing a little treat I couldn't hold back I'm gonna go home and we're going on longer for this right here so this is the kind of [ __ ] I don't care what the [ __ ] haters out there say this is the [ __ ] that deserves a little review oh so far this is so far the bug right here it's it's definitely you know I think it leaves more on the chem side it's definitely got that dirty feet funky fuelie fuming I don't know the best way to describe is just that funk that canvas where I got the word pom-pom when I yeah funky weed it usually has some Cameron this stuff this straight funky dirt I can we're getting the really good Kennedy from up north and then they kind of 91 chem over it's Ann Curry's the creme Buchanan for a while when we first got our medical carts back in the day that's definitely what I look for I'm looking for those nostalgic funky root Bewley crazy gassy Terps with the chemicals that takes me back to that a day you know and with this weed right here the reason we've been smoking this on us lately is because it's exactly what I want is this as far as the body smell it takes just the overall enjoyment when I smoke this yeah this is the exact same thing alright guys sorry gonna take a little halftime break there I guess this stuff the buzz on it is a little more strong than we were intending it's kind of like kind of like an OG it just kind of keeps going up and you don't know where the ceilings gonna be because I'm pretty high right now I take no more dad and then we're gonna rate this [ __ ] oh you're going in for that second Devon yeah I just got this so long I got a good one on a second one yeah it's a rarity for you these days I'd really like to take two in one video especially two bangers so that should tell you guys right there's something about this [ __ ] right here some day it's like the type of stuff were like you're already where you want to be but you end up I'm just smoking more just because you want to taste it I just need to flavor again and the flavors that's a real thing right sometimes you smoke because you want to smoke you want the field you know you want to feel I might as well let's just be honest yeah but then there's some times where you're already where you exactly where you want to be and I still want to smoke more it's because you just want to taste it I I'm stealing your gone I'm gonna take one of these blowing it up with two nice well my timers hitting this so we're just gonna race the music up in the window yeah this stuff is really smooth though it doesn't make it expands your arms and it makes you cop a little bit if you know what's on my first step there wasn't much of a cop this stuff is really smooth for some rosin so I'm digging feel like there's been a lot of tins being given out lately yes what do you think it's another one yeah goodness I don't do up the DJ Khaled oh no then another ten honestly there's some stiff competition on this string and I'm gonna say that I've had one representation that was a little bit better it was the Papa Berkeley it wasn't rosin but it was GMO it was full milk but it tasted just a little better than this I'm not gonna lie and there's some stiff competition so you know I feel like our ratings have to get a little bit stiffer I'm giving this one a nine point five everything's tens the flavor just to be a a bit more little more that stuff I remember that as some of the best bubble hat I've seen this year sure it's crazy it's crazy a time football mashup in this browser but I promise you if you tried both of them I think you would agree and yeah I don't know man I haven't find I would like to see someone make yeah I don't know if you could make better rosin from that bubble than this right here you know I'm saying yeah this to me is about you it's about as good as it gets because then the flavor on this is already crazy to me and the flavor on this was just like a slightly more exaggerated cleaner version of this and I like this dream because it it's one of those strains that tastes almost exactly the way it smells so like kind of gives you that he like ride the whole progress I've like smelling it breaking it down packing it is smoking it and it's like you get the smell and then you get the taste and there's like brings it full circle bias in there it's personal opinion all right for sure I tried that at cauliflower and it was the first time I actually dabbed GMO extract that could be playing on it could be the first time I just got that crazy GMO term and extract form but you know what this stuff is amazing I'm still giving this stuff a 95 percent rating so that's pretty good they built a and this stuff is awesome pickups in 710 labs now and they are killing it right Sutton standards definitely so I'm seeing from you know watching them out in Colorado when we were out there and you know seeing what they were doing out there and then watching what the way they've been able to transition out here and what they've done in the last like year and a half two years has been really cool to watch nothing up some 710 labs for sure yeah and we're far frozen they definitely smoke graves I think so I mean we're definitely going to have to get great be with them I love them linked up with smoked tons of curve GBP Swisher's all day do all the stuff down there that you're supposed to do right now like like comment subscribe turn on notifications hit the bill do that little thing yeah and let us know what your favorite purple strain of all time let's do it right now brilliant I'll be back next week with another one of these doing the same thing yeah same table same guys whatever different we though what's your name Shane mine Dan mm-hmm later see you know what just a plain row always give my day on all night but I'm the running back jet and you know I'm gonna run all know we have fun for the right price turning the Friday night we're going 18 dummy to the sunrise no wise from the dank smoke but I run a reserve with my tank for what we just trying to have some fun", "EXmdM_f69u4": "what's up guys baked with you for 20 here about to get into a strainer view on this forbidden fruit but before doing so I'm gonna take a rib and then show you guys some close-ups of this bud but um and so then cheers guys let's get it [Music] [Music] and a little video of their broken down there at the end but about the identity finishing this bowl and then after that I'll get into talking about the astral genetics to the bud which was actually pretty difficult to put together but I'm gonna do the best I can for you guys so uh cheers again folks hope you're enjoying the strain review thus far but uh cheers guys but uh Cheers all right so this forbidden fruit from what I found is supposed to be a tangi crossed with a cherry pie reason I'm going with that it's because it came out of cookies I said that was the best strain review that I saw some dude was talking about a tangi cross with a cherry pie and I strongly believe that mainly based off the smell when you pop this thing open it just smells like a straight nectarines just those little tiny oranges what are they called cuties yeah yeah I'm over here at the McMuffins house they already blazing on a little do be um let me spark up this bowl yet again I'm cool you guys can go ahead and handle for now so where's the books it's just ridiculously Dargis almost black and I would say if I had to guess it would probably get that for you a cherry pie cherry pie is a f-1 herb cross with a granddaddy purp GDP is a really dark strain so it'll probably get it from that I would say but the smell taste in the fields I would say it's really dominant on the tangi side it's very uplifting very talkative makes me kind of somewhat racy as you can see but it honestly it still manages to relax you and kind of glue you into your seat so it's kind of a social blood you know you can sit there and smoke it with people it's really enjoyable very tasty something you could definitely smoke all day and not get tired of but I'm gonna get into another rib because this [ __ ] is dang cheers guys only thing I said that's the first time so we got one more ball packed but we're gonna try and get in just as much information as we can all useful information on this drainage we can cut as I was saying it's supposed to be tangi and cherry pie cherry pie is a very well known cookie strain little cookies cousins a very very popular hybrid along with the tangi Tandy's pretty well known from DNA genetics you know how long with be real who's been growing since the 90s but uh it's it's a very good smoked something like I said you can smoke all day you can definitely get up and go from in your room and do whatever off the smoke as well as just relax and watch some TV you know but um [ __ ] other than that what I'll start to cover I mean I got the whole flavor the legs showed you guys what it looked like then smoking on it all night I go back would I go back for it definitely especially for the price I actually got this blood for thirty five and eight thanks for asking that question that was a great question yeah that was at the taco sesh if you guys haven't seen my taco social video be sure to do so one of the booths that was that I should have recorded because this guy had just endless strings and you know it was just three different rows of maybe 11 to 13 jars on each row and literally each row had some they don't want us to take home you know but I was just bound to choose two strains the two that I chose we're this forbidden fruit and the Death Star and this forbidden fruit man it just blew me away just looking at it how dark it was but it's still managing to be just covered in THC super fire but um yeah I would definitely get it again cuz this is something that you normally see for like 50 an eighth but I got a 35 so if I can get this for 35 on the regular I'll definitely do so but I'm gonna see if I can't get this whole bowl smacked in one rip it's packed down super fat so I don't know if I'll be able to do so but it can use the lighter on this one don't have quick try and get her done let's get it Cheers [Music] [Music] oh my gosh whoever grilled is to by the way shout out to you you did very well very smooth very white on the hash he did great on the flush I didn't ask I should have as far as where I can get this on the regular but man if I had to write this but one out of 10 I'll give it 11 it's great it's something I definitely hope I can see in the future if you guys like this strain review be sure to give this video the thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already I'll see you guys next time until then peace", "LlrJgCBATaY": "what up y'all chill boy bacon babe I just want to bring you guys a quick video showing you some different rosin I just got this gorilla glue rosin back from my boy who vac purged it for me because basically I collected on top of some dry ice and so the rosin collected moisture so you threw it in the back of him for me and as you can see at that fire fire looks really good really nice color see right through it so there's that one and again people will say that looks dark but it's funny because this is a gram actually this is a little over a gram and this is the same thing straight up clear but yeah oh the dust and the hair and it that people think right my shits clean so there's that right and then this will give you a different view so there's that and then I've got some of this gorilla glue which is the stuff that I've been smoking on for the past couple weeks and this is a thick little puck right here but it just goes to show you kind of the different consistency that you can get there's kind of squeezing this down just from how stuff cures you know this stuff is more stable and then I've also got some black sugar rose rosin that I pressed out earlier today it's a really low yield err so I don't really do it often but I got a gram and a half off of just under 10 grams so that's what I normally get around 12 to 16 percent of the range I think I've pulled on it it's got just a really cool color to it it's really stable grab this here you get y'all just breaks off so it's super stable and so I'm gonna go ahead and actually take a hit off of that I'm gonna go ahead and close up this big guy here close that up and that's about 36 grams right there so I'm gonna try and get you guys a cool shot of me pretty much dabbing this and the clean email hopefully I can cut through here clean get a nice strip off broke all right so you guys can see what that looks like and let's see if I can get this for you and this is fire [Music] superbomb super stable all right peace out", "CM7BgO_-Huk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Mina

growers didn't have access to information so it was a real like under the radar I guess you would call it a hobby at the time the lack of the proper machinery and the lack of someone who can produce it sometimes with our industry it's one of those things if you want the right thing you got to make it yourself [Music] the first tumble I try really hard not to beat up the material because it's lead to key Keef to rosin looking through the side of the machine and as soon as you start to see the hairs and a lot of green then you got a cut it [Music] I can look at it if the heads are big and they're shiny they're like diamonds they'll reflects light even if it has these big green specks if it's still shiny then it'll press better than like something that's super blond with no colored contaminant because the oil in the big heads is what we're going after it's been a really integral part of my life my entire life since like sixth grade back then it was like you got to take it into your own hands if you're doing it yourself and you can't go to a store and buy what you need we make Matic heat presses that are designed around the process of extracting rosin most of the plant matter has been taken out of the active component of the plant and so the smoke is a lot cleaner and a lot stronger the overall focus of our system is just to make sure that the end product is the highest quality possible-- [Music] [Music] Rasen compared to some of the other products as far as concentrates on the shelf I would say has an advantage one because it's it's a completely solvent less technique 2 because it gets a good snapshot as far as the terpene profile of the original genetics that it came from the overall quality of the product has just gotten much better [Music] [Music]", "NpNIOSxaEDw": "[Music] [Music] No whereas I'm a little dab tool crack in [Music] okay Oh tissue paper use that for Christmas and how much would you say this was sir it was 45 45 cry it looks like that Lumpy's yeah the organ essential is looking kind of oh oh [Music] alright guys that's it there it is in-game guys welcome back where you are added again we this time this is a new extract company that I've seen but it was too expensive to purchase but money was a was kind enough to let me use his to review and yeah we got the DAP rig and we got James I'm saying and I don't know if these guys want to take a dad but we're taking dad I'm taking whoa was that you don't get out [Laughter] so yes guys this is the Mendo fruits of live resin hir Skittles fuels and you already seen the intro already it's a collaboration that the guys said that the field extracted a collaboration with the scales people that's really yeah okay so like all the red boxes before they put them when they collide mosquitos [ __ ] you see that's why some of - I said give me the most tasty one please hit that one oh okay okay and it came with its own dad pole just pretty you feel me hella small and I'm not gonna use it but he had 45 at the new we went to this new dispensary called doctors choice and everyone my choice it was something new like oh yeah I like I like I said earlier in the other videos he knows actually doesn't have the 30 percent off now so it's hard to get medicine out here but tough out here in these flats I mean we went to this place they all have lab coats for some serious boy calm down we just buy some weed dog is no fine the [ __ ] is the review so what sort of people like right here oh there you go Dan that's a fatty ticket I want to see this [Music] so you've tried field extracts before right but have you tried the red one or whatever the clap I tried AG lab but not the Mentos fruits one who nash it is so i don't do as much as money as you can already tell these are appeared diamonds it's like more diamonds and sauce books just the right amount of sauce to come home the night may taste yeah without the sauce got another thing to review so hopefully stick around i actually picked up market essentials my former number one we'll see if it still stands to the sense of time you know this this is still my number one but i think rock garden beats it now but let's just see what them wrong that's another video tasty we they just taste like the week but [Music] America the who yeah most [ __ ] good why did you like that [ __ ] you wanted your own or you want my ready I take I took one dab this morning on that woke up on my way over here and that's it [ __ ] is that you better take that [ __ ] put on the side like that so he has smoked like a lot where he just barely started getting back into it so like hits me getting him for like hours that's the one hit no I guess it hits like itll plural is singular singular hit begin with one hit that's the warm boy let's go sister heart so yes you know you guys been asking me to try this and honestly it's pretty [ __ ] good $45 yeah would you pay I pay 40 he'd pay 40 the most you paint is 40 the most absolute the absolute most yeah I feel like it is a 40 so what do you think about it was a smooth really so if you said gummy worms I'd be like yeah probably then big enough anymore yeah I think more bro never a question we got another video to do we got this oh you think this is a game YouTube job we do this for the culture for the people cannot let them down oh yeah we're taking hits today boys we're taking hits market oh yeah I never seen that I thought that this was what happened or could still be we'll see because raw garden is a snack like I never seen you get it though this was a they they [ __ ] the CEO drove to my house and dropped off two of them oh god yeah and because they are from Laird only located in Southern California mostly and I said what is it organ organs tight bro if I don't have a warrant in Oregon I live up there like organs do like really cool I really like working it just rains too [ __ ] much but everybody's like really [ __ ] cool right but like here like okay so like I was trying to put this barbeque pit on the back of a truck and his hardest [ __ ] because it was by myself and I just see it was big and the truck was kind of hot so I was kind of struggling and [ __ ] and this [ __ ] roll by bro he's hella looking at me the [ __ ] am I got to beat this [ __ ] ass it was like my first day you ever seen my first day I don't think I want to beat this [ __ ] as he passes by me breath he stops he reverses oh yeah bring up there we go you see that risk this phone's health [ __ ] that phone gummy worms he said one of them dummies [ __ ] overall opinion of this wax $45 the gram he paid this is actually like wearing their topper like waxes that are generally higher price you like it or you lie so yeah I'm late bro I'm gonna take one more just cuz yeah so yeah the old extracts really really because it's like a ste like I'm in sauce I like this one better than the one Blake at I like this one a lot better thank God so they collapse people shields extra I guess that they die just know that they collide with the skittles on this one yeah that's that's what - yeah I bought skittles was the strain that's why I didn't even know skills was like a brand I didn't even I didn't need it like the skittles with the Z like I know like I thought the skittles at the Z was a string like you said I didn't know it was a brand yeah but I guess it's a brand and they made good shirts and so we're gonna end this video I'm not gonna show him take the dab just because I want to do this other thing and my camera's been overheating Bailey so trying to do try not to do long sessions but we'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "x_pLE1s1-Rk": "all right a little disclaimer before we start the video if you guys hear the fire alarms charlie ignore it like it's what I'm saying totally ignore that we changed all the smoke detectors batteries and there's still one that's going like beeping and we don't know which one and we've changed all of them so who knows okay just ignore it period hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here go ahead and smash the like button comment down below subscribe turn on those post notifications to be not quite every single time we post a new video today as you can see I do have the Eric the aircon piece that I will be heating out of and I'm finally trying some live rosin purrs you like rosin from 7-10 laughs and this is 7:10 Kim times or delicious alright here's our label gives us our THC percentage and all the info or whatever and I just noticed the way this packaging do you open it which is so cool it's like a little proposing like a there's like a ring in here I feel like I'll be proposed to right now again it says Oh juice make better oh geez okay Anna says davit low temperatures for ultimate experience okay I see you sometimes packaging this specific live rosin ranges from $80 to 105 dollars let's go ahead and open it up now this is my time so what you guys are seeing and what I'm seeing is the very first time so we're both looking at this packaging for the first time together whoa I really just open it and I can smell it whoa I look sick I've never smoked rosin before and I've never seen how rosin looks in my life look in person I mean say hello [ __ ] with diamonds from wrong garden but live rosin is like the period purest sauce and dab like you can go to rather than you know it's much purer than shadow sugar and all this so we gonna see what the real game is about today also the texture of this isn't something like I've never had before it just feels kind of like I'm looking at it slightly and it's pretty cool I can tell that's much harder and it's gonna be easier to pick up most likely you won't be falling I hope this is a good size and not too much because like I have said before I have never tried rosin I have never tried rosin and I'm barely starting to get into dabbing and all this stuff you know tears guys that was really good it was very smooth so she could sizes the size of it because I feel like that was a pretty good size for me maybe more but it's wrong Tiffani smooth not much residue I can see that there is a little bit of oil left over maybe I should we keep that Hey I think this has so far been one of the best flavors that I have tried like its energy enjoyable flavor the taste that you get once you're smelling it and exhaling it like you can really get the flavor of it Connell I want to see like the light on the lemony side probably taste good I think we need another guys who do you think and the dad were you guys having it with me hope you guys are enjoying your day wherever and whatever you guys are doing and whatever time it is I hope they they're blazing up with me another day of cosmas you know celebrating fortunately every day this one he's filming it like I said and yeah honestly the only reason why I got this one was because of the name bootylicious like that's what attracted me bootylicious that's how I usually pick up products by the names of it like or if it looks really nice the product like the weed or so or the name that it sound like like something I've never heard and it's crazy how I know this is out of a lot of topic but it's crazy how there's so many means to so many different things like bootylicious amnesia cream crack they come out with like the home just cannabis indices mind-blowing and like I always say this it's just it's more than just smoking it it's more than you're just getting tired it's a process to everything like rolling a joint there's a process to it you have to grind it up you have to roll to packing a cone you have to grind a you have to get your stuff for you have to stuff it you have to know when to stuff a because if not it'll be to lose a bong rip you know it's just a process I don't know it's enjoyable I just I enjoy it at first when I excited to dab I didn't really like it I didn't really [ __ ] with him because the whole process thing it was just like a hassle it was just like it's too much it's too much work so I'm not gonna do it and I rather just stick to something quick like a cartridge that's on the go you know I wasn't appreciating the process but now I just I really appreciate and I really like I just love having it I don't wanna put that out there I love that me now even though I'm not the biggest ever but let's go ahead and take a mother dad this is my second Dabba this is the size of it cheers guys are you rate someone to attend mm-hmm a 7/10 hell yeah hell yeah they're fired damn and I can like taste like the pureness like he's so even though it was like having me coughing it is I didn't give me like an after I know when I'm gonna take a big hit and sometimes after they hate your it all feels like very raspy I'm not feeling that like I'm just thirsty cuz I haven't drank water but the hit smooth mm-hmm I feel like in every dab you always say so smooth but by far this one has to be the smoothest I would definitely go ahead and buy this product again even if it's it ranges up to a hundred five dollars I I [ __ ] with it I [ __ ] with it this definitely convinced me you guys have been I haven't seen some comments back a few months ago I reviewed their courts and I actually like did not get the best review out of it I'm guessing I had a falsie battery or I don't know what happened but I did see a few of you mentioning that well it's like 7/10 has like the best cards or whatever like they're fire you know the fire you're like this definitely has made me want to try their products again like hurt and battery because I feel like I they could have done better but the rosin sauce definitely I would purchase again on with a heartbeat like yeah cuz this is hard to find as well and they stopped quit I wasn't even gonna end up getting this when I went to this one three whenever I went to the dispensary didn't have it and right when we were about to leave they actually stopped a permit so your likes back and we've had to get it well I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope you guys were getting high with me and I will see you guys until the next day of Christmas don't forget to

going on [ __ ] like [ __ ] subscribe very no fun going down do it", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "3Dlb9-t7naE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nook Smasher

"3UXlikSwBN4": "hey it's mad at roughout studios and welcome to our special three-part series where we're turning dry ice Keefe and to Rosen and then into e juice this is part 3 and we're going to take our rosin and use Terps to turn it into e juice now here's what you're going to need to do this video you're going to need some rosin or some wax you're going to need a mixing container heat mat or water bath you're going to need a syringe to pull up the terpenes at the end hearing a nice of turps and you're going to need some diluent optionally if you don't know what those are if you need to purchase on please check out Terps usa.com and thanks to those guys for sponsoring this video now the first step is going to be to calculate your amounts we're going to do the amount to end up with one gram so we use the terpene calculator or the mix calculator on the Terps USA website and so I'll step you through how we're going to make one gram so the first step is going to be to weigh out the wax now I'm going to dilute mine about 30% so in order to achieve that I'm going to start with about seven tenths of a gram and through the magic of editing uh nailed it first time so we're taking our seven tenths of a gram of wax and then I'm going to add in the terpenes there's different flavors that you could get of terpenes I'm using the og cush flavour because I love the og cush 'iz and terpenes are a fully natural ingredient that are derived from plants and it's going to give it the flavor and also diluted and you see I added two tenths of a gram to get to just right about nine tenths of a gram so about 20% of terpenes a little bit more than that and I'm gonna start making me sneeze and stuff so I'm keep in mind about 20% and then because the wax that I have is also a shatter when it's at a cold state I'm adding in 10% of a diluent a diluent is just a way to dilute it some to make it a little bit thinner and it's also a terpene itself or a nearly flavorless terpene all natural [Music] so the next step is to heat it up to about 150 degrees Fahrenheit you can set it on a heat mallet I did or you can put it in a little water bath if you're using glass containers just be careful not to spill it and then stir it while it's up to 150 degrees and that's going to be your best way to combine it together and then after that you're really done and once it's fully combined you're ready to use the syringe to pull the ejuice up out of the container and then to put it into your cartridges really as simple as that and there's no wait period or anything needed and once it's cooled off it's ready to go and you have some delicious really delicious tasting Aegis so now we're going to try it out with our little vape in here and I was really impressed with this this is the way to make the juices when you want up to taste like the ones you buy in this dispensary it's really great flavor so if you want to learn more about terpenes I would really recommend you checking out Terps usa.com even if you're not interested in buying them there's tons of information about terpenes and what they are how they're used and other ways you can use them other than mixing them with cannabis so be sure to visit Terps usa.com and again thanks to those guys for sponsoring this video I hope you liked this video if you did please hit the like button and visit ruffhouse

pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "gp9rDMAuogw": "this channel is strictly for viewers 18 plus I do not use or

what's up youtube dopaziola here hope you're on a dope ass day welcome back to the channel today i got three stories for you and i'll let you know right now a majority of these were not my [ __ ] fault all right i'm just gonna say that now majority of these are not my fault so today's story time topic is deals gone wrong bad drug deals shitty [ __ ] annoying [ __ ] a waste of my time whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it that's today i'm super stoked to tell you guys you guys been asking non-stop when are the new bombings coming when are they dropping so november 13th next friday friday the 13th we got red this is called elvis red we got the black version we got the clear version we also have an all clear ball with the black and we have one with the frosted so four new bongs dropping next week remember pushtrees.com another announcement that i'm super [ __ ] hyped the true og is back guys do you remember the true og when i first moved to la if you've been following me for a long time you guys remember i smoked true og for two years straight i smoked this more than i smoked the venom but i finally got some good ass weed and yes what's in the bag is coming up next week i finally got a [ __ ] pack so today guys we were smoking the classic true og okay let's hop right into the story this one makes me smile man because it reminds me of [ __ ] john do you guys remember john from my dealer story time and you guys already know that one if you haven't clicked this link right here that's the my dealer story time one of my [ __ ] favorites so knowing john getting weak from him i met this guy named jeremy jerem is one of my real good friends now i still [ __ ] talk to jeremy all the time he's he's been here in the warehouse i [ __ ] with you so guys remember this is a long [ __ ] time ago so if you hear crazy prices and [ __ ] just remember this is a long time ago me and jeremy were going to santa cruz i knew somebody in santa cruz that was selling me hella pounds of weed and i was getting [ __ ] fire and i was getting a good deal at 28. i was paying 2800 a pound and it was a good deal back then i was getting [ __ ] played but he was fronting me like 10 packs at a time jeremy was buying 10 packs he was fronting me a bunch of [ __ ] my other friend was giving me [ __ ] and i'm not saying i didn't buy packs of course i bought 10 packs and [ __ ] like that but my homie in santa cruz had way too much weight and you always say hey i know you got those four but do you want me to frustrate 10 and i was like uh yeah [ __ ] yeah i want you to front me 10. so that's the only reason i kept going up to santa cruz and he had that candy land do you guys remember that strange candy land if you follow my snapchat you know this is the thing that gave me a [ __ ] lung infection i didn't know back then i didn't know about the mold and ash and [ __ ] i wasn't paying attention i was flying through ten packs so why the [ __ ] am i gonna break down and look at each nug that wasn't me guys i wasn't thorough with my looking at my nugs making sure i'm good busting them over is there a bud rod is there this these are molds so i smoked those packs the same exact strain of candy land for about six months i'm just bringing this up real quick so you guys can be cautious at home and ever since that day that's why i only buy the truth i only get the venom i only get it from certain growers only smoke this because i'm not risking a lung infection ever again i couldn't smoke for like two solid months i still did i took bong rips to [ __ ] but it was just like ugh i couldn't breathe at all i went to the doctor i'd get breathing treatments all types of [ __ ] so that candyland is what made me a picky [ __ ] so it's me rosie germ we get in germs car we go up to santa cruz for merced we go to santa cruz to buy some packs this time i wasn't getting [ __ ] i was merely going to help germ out connecting with the guys so we can get some pound [Applause] so we go up there we're at santa cruz i think jerk gets like seven or eight pounds so the weeds packed up we put in the trunk we start taking off we're on pacheco pass like 45 minutes later right i don't advise this don't be [ __ ] stupid i'm not saying go sell weed i'm not saying smoke weed but this is what i used to do because i'm a [ __ ] dumbass i don't care if i have 30 packs in the car if i have 10 packs in the car i'm gonna smoke in the car i know it's real [ __ ] stupid i understand but i'm in california guys i'll take some jail time over some weed it wasn't a big deal back then i'm not going to prison for [ __ ] 20 packs i'm good so i did this [ __ ] for like six [ __ ] years remember that guys so there was a trip every other day so it's not like i'm going to sit there all day taking all these trips and not smoke a joint but when you're making money continuously it's just something that you do so we're on pacheco pass like i said heading back to merced we're coming down the hill you know where you go toward los banos right so if you're from the valley you know once you get into lost panels go the [ __ ] speed limit there's a cop every other block just wait there's a lot of trafficking [ __ ] going on pacheco pass i was one of them so i know no matter what even if i'm smoking a joint i'm doing the speed limit los banos do not speed in las vegas anyway there's one main road that goes through los banos we're on the road we're just going we passed the rallies we're chilling joint goes out it still smells but we're rolling the windows down we air it out so the end of los banos turns into a highway so right when you get out of town the speed limit changes higher but there's like a 60 yard gap where the speed limit is still 35 and it goes straight to 55. so if you're speeding up and the cops want to be a dick they're always waiting on either side of the road it's like a [ __ ] up speed trap but it's legal so me and jeremy just talking i don't know what's going on but we did not see the sheriff and right we passed the sheriff he does one of these so that's it that's the international sign of oh [ __ ] i'm getting pulled over [ __ ] so i look in the rearview mirror and i can see the lights go on like [ __ ] [ __ ] jeremy immediately rolls all the windows down to get any kind of smell out the car you know what i'm saying he starts pulling over as he pulls over guys as this [ __ ] my homies we just went and bought backs as we pull over remember rosie's in the backseat we're pulling off the [ __ ] freeway grass and [ __ ] tumbleweeds and [ __ ] it's lost as he pulls onto the dirt he looks at me goes yo and i'm looking at him and the face he's giving me is like sadness guilt and he looks like he's like i'm sorry he's just looking at me as he's coming to a police top goes looks at rosie looks at me i got a dui two nights ago and my license got taken away already thinking like [ __ ] dude i didn't buy any of those packs but if i take three of them and he takes three he'll both get the same i'm trying to think of all the scenarios to get him not going to jail right now my brain's like working overtime malcolm in the middle like goes into the universe and i'm like floating trying to think of [ __ ] solving problems imagine that [ __ ] like i'm trying to do all that [ __ ] in my head i'm just thinking no no i can't do anything we're [ __ ] all of that happens in like one or two seconds of my brain thinking and then i say are you [ __ ] kidding me and i look at jerry and go bro i would have just drove man i just would have drove my car if you don't have a license so i'm not gonna turn around and look at rosie because i don't want this cop pulling his gun out thinking i'm turning around doing something weird i know the [ __ ] i know the routine so i kind of look in the side mirror and look at rosie and she's looking at me like so as all these cars are passing us every time i pass a car on the highway and the guys look like [ __ ] stoners i always send a little prayer out like ah let him get through man you know there's weed in that car so the sheriff's walking up to us the other ones already behind our back bumper you know what i mean where they stand behind the right side and you see it gets scared as [ __ ] it smells i [ __ ] know it smells but it smells like burning weed it doesn't smell like fresh wheat which is good for us sheriff gets to the door germ rolls his window down i do the whole hello you know customer service hi we pull off the very like hi yo no packs in the trunk officer cop says you know i pulled you over the whole get down you were speeding blah blah license registration i'll be back cop comes back hands jeremy's stuff and says anything you want to tell me jeremy's like yeah i got a dui two nights ago he's like yeah you did get a dui two nights ago this is where the smart [ __ ] comes with chair he says i know my license is about to get revoked we all wanted to go to santa cruz last night as like a last oh my license is gonna be gone forever a going away party for his license is basically what he said and we were partying last night the cop says thanks for not lying to me i completely understand where you're coming from he says i'm going to give you a ticket for speeding but i'm not going to take your car i don't know how the legalities of that [ __ ] work but i don't know if he technically could have taken the car searched the car i don't know it definitely smelled like weed i'm not sure if the cop didn't care but he was more concerned that we weren't [ __ ] drunk he asked german two different ways have you been drinking oh how much you guys had a drink today so jeremy gets a ticket you know that lasts like 30 seconds after like the relief that first 30 seconds of knowing okay license back car's not in pound and we're leaving so jeremy turns the car on the cop says like all right be safe here's your [ __ ] thing be careful pulling out it's the highway all that [ __ ] you know the cop thing jeremy he's one of those hyped ass dudes like when he was watching football he like oh that guy is one of those screaming [ __ ] so we get about six seconds onto the highway and jericho starts let's go smack in his steering wheel like hyped up like a [ __ ] celebration that he didn't get sent to jail everything that could have happened right happened everything went our way except jerome got a ticket but we're not complaining about the ticket [ __ ] the ticket and you know what's crazy about this story i completely forgot about the story until jeremy came to the warehouse about three or four weeks ago and he brought it up while we were sitting here smoking i completely [ __ ] forgot about the story and the thing that's gonna piss you off about this whole story that pisses me off still the guy i was buying weed from that i was getting hooked up on i didn't realize who he was getting the packs from i knew the [ __ ] grower he was getting the weed from i ended up linking up with him about six months later we started talking we're like wait you know him wait i know him i get those packs candyland you grow that the guy that that was hooking me up guess how many [ __ ] points he was putting on it this man seemed real cool right i know he said he was putting one or two points on all that [ __ ] everybody says that i come to find out he was getting them for 2100 bucks and giving them to me at 28. what a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] that's the thing about this whole story that pisses me off this [ __ ] played me for eight or nine months so i was getting taxed seven hundred dollars per pound and sometimes we were going up there getting 15. of course he wanted to front me 10. he was making seven bands off me two times a week for almost nine months what a piece of [ __ ] and that's why middlemen [ __ ] suck alright guys story number two story number two is basically gonna be when i start a [ __ ] show or a movie this is gonna be a scene no matter what it's too [ __ ] wild all right story number two this one i'm gonna warn you right now it's a little confusing so i'm gonna do my best to clarify all the little routes and all the branches and all that [ __ ] just stay with me i'm not sure what year this was but it was way before way before i moved to l.a so me and rosie are in la we got a rental car and a hotel i'm pretty sure the [ __ ] hotel was in long beach somewhere by the beach i remember that she stays with some of her homies from l.a they chilled the hotel smoke do whatever they're doing i go to my homies in pomona this had to be at least eight or nine years ago guys this is so [ __ ] long ago it was long enough ago that i was still selling [ __ ] weed so it was a long [ __ ] time ago so i'm there for like four or five hours guys i'm just chilling i don't get to come to la often so i'm [ __ ] i'm making the most of it so this is where it gets kind of confusing i have a friend that does music in pittsburgh so my friend that does music hits me up and says hey my friend's flying into la can you sell him some weed or can you give him some weed i say of course man i got packs with me it's all good so music guy hits me up and asked me for that favor said of course give him my number nothing out of the ordinary right smoking weed the guy hits me up text me i'm like all right cool here's the address what did you need he wanted like two zip something like that so like an hour and a half later i get a text from some random ass number i'm assuming it's from music i'm assuming this music guy's homie that's flying in la right so i give him the address i say hey come by here's the address how much weight you need he ended up needing two zips he does [ __ ] construction or something she doesn't sell weed or nothing so i thought he was gonna be packs but it was still cool i sold him a couple zips to help him out it wasn't [ __ ] dispensaries galore and [ __ ] billboards it was a little bit harder to find [ __ ] weed especially if you're from another state and you don't have a medical card so remember i'm in pomona i'm just hanging out we're smoking the guy texts me hey i'm outside i go get him remember i don't know what he looks like i don't know anything about this guy nothing i go outside there's like five people walking by i'm like uh i just put my phone in the air and a guy from across the street just looks at me hey i'm burnt i didn't even ask him his name on the [ __ ] phone i just remember music guy if his music guy's friend oh all good come through so like i said it was just me and my homie smoking and chilling now this new dude comes in to get the weed real quick my friend said it was cool he's gonna come get the weed he's gonna hang out for a minute and then go so we're sitting there we're smoking we're just hanging out talking or asking about the construction like yo what do you do you know it's a small talk so he says something that makes me go huh he goes how do you know so-and-so so-and-so's name i'm like what name like that's not music guy's name what the [ __ ] you talking about i tell him who are you talking about he says so-and-so gave me your number to come through i go yeah music guy right he says music guy who who the [ __ ] is that i look at my friend like wait what and i go who are you who are you remember i already sold this man weed accepted his money he's in my friend's car i vouched for him assuming it was music guys [ __ ] homie so after about 45 seconds of my homie like wait who are you how did you get this number who [ __ ] sent you here you know all that [ __ ] started going through our brains i got like upset like who the [ __ ] are you and i'm mad nice i'm super nice and i got [ __ ] i got upset go who the [ __ ] are you how'd you get my number who sent you who sent you here you're not music guy's friend and remember music guy is just covering up my friend's name i can't say his name i call my homie right then in their music guy i'm like yo who were you sending to my house because oh man sorry that guy already found weed he said now he's all good so he tells me that and i look at him i go wait who the [ __ ] gave you my number who are you just flew in everything matched up the guy just flew in he just got a rental car he just got here from pittsburgh so this is why i brought up clothing guy music guy and me are very good friends clothing guy and me i've never met the [ __ ] man we just know each other through business i remember this before i did push trees before i did anything because it's before [ __ ] instagram remember that guys this is a long time ago so if you got my number and i was selling weed who the [ __ ] gave you my number he tells me who gave him my number i go who the [ __ ] is that call them right now who is that call him remember what's going through my head and my homies that my homie's a very nice guy he's gonna lock the [ __ ] up on you if you don't know who the [ __ ] you are he's a drug dealer so he's in a house with two drug dealers that he doesn't [ __ ] know he was like yeah i'll call him right now of course yeah we weren't being mean we weren't aggressively we're pushing him we're doing none of that [ __ ] but you could tell that both of us from being hella smiley and happy to who the [ __ ] sent you here you could feel the vibe in the air changed to tension it was all good and happy smoking weed and selling weed and then it turned to i might [ __ ] kill you who were you i just thought of did i just get myself sent to [ __ ] jail who would the oh my god i finally let it happen like i said i was selling a lot of pounds i came to la to sell pounds i brought a hell of a pound so i'm just trying to process like who's hating on me who said some slick [ __ ] who just set me up am i gonna get the door kicked in is this a cop remember he says the guy's name i go who the [ __ ] is that i don't know clothing guy that well i don't know him first name basis like that what the [ __ ] so he calls the guy it's clothing guy clothing guy gave this random [ __ ] my number and says call this guy in l.a he'll hook you up so clothing guy decides it's a good [ __ ] idea to give a random person i've never met i've never even met clothing guy in person he had the [ __ ] nerve to give someone my my personal number remember i know i'm over the phone through my other homies i've never met the guy so he's gonna just give my number my personal number to someone oh i lost my [ __ ] i was so [ __ ] mad on top of it all clothing guy didn't even tell me he was giving my number didn't shoot me a text and shoot me a call like yo by the way i gave someone your number can you help him out nothing he just assumed that i'm gonna answer and i did and the only reason i answered a call that i didn't have saved in my contacts was because music guys said someone was coming to la to get weed that is the only reason why i even answered the call or else this would have never happened can you guys believe this [ __ ] every little seinfeld kirby enthusiasm little thing happening to me but in like a world of yo am i going to jail like i'm looking at the doors like oh my god who is this guy i'm this is it this is it and i look at him and i go i'm sorry for getting upset this is not your fault and i explained to him what happened with music guy he's looking at me like wait what he told me that he called you and said it was all good like nah man clothing guy never even [ __ ] asked me if this was okay nothing i would have said [ __ ] no i busted into a pack for two zips because i thought it was music guy that was the only reason i even broke i had to pay you know that that's my pack i now i'm two zip short so the guy thought it was hilarious my homies sitting there like get the [ __ ] out you that really just happened like yeah that just happened the story's not even close to being over you [ __ ] ready are you ready for the more seinfeld [ __ ] so i text rosie like yo i'm gonna take off you're never gonna believe what the [ __ ] just i'm like can't wait to tell her this story like yo that very [ __ ] guy so here's where it gets from like oh what what a small world coincidence seinfeld to more of like get the [ __ ] oh now i'm pissed for you so we're all hanging out right we're hanging out smoking that fat joint the guy puts his keys in his pocket his wallet he's just talking to us he's getting his [ __ ] ready to take off right he's gonna take off and i'm just still hanging out my homie and then i'm gonna go to hotel nothing out of the ordinary he has his backpack on you know he's like doing that whole i'm gonna take off and then we stick for [ __ ] 15 minutes and still talk while he's about to leave out the door you know that whole thing like uh uh all right so we're talking the joint goes out he's like all right i want to leave i'm like all right man later he goes grabs his keys and leaves i'm there for about 45 minutes i know i said i was gonna leave in 10 minutes i'm like there for like another 45 [ __ ] minutes me and my homie are laughing our asses off on the situation that just happened even he said oh i thought that was it i thought we were getting raided right [ __ ] there i go i know my homie sells a lot more packs than i do and i thought i just brought that to him so all that shit's going into my head like [ __ ] man this is all bad so i get all my stuff i'm looking for my wallet get my wallet my phone all my stuff put my backpack on looking for my keys i'm just looking for my keys now i'm saying where the [ __ ] are my keys look at my friend like did you have my keys full i kind of need to go he's like nah bro i didn't didn't [ __ ] with your keys so after about 15 minutes of looking for my case 15 minutes let's put that into [ __ ] perspective when you're searching for something it takes like 30 seconds to go through a whole room right because you're frantic did i lock him in the car i went out to the car looked at nope looked in the gutter made them all [ __ ] tweaker pick up these keys i had a rental car that guy from pittsburgh also had a rental car he just got off the plane right if you were paying attention i said he put his wallet and his keys in his pockets and then he put his backpack on and then i said as he was leaving he grabbed his keys and left this guy got his car keys and my car keys they're both rentals they're both enterprise round keys this [ __ ] snatched my keys put him in his pocket not on purpose because he was smoking weed high not thinking about it and then when he left he grabbed his keys so he now has my only car key to the rental car that i have to get back to long beach from pomona it's now two in the morning this guy says he's a construction worker he has a job at six he's asleep i know he's asleep he had a hotel already done i start texting his phone like [ __ ] 10 times like yo yo please yo answer your phone i start calling i'm calling i'm calling i'm nonstop it's two in the morning i feel horrible i even text him a few times my bad i'm sorry for blowing your phone up i must have called this guy 15 times in a row i blew his [ __ ] up after about 15 calls i just get the uh hello who is this like half asleep all [ __ ] up and i'm like yo i'm super sorry i'm the guy that just sold you weed oh yeah what's up man uh you took my car keys bro you you have my car keys with you i can just hear like moving [ __ ] around [ __ ] clanking around i just hear like stuff moving in the background i'm like what the [ __ ] and then i hear keys and he goes oh [ __ ] this guy starts going in on the apologies remember earlier when he was held like i'm so sorry i didn't know now his apology was times 30. this [ __ ] i could feel it i could hear it in his voice the [ __ ] sincerity of how [ __ ] sorry he was and i'm like yeah dude um i don't have keys that's a rental car i have i need those keys back where are you the guy was already at his hotel in hollywood i'm having pomona am i homie it's [ __ ] two in the morning i didn't want my friend to have to drive me to pomona to eat the keys drive me back you know what i'm saying [ __ ] that [ __ ] so we planned it all out he had to go to work at six in the morning he left my keys with the concierge chick at the front of the [ __ ] hotel so i had to give the guy my name and my birthday it's this random random stranger that i thought was a cop that i sold me to i'm now giving him my full name my birthday and my driver's license number so they can give the keys to the people at the front so when i get to the hotel rosie's dying laughing it's just some seinfeld [ __ ] that happens to me it happens often she knows the type of things that happen to me are [ __ ] sitcom-worthy so after all the mix-up of that guy giving my number away then the guy accidentally takes my keys then i got an uber from long beach in the morning because i have no car i have to uber from long beach to hollywood cost me another 70 i get my key then i have to uber from there straight back to [ __ ] pomona this guy i went out of my way to sell this man some zips out of a pack that i did not want to bust into and it ended up costing me like 140 bucks in uber fees a [ __ ] headache and a long ass uber drive so guys that's the definition of a deal gone wrong okay guys we are here the third and final story i wanted to talk about this story in the first season of story time 2019 [ __ ] because i've told you before there's so many stories i can't talk about until certain people are dead or in [ __ ] jail because i can't talk about that [ __ ] i'm very nice i'm very smiley all that [ __ ] i get it's fun it's funny it's great but in the end when i was younger i still sold mass amounts of weed there's still [ __ ] out there i've met a lot of scary ass people that i can never talk about right now if you're at home and you're watching this right now and you're one of these people you're like me you know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about those movies are based off events all that shit's real [ __ ] happens every day bulls get shot people get shot at people get robbed people get murked all the time in the sweet [ __ ] so it's better just to talk about fun things that can't have any repercussions so now that you see where i'm coming from i can't just openly talk about every single thing that's ever happened to me it's not gonna happen so this story right now is one of the takes of the graves it was just the ones i tell my close homies i can't talk about this on camera i tell my friends and that's it but now that i know this thing is gone people are in jail it's over it's never coming back i can now [ __ ] talk about this i don't know if you've ever been in that situation but i don't like being in those situations where i feel like yo i can get murked right now and no one would ever know i'm here this isn't fun so the story i'm about to tell you guys is the most sophisticated weed dealer i ever met in my entire life don't even know the man's name but the security and roster and everything about this man scared me to death so this is about 2012 this is after john disappeared from my dealer story time this is after john disappeared and i met that one guy dan remember dan that blocked all the punches the [ __ ] fat drooling guy that was a monster with karate this is right after dan when i said i'm done with that i'm not gonna tell you what city i was in i'm not gonna tell you what part of the state it was in california but that's all i want to tell you so this guy i was selling packs to and buying packs from when i needed [ __ ] he would have it so some of these boxes [ __ ] like that i go to this guy boxes means hundred packs so if i need boxes i talk to that guy i'll link them together cool give me some money all right i'm out he told me about this place and i straight up told him you're a [ __ ] liar remembering something about mary you're a [ __ ] liar that's exactly what i told him like [ __ ] so i told him so i caught [ __ ] on his [ __ ] wonderland of weed [ __ ] warehouse yeah [ __ ] right about two months after he told me about this place he said hey i can bring you there i'm in good with the guy i can bring you now if you ever want to go you know me of course i say yes i'm not going to tell you what he told me yet i want to explain to you what i saw so we were like driving through like kind of a forest area so once we get to the city there's one stoplight we go me and him almost get t-boned me and him almost [ __ ] die on the way to this story so me and him almost [ __ ] die we're done screaming and having a heart attack so we're just driving so we're back on the road we're pulling up to the spot i'm looking around like wait this is the warehouse out in the open so this place was like a grocery store it was like a grocery store you ever see like men in black and [ __ ] like oh grocery store cool hit this [ __ ] cereal box and it opens to another world so he pulls this grocery store looking warehouse you know what i mean like it has glass doors on the front but it's all [ __ ] blacked out it's like the size of a grocery store but literally on a main road in this town it's a smaller town yes i get that but it was in the middle of town so i know this guy pretty well i sell him packs he sells meat packs the whole boxes thing i trust him but when i pull up here i'm thinking okay i don't got a bunch of money on me he knows i don't got a bunch of money on me he's not gonna [ __ ] rob or shoot me or nothing crazy on that note this is out so we get out of the car and you can't go through the front the front like i said it's blacked out the second we get out of the car a side door opens on the side of the building right where we're parked at and i don't know how tall he was but i'm gonna say like six six six eight this black dude i mean he looked straight [ __ ] terry crews he was so big he had an armored vest on he had a [ __ ] headband on with the hat on like what the [ __ ] a headband and a hat this guy means [ __ ] business he had a gun on his hip he had no [ __ ] markings on his [ __ ] but on his back it just said something something security i don't remember the words but it said something something security on his back of his vest so i'm just looking at this gi joe dude big [ __ ] what's your name that's what he says what's your name remember my friend is speaking doing all the talking we're right outside of his car he's been there before the guy's still asking him what's your name and he's been there many [ __ ] times walks us into this remember the side door of this big warehouse grocery store he walks us into a side regular door but it's a metal door like a security door he walks us in we walk in and it is so nice bright white lights i walk in and it's just one cube like a men in black you know when they walk into the first part just like that guys just like that [ __ ] all-white room high-ass ceiling because it's like a [ __ ] warehouse that's it just a big room with one table in it there's one table where you leave your key your phone and anything in your pocket you leave it right on the table so i'm walking in like yo my homie is not bullshitting me this is about to be cool i have a feeling this is gonna be sick it's like a [ __ ] 30-foot room for just your stuff then must be baller behind those doors you put our stuff down he opens the door right to the left of the table he opens the door and it's another white hallway but way way smaller like skinnier not a room a [ __ ] hallway every six feet is a [ __ ] door all the doors are closed all of them there's no signs on the doors nothing there's just [ __ ] door knobs with locks so the security guard's walking behind us me and my friend are walking he looks like he has no care in the world i'm excited but i'm still nervous as [ __ ] this man's behind me so we're coming up to where the hallway bends and right there the last door on the right is open i'm not gonna bend my neck i'm not gonna look if i can do this that's all i'm gonna look at i'm not gonna look at anything else that's it so we're walking up and we're about to take the ride on the hallway like i said and i look and as i look i just see a bunch of like big plastic drums there's big white drums with black lids on top and there's a bunch of yellow ones with black lids also but a bunch of them right in the walkway there was like four or five drums whether there's tools in there clothes weed i'm hoping it's weed opens on bodies you take the right and there's a [ __ ] open door and it looks like a little waiting room there's little chairs and couches and we go in there and he just tells us way right here he'll be with you in a minute what show do you think's on the tv at the scary drug dealer spot leave it in the comments we'll show i'll wait jerry springer jerry springer was on the tv the little baby tv super nice warehouse with like a [ __ ] seven-inch tv it was trash [Applause] so i walk into this office this kind of cluttered ass office i'm going to be honest the first thing i've noticed is there's [ __ ] everywhere there's [ __ ] piles of papers there's a bunch of [ __ ] there's bongs it's like a [ __ ] storage closet and a [ __ ] college dorm room dude it did not look organized there's a [ __ ] little little tiny like five foot one little bald white dude super small guy he's probably 50 60 very tiny dude i'm like oh [ __ ] this is the guy so i walk in i walk in here's all the stuff to the right of me as a wall straight as a wall left me as wall so it's like a [ __ ] rectangle office at the very end it's his desk there's a [ __ ] huge tv i mean a massive tv on the wall but there's a [ __ ] six inch tv in his waiting room and then he's sitting there little dude smoking a sick i could just see imagine this the tv's like behind him to the side it's kind of highlighting the cigarette smoke i walk in like whoa this is what being a grown-up drug dealer's like this is scary remember i was really young when this happened so i've never seen anything but my homies garages and grow rooms and santa cruz [ __ ] like that i've never been to some sophisticated ass place with a security guard with a gun it was scary i walk in me and my homie sit down boom there's this desk he has a computer an old school computer shocked for this big building he has some trash computer this brick of a [ __ ] computer right here here's him me my homie that's it he doesn't introduce himself he's a [ __ ] he does like he has no sense of humor what so [ __ ] ever i go to like shake his hand he just says oh hello then one of those like uh-huh right off the bat i'm like oh god i don't like you already so he looks at me go so what do you want to get and i say what do you have it'd be a lot easier if you tell me what you want to get do you have any girl scout cookies he looks at me like is this your first [ __ ] time selling weed he gives me like are you stupid that's the look he gives me he says i

he yells out a name yells it out some dude walks in with a clipboard sits down right next to him in the chair he sits down with a clipboard looks at the guy looks at me oh hi nice to meet you and the old man starts just going away at the computer all right i got this c6 [ __ ] you start saying numbers c4 5 15. it's all that's beautiful this guy is just writing all these numbers down and he's saying i am like wait what is happening i look at my friend my friends just like that so i'm sitting there i'm anticipating like the craziest [ __ ] like what is happening why is he saying these battleship numbers what's going on the old white man gets off the computer looks to me and goes what else do you want to see and back then skywalker was the big one ago you got any skywalker or mars og that was a big height back then so he looks at me all dumb again he goes what kind of oh geez man i got 1500 oh geez what do you want and he said 1500 ogs [ __ ] you got 1500 strains or 1500 pounds he starts typing his computer and goes i got n's i got debs and i got tops i tell can i see the tops of the mars and the skywalker he starts clicking his computer tells the guy the numbers so now i realize oh you're telling him what room and what shelf how many rooms are in this [ __ ] warehouse remember he still smokes a cig he puts it out he tells the guy the last number the guy gets up leaves the room that man goes like this in his chair looks at us goes uh i just got back from new york this morning he goes yeah i've i've been there for two weeks i've just i've just been doing drugs now i'm like got my attention like oh you're cool as [ __ ] you're hungover that's why you're being so short you're hungover and he literally puts his head down he's like i'm just so [ __ ] hungover guys i just got off a plane right now i'm sorry baller man what a balling old man his business can just run without him there it's so [ __ ] sick five minutes in this guy's telling us about his new york trip and all the crazy [ __ ] he does i'm just sitting there like oh i love you now you're [ __ ] cool now 10 minutes in i'm starting to look at the door like where's the weed man where the [ __ ] the weed at and i hear a cart like a shopping cart like yo what is happening the dude with the clipboard comes into the room with an industrial-sized like shopping cart a big you know this big like a mail carrier once the huge open ones one of those guys full of packs i mean full full to the brim must have 30 40 [ __ ] packs in there so the old man goes all right pay attention let's do this this guy was just talking about how [ __ ] up he is and all that [ __ ] and the second the [ __ ] came in second the business came back he like stopped back into it sparked a [ __ ] cigarette and started going all right this is what we're gonna do guys he starts bringing the pounds out the skywalkers and the mars there's like six different [ __ ] variations of each in each price range that's why there's like 30 or 40 pounds i asked for two strains there was three or four different [ __ ] variations in each strain and like six packs behind them so each pound the guy with a notebook handed to the old white man the old white man looked at it said the number said the number on the bag and then this is how he did it he goes all right cool i got a box i got a box and a half of these and that's when i realized these guys aren't [ __ ] around that warehouse was full of weed completely full to the brim of weed he said i got boxes that means in that strain of that price range this fool had 150 a box is 100 pounds a box and a half he had 150 pounds of just that one and there's 40 pounds so he starts bringing out the packs typing the number in looking at me going all right i got [ __ ] 75 of these um this this this range if you get more than 50 i'd give you this this that i'm like whoa whoa whoa 50 no no no i'm not trying to get that much he goes what are you trying to get man i'm just shopping for my homie he probably wants like 10. he does this and i'm like oh man what did you bring me to am i supposed to buy a hundred pounds here so internally i start getting hot like oh my god how much money do they think i have he's just looking at me he looks at my friend and says i got another meeting after this man what are you guys trying to spend right in front of me he says it to my friend like i'm not even there like he brushed me off so [ __ ] fast and i'm just sitting there like well sorry sir like a little kid on my bad that's how i feel i feel this [ __ ] big like i'm sorry i'm poor i guess [ __ ] he starts doing the numbers or ways all right man how much do you got to spend what do you want to spend dude whole attitude changed up as soon as he found out i wasn't spending [ __ ] a hundred thousand dollars so i finally decided on the 10 packs that i want pick them all out i tell them hey i'll be back in about 25 minutes i can go get the money come back he looked at me like when you're at a store and somebody tries to help you with something you go oh never mind i'll buy it later and they go yeah right we walk out well no we don't walk out we get escorted out by terry crews terry crews escorts us out we get to our [ __ ] car door closes behind us get in the car go get the money i don't even tell my homie what happens i just tell them to [ __ ] i just tell them how much the prices are i tell them everything i get the [ __ ] money go back buy the pounds i drive to my friend's house that gave me the money i show them the packs the [ __ ] do you think happened four of them he didn't want didn't like i had to buy him in the end in the end of all that i was just trying to help somebody and i got stuck with four pounds i didn't want i got rid of them of course i got rid of them but four pounds i didn't want i had to pay somebody a thousand dollars out of that money i had to lose a thousand dollars out of the two thousand dollars i was making and in the end yes i made all my money back i didn't [ __ ] lose money but that is a deal gone wrong i literally went to help somebody with a weed deal and got [ __ ] played and real quick i know it's not a whole story but real quick about that guy one of the rare times this old man was being pretty cool to me i'm sitting there looking through all the packs i was looking for depths i was going through a hell of different [ __ ] light dips like 1400 range to 1800 range it took [ __ ] hours anyway we're talking smoking a [ __ ] cigarette again he goes wants something cool he changes the tv channel to his security system his security system [ __ ] on any dispensary i've ever seen now this guy must have had a hundred different cameras in that building and remember i told you i said i saw those drums i'm like what's in there i saw rooms i mean rooms like costco shelves pounds just turkey bags all perfectly lined up and big drums next to them big drums big big big open tables like this open tables just shatter stacked on the tables i mean [ __ ] slaps oils pants this that they had so much it was a wonderland it was just like he described every room was like a different strain every room has a different number the 1400 ogs from this guy are in this room the 1600 ogs are in the room next to it okay across the cookies oh okay across the gdp coolest thing the coolest [ __ ] thing i had ever seen in my whole life he's clicking it and it's going to another page with hell with different [ __ ] cameras going to another page of hell with different cameras on this big tv it was like watching a movie and seeing like the inner workings of like a like a beehive or some [ __ ] you could see all of this [ __ ] working and this old man just sitting there [Music] i'm going to new york i asked him what are those drums right there what are those big barrels i always wondered he said when people buy metric tons tons when people buy metric tons of outdoor we put them in those barrels and that's what they pick them up in i'm over here breaking down four to five pounds and thinking i'm [ __ ] awesome every couple days and these guys are literally moving metric tons a week but like i said the reason i get to talk about this now is because my homie talked to him those people were in jail those people are gone they're done it's over the rain is gone but like i said selling weeds not worth it that was scary that could have gone wrong if i said something stupid that security guard could have done anything he wanted he could have shot me could have beat the [ __ ] out they could have kept me there could do anything they want some jessie pinkman [ __ ] could happen to me and nobody would have ever known like i always said it's not worth it don't sell weed this is not a [ __ ] advertisement like cool oh he's so weird he's fine no i'm lucky i'm lucky as [ __ ] [ __ ] didn't happen to me it's not worth going to prison over some weed so in the end he was just the best middleman i ever met

ashes no headaches no tunnel vision and doesn't result in the munchies the hot crease up and leaves the smoker to feel quite euphoric relaxed and calm as at peace one odd attribute from this trend is

notification bill so you don't miss any of these cool last video it's more I'm gonna go ahead no sorry I'll try to get into this video I haven't made videos in a couple days you guys because I haven't had any exotics you guys already know halfway if I got regular weed I try to put the exotics up first and right now we're not done with these these exotic so this is one of the best best package means I've seen the only problem that I don't like is when the government gets involved supporting I don't like when the government gets involved then we start working with population control we start trying to figure out how to alter the weed to make it do different [ __ ] and say just leave the weed the [ __ ] alone the we do they got here at home in Florida this has got to be government [ __ ] because like I've told you always I've never in life tasted a weed that has no taste no smell when you pull it out [ __ ] smell it there's no smell absolutely no smell at all when you smoke you mean before like smokes going in there's no taste no flavor no nothing but we got some taste and flavor right here you guys and we don't get right in it let go not know bubbling please some more water y'all excuse me for a second oh sorry meat are weightless I need to have some water in this puppy I need my bubble the bubble you know then cool nice bubbly but it's okay so I was I was so preoccupied with it not bubbling properly completely missed the flavor of it so maybe I should trying to hook up a nebulizer to go into my bowl so I have I'm taking a hit I'm getting fresh air off my beautiful I want to say it's a platinum but I taste platinum and og mix together it's funny that's a funny flavor enough I don't recognize it so it's gonna be kind of hard to critique a flavor that you've never had before after can't even bring up a flavor in my memory breakup in my memory bank and what is compared to wow this is completely flavor I definitely taste on platinum or a og we'll go with an OG so it tastes like an OG I don't feel any buzz yet sorry but the external coughing right now guys but this morning I woke up which was about 10 minutes ago with the asthma attack I was having an asthma attack and I'm still kind of having a slight problem breathing it's not Co VD COPD it's not um it's not the virus I don't even want to think of the name of the bar he doesn't [ __ ] the Budweiser bar y'all told me let's get back miss y'all man show you the couch all the new subscribers welcome to the family appreciate you guys leave as many comments as you want talk about every we did you like um like comment and share go ahead and share some of the videos if you like though you don't let everybody else see see the critiquing of this excellent it's most excellent exotic budge alright woo okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best on the flavor critique of this turtle pie um I think we're gonna give this a it's an odd taste so it's kind of hard to number this so I'm gonna have to give it a 6 because the flavor is a little above average but it's so unknown in my memory base and I had nothing to compare it to so I can't compare to LA Confidential when it may not be at that level flavor-wise like I told you guys no but for me smoking cigarettes were I think I smoked 443 some some odd years yes smokes for like 40 years 41 years cigarettes hit home that stuff just messed up my taste buds hey if you guys can stop smoking please stop smoking cigarettes they've been telling us since they've been making signals that the [ __ ] kills you and not only is it killing you from smoking it is killing me twice as fast imagine that so people smoke around me then I feel like they have no respect for my life if they have no respect for their life that's fine we can work on that but if you have no respect for my life then I can't [ __ ] with you no I'm saying cuz you telling me you don't give a [ __ ] we're sitting in the car and you're gonna light a cigarette you tell them you don't give a [ __ ] about my life so if you have a chance to stop smoking savings and the weird part is everybody that smoked cigarettes all the people that I know that smoke cigarettes said damn I wish I could quit stop smoking and put the shit's down the way to quit is this up stop smoking the normal times that you smoke when you if you smoke in the morning as soon as you wake up don't smoke wait 1 or 2 hours if you smoke after you eat don't smoke right after you smoke wait till like 2 3 4 hours wait to your foods completely digested before you smoke if you smoke before you go to bed or smoke while you're taking a [ __ ] wait a couple hours after you do that do these these things and eventually that happen will be broken of you smoking at these times and you can start picking them up one by one ok well [ __ ] after I eat I'll just skip that cigarette for the next two hours you know and then if I'm gonna take a [ __ ] I'll just bring my phone in here and watch a movie or something I got a smoke smokes not good for you guys there's a lot of things not good for you and I cut out a lot of things I already told you guys before I'm complete vegetarian I try not to eat sugar although I have a problem with that I have no dairy I don't eat eggs I don't drink milk I don't drink soda I don't drink tea I drink coffee none of that [ __ ] I don't eat white bread none of that no meat no meat at all told you before I might [ __ ] with some shrimp here and there but I didn't even had that and so long let's get back in there all so I have more storage so you guys stay tuned tomorrow for the tomorrow's video as well and the day after that isn't it dad Glen yeah we're gonna do a little marathon real quick we go around with it so uh before we get you guys staying here too long let's do a critique okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best on the high of this turtle turtle turtle pie I really I think this is turtle pie but like I said it's from the turtle Pot company anyway we're gonna critique it is that and uh behind this is a really interesting high it seems like it's complex now let me explain usually when you get high in the eaters high nexium go I'm high or or I'm partially higher on somewhat high this is complex high it's like I'm high but I'm not but then again if you listen you are but I'm not yes I am it's one of those I'm high but it's so mellow a bahai well it's not mellow it's an intense high but I it's hard to explain it's an under control high go figure so on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the high of this turtle pie we're gonna give this a seven seven is the first thing that popped in my mind although it should have been the same as the flavor which was a high six I think then we will move this down to a six a high six of that so there goes the critique of the flavor or internal pie from a scale from one to ten ten being the best one being the worst we gave this a six and on a scale for the high of this particular cannabis turtle pie on one being the worst ten being the best we gave this also a high six so this is a balanced but here six being its best else mouthful wouldn't tell you well let's go ahead and hit it again it's not a giggly high but it's a it's a cool lot I don't feel like wanna sleep did he do it did he do it ladies and gentlemen no call okay got to give y'all one for the road anyway home so I think you guys from stopping by I love when you guys come hang out because we always have so much to talk about we hang out appreciate you all love your life man y'all be blessed have an awesome day matter of fact make this day legendary y'all your dorm will say make it the [ __ ] up out of here and stay babe", "O7p5tLewKEc": "good morning everybody welcome back this Clayton here hits September 13th and I am out here with the chickens and they're enjoying some cannabis this morning which means we're gonna have some good eggs around here you know I always appreciate cannabis fed eggs the same time that means never a good sign for the outdoor crop huh never good side when the animals are eating the weed so let's go back there and take a look at him [Music] so yeah this plant you don't see here was the Klan or Al and what happened is actually there was a couple Huskies throughout front of my property the other day they were lick attacking me and me and sweetest nicest dogs you know running out in the road didn't wanna get hit or hurt and long story short put my dogs away let them come back here until I could find their owner well as that wandering around oh they did their thing that dogs normally do didn't think about it but they killed two of my chickens and in the process broke my plant here and it fell over the roots are ripped up enough where I couldn't do anything to really save it tried to stake it and rope it and support it but didn't work and so you know he I lost my plants also to lost to chickens and one rabbit that day made for other crappy mornings but you know my fault for you know letting them in here not really thinking about you know the nature of those dogs but anyway on to more positive stuff no more clowning around unfortunately you know sad Wow I'll get it again I love really was anxious to try that strain but the good note forbidden fruit forbidden fruit here again Kenji crossed with cherry pie a really nice sativa crust in indica growing very nicely and beside note and or squirrel so to speak these leaves back here are grape leaves neighbors over there has some really nice grapes but all it's the same time big ol leaves powdery mildew so I am starting to see a few small spots on the plants already and if you're here with me an organ or the northwest you know we've had a lot of rain heavy heavy rain last few days and so you get out here and start treating them and again thanks to you know the YouTube community I really appreciate everyone you know sharing information that's all I try and do is share I learned about the milk spray solution and I'm gonna be doing about you know a 40% milk 60% water solution which I believe comes to right about six cups of milk to the gallon and you know spring the plants of those I do like to use a sulfur but not when they're this far along the flower I don't like you know enjoying my medicine and tasting fireworks at the same time but anyway yeah forbidden fruit she's doing good getting big there again right there you can see a little spot that's a little bit of powdery mildew starting to show up right there so yeah again I get out here and start being religious about taking care of those things so yeah forbidden fruit you know doing good pretty far along where she was a little bit further but grateful for how she's doing there and my little squatty one here perfectly named blueberry muffin blueberry muffin smells amazing already and this one is definitely more photoperiod sensitive you know further long buds are a little bit bigger already already repeting out it'll be nice this one will definitely finish first and you give it the kind of stagger that way can you know give this one worked on what other ones are finishing strimmin from october always a chore but uh you know labor of love but anyway and again to have two layers of trellis here and this is the blueberry muffin a short little squatty lady thinned out underneath there okay see same thing as a forbidden fruit there I was like to thin out the inside I do leave a little bit more than most people to but the same time I do feed a lot of my animals the undercarriage and I do like to do you know cold press the leaves myself too but anyway another side note squirrel here started working at the aquaponics garden just to play with did a lot of different things and they're growing and I got the fish down below there but did have some you know squash type vegetables in there or you know are big leaves and uh there had powdery mildew on them so my god darn it you know kind of given my plants the worst worst case scenario is trying to hit him from both sides so anyway yeah I will be out here spraying these and taking care of it later and our last little plant that dosey doe didn't get really big here in the corner and the same time to when those dogs were chasing chickens around some of these branches got broken off down in there and one got a little wonky so ended up being my funky bonsai but still it's gonna finish out some nice nice colas here you know everything should fill in nicely and grow together and be nice a nice little harvest good amount of medicine and at this point - I have had enough amendments in the soil I've been given them you know a worm casting tea with a little bit of molasses as I talked about in another video there and I'll probably just start young straight water here soon your limbs finish out anyway there's just look around the garden today good bad another grateful hock for how it's all going though you know glad to have the meds finishing out grateful to be able to do it so anyway that's just look I'll quit running my mouth and just wish you all the best happy growing everybody bless it be", "yvSUNyMI9JU": "oh what's up guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having a little day don't forget to smash that like button and

collapsed another time actually twice because it wasn't planned the second time and he was very welcoming and not only to myself but i brought my wife along and he was interacting with her which i think that just shows a lot in a person he was like she was behind the scenes but he was still managing to interact with her and that's pretty dope i know he's always trying to um build other smaller youtubers and help them grow with their channel and i think that that also shows a lot in a person you know especially that has more success than others trying to like share their success like does

smells amazing i've heard really good things about it but i have never personally tried it myself yeah i'm excited i haven't tried it either but yeah i'm basically like city exclusive [ __ ] is pretty good i had like darwin farms from there one time uh the boston gelato probably like my one of my favorite we in the world like super good i remember there was one that you had talked about it was like elephant something oh elephant growth oh gee yeah that's something that wasn't there that's a dope gas ass og yo some of the cleanest og i've had but it's like always limited drop so you kind of get

thumb competitors yeah you see ain't no jokes around here man chokes up there's water coming in that's two that's three easy work legendary bro oh my god bro let's go i'm the double barrel though oh", "171M_Az6dHQ": "and go hey there welcome back to carpenter's apprentice today we have something really cool to share with you guys my local head shop has been nice enough to invite me in to review some of their products and so we have something really cool a local product or not a local product but a small business that's producing some stuff for the culture come on and take a look so right now here what we have is the dime bag company that was started by two guys roughly ten years ago and what they wanted was high quality storage containment systems that they could use to transport their stuff that's sensitive and so what they did was they went ahead and created these dime and nickel bag products their first iteration of the bag was 100% hemp on the outside with an inner velvet lining but that didn't work out so well because they got a bunch of residue and whatnot in it so then they went to a second iteration and in that one what they used was hemp on the outside and cotton on the inside the unfortunate thing about this was it decomposed too quickly so they went again and they went to the drawing board and they said okay let's forget everything that we already have and let's try and come up with something that's even more durable than any product we have on the market now and they took a polyester blend with hemp and they put those two things together to create something called hipster and that is their current iteration of this but they went a little further they took a first that fourth iteration of all this including everything that I've mentioned before but this time they added a smell proof pouch in every single case the fifth thing that they did was they added a secret compartment in some of their bags I was not able to find it in these unfortunately I tried my hardest so why don't we come and take a look at the bag so you can take a look at the quality you come close it one of the things that turned me off about initially was that this big logos there and it's kind of like a dead giveaway that what the hell you're doing but they thought of that check this out you could take it off so now it's you know you really wouldn't know what was in there and then if you take a look all around the bag you have different storage pouches and this is just one model this one here looks to me to be more for a water-pipe shape just like it but check out the inside the linings are really cool it feels so soft and then you have all these cool little compartments you can put whatever you want in there I flipped it all the way out just see what was up because you know it's these bags you get all this stuff in it you can never get things out of the crevices but this one check this out all the way through nothing staying in there so I like that about this company also I like it whenever people just try to contribute to the culture because they are already a part of it that feels better later on in this episode I'm going to talk about big corporates though and what role they play in the culture so I really appreciate the Dimebag company I tried to find criticism guys because I don't think that an accurate review is done unless you have both the pros and the cons but the problem was every time that I tried to find a con the company had to re reached out to the individual to try to fix it this is a fabulous company if you're gonna buy from somebody I would highly recommend them", "-UsSkK6Hg04": "[Music] while compatible are going to look about EMV cars and today we have a 2005 Hummer h2 equation so this is a maroon color beyond the Hummer h2 version has the six liter v8 on these massive 35 of chrome wheels she's quite large word of advice don't get hit by one because uh this right here solid solid steel he has this brush guard

you can do it ever it's got plenty of room that's right here guys we have the vortex six liter v8 the thing is a beast of a motor in this piece of a vehicle they gigantic Hummer with a gigantic motor alright guys now the interior of the 2005 Hummer now this is actually a very modern interior for 2005 we have a lot of very modern equipment on here that you wouldn't expect to see we have the heated seats over here and then we actually have this really cool function you know if everybody in the car is just dying of heat exhaustion just throw every window down at once what's isn't that just a great future and then you know if you just want to bottom all back up you can't then we have on the steering wheel got your volume controls your source controls you have your information over here for your guests your range what you're going to need it is this thing sucks it down you got your information right here little bag button over here we have our life the dimming then you have your windshield wipers you know cruise control all that good stuff to get all your basic window and mirror controls over here we actually have Bose audio in here as well which is very cool for 2005 we have our four wheel drive settings right here tracks control you're hauling trailers and then it actually also has the lotuses here like the Yukon does where it will adjust accordingly if you have more stuff in the back it will lower the front so you have a smoother ride right here we have our old-school 2005 radio with the basic volume FM AM radio CD player good old radio right there then we have our AC which is pretty cold for 2005 air actually I don't know if that therefore serviced or not but so it's pretty cold surprisingly cam you know basic controls down here we got the old-school on start for all those emergency needs you have on the side of the road so then we have this the shifter right here which reminds me a lot of a thruster on an airplane you know because that's exactly what this is a giant flying test truck that's couple thousand pounds of our sunroof on our 2005 Humber h2 which is pretty basic and then you know you can just tuck around away and then here in our middle console area we have this nice giant space here for any of your needs put some change you know story napkins you know purse wallet so then we have our nice leather seats here with the wool fold-down armrest for when you're driving so even more comfortable I was just like 2005 I'm still slightly down to five indeed but you know if you ever want to feel like you're in the military this is how you do it right here because I promise you you're not getting hurting this thing in any way shape or form and then back there in the back seat we have plenty of room for our camera equipment and for people indeed actually got lots of leg room lots of head space back there you got your little fold down console there for cupholders and this is all leather from 2005 there you go all original we got the a/c controls back here as well problem can't say that but pretty cool for 2005 you know you wouldn't expect to see that alot in certain vehicles but hey Hummer all right in then we're going to go up on a little drive here in the Hummer on 35 you know cuz why not so this here is a quite quite large vehicle here I feel like I am driving through Afghanistan currently about how hot it is here only feels like 115 or something like that but it's alright because we are semi cold in here now like I'm up to a engage thrust Airport this thing so sure is cool though minja commerce you know it's just any plenty of power to move this sucker I hope Hummer can take bounce as well as I thought it would but hey you leave this  in the desert man sort of had the Mustang look you gotta be yourself oh yeah don't even try speed bumps and then decide but this is off-road vehicle this is an off-road vehicle but now with the speedy nation exhaust until you want yeah it makes it a lot more better more better a lot more better I'm going to college us for just a song corrupt highway speed this thing is not passive look for a first-ball metal and steel for like ten gallon gallons oh yeah nothing downtown and five tons over here metal honey I'm rearing the hell out of the launcher and they never know it'll all here they die yes we look at the size difference between this thing and I feel like I mean we got them like tank I guess I looked at your representation I can think of at this point so we're going to give a huge shout out to Wyatt Johnson for giving us this tank of a vehicle here the Humber a super 2000 plus we hope you liked this review like I was describing we will see you guys later [Music]", "13mXgmByViQ": "[Music] yeah yeah you know we had to roll the number hello welcome

right now I'm about to enjoy myself because I'm gonna smoke an amazing strain review it rate it tell you what I think of it and just talk [ __ ] about it and probably not about it here's the deal the training that I am reviewing today got a few policy of waiting to be reviewed but I call number which ones which no I will not say the strain yet identify these strains definitely not that one it's deadly not nasty it's one the orange ones which [Music] yeah this is orange creamsicle this is the only confidential straightaway yep if you know that one not reviewing that today definitely push and ha ha ha this is it this is it this is what remains under setup here definitely confirm that was a bit too fresh nanowires but fresh it was been lifting the pot for ages hold on no yep yep yep oh don't here we go here we go today on weed view more editions with myself Rizla we are reviewing sheriff excel effects an effect fruity pebbles oh gee fruity pebbles what can we tell you about this swell I wish I could tell you thing about this haven't checked the phone yet for the information it's doing a research hold on my research do your research hi welcome back to strain Kanner's and IM Rizla and we are reviewing Fruity Pebbles OG AKA from you pebbles OG hi welcome back again to strain caters I am Rizla and we are reviewing FP o G which is fruity pebbles Oh G look this is my knowledge I am talking from the heart and from the brain by alien genetics fruity pebbles sweet high fruit okay guys I'm reading it from leafy okay I really believe me but yeah this does repo need me you don't need me don't need this don't need this all this for tips and learn stuff guys you can just go in so neatly that's what I'm doing right now I just read you what Leafly says in fact it's just and now I really - yeah but alien genetic sit was limited time offering from the breeder this sweet hybrid takes you next from a green ribbon grind any purple and tie a tie hoe alien to create a tropical berry flavor reminiscent of cereal who needs the review named sunny you've learn it all now a cereal column said that word so real oh so real was that a horse a little of the surreal you can read it without would think why I listen to me never listen to me your effects won't give you happy when you're stressed I'll help you catch some sleep when facing insomnia sit back relax and pour yourself a bowl of Fruity Pebbles oh gee well why ain't a bowl worth no way I've got a balls worth I did have quite a bit but not now no no no no no not now now I only have this amount here I wanted to review a long time ago guys well it was a big fat bar but yeah I have shaped bits and pieces off that's one of the reasons what I have identified the bud not all from the smells and the looks of it but also I can see this was the the fruit helpers right bouldery nug and when you ripped it off it stayed in its bulky form where when I was ripping off a lot of the other buds the the the main bud would tear quite a bit and you could see it break-ins in its various other bits of pieces this here is just almost solid so we are reviewing fruity pebbles by taking genetics there you go guys look at that the first time a first time obviously you just seen what come through but yeah we are reviewing this and I'm gonna break it out of ten but what are we covering what are the four things to cover one of them isn't sound oh no no no no no one of them is the sight one of them is the smell one was the taste and of course not important the most fun of all is the effects breaking out the tin as I said our walking cards if this is the first time you watched we've you then I'm gonna say it already I should have said aces go but I think what I don't know why I make the sound bench move my mouth I could just add all the sound effects on in fact I do add the sound effects on afterwards psych I don't know there you go give me a thumbs up if you like this video we are six nine nine subscribers right now as the recording has happened and it's stuck on $6.99 I'm thinking well any second that song is gonna get to 700 someone will be the 700 per subscriber to our channel but it just hasn't happened yet so please hopefully by the time this comes out it would be more than 700 but still we want to get to a thousand and then we can do that is if you get the sub bun and hey you there you might as well go all out and hit the notification but as well see that mr. thing from the shrink anus small talk over he says what can we say about this strain well let's find out what I can say about this trailer when it when it came to me was a huge massive boulders massive massive boulders tight but there is a better give to it and I think that's pretty because it's been in the pocket so long no moving more to find it up a little bit I'm gonna see what it looks like in the grinder I will provide you with the picture the video that I took ages ago now so [Music] dr. dental Shh yes see me now they see me for that but he's probably right that any doctor dense yeah I can't do that he told me I'm not gonna nice to do that I really will do it Delia you're [ __ ] with a bit more and you're gonna be [ __ ] found you're gonna be found then you're gonna be gone you pick up thought that there's really a 10 more likes until that video has been activated part - yes don't talk about toe contour part 1 episode 1 doctor then at the surgery episode we are 10 likes away just 10 thumbs up on that video until I put part 2 1 now I was hoping it was gonna be maybe a few weeks and then I'll get the 50 but yeah always being it's overconfident with the powers of strength cleaners so it's taking a bit longer and then I'd hope so help yourself just like the video yes of Fruity Pebbles information popping up cuz I couldn't remember what I just read on the [ __ ] phone so from us wearing but we're talking about cannabis swearing should be the least of the worries right now YouTube spires are you on me I hate the kind of mints I hate Lee kind of ass and I'm always telling my viewers don't smoke enemies though right kids in that right kids I'm always telling you don't don't touch this evil herb slightly gone spies have gone there's actually a plane flying past my my house right now I'm assuming that was the YouTube spice chicken on me I don't know why they use a plane to check on me never you see much I wish it was bigger now it was so big guys we was all about the site on this one it was a lot bigger sasori's bit puny now on this what you can see here is dark but there is loads and loads and loads of Brown little hair thingies Pistons they call me look stick you said they caught covered in them and it's not like they're sticking up and all pointy they're actually wrap around the bad completely wrapped round the bud almost like a spiderweb well crack open the Holly is those snap back to their pickup winter its notion that factor it's all no it's not so it's really wet already look in the pot seal off place it yeah I'm gonna air my buds out nice dry I was dry there we go we had bugs out there you can't receive them but for the jars are now ripened and the freshness is coming up hmm so grind this up in the area sorry you wanna let's see if we can get away with spliff because it seemed really lovely lovely don't so I'm gonna tip it too far away pull it out I'll just did that oops waist up whatnot I'll come back for that next week when I'm hanging for us booth I can't really see much guys but it's dark he knows about weeds recently black dogs dark no no no this is no in years but is the black dog obviously copy and it's nowhere near as doggies the black dog over so good I mean the best the best thing about this is when when you saw it is the bulkiness of the buds and just the just very hanky stocky bud now doesn't mean that it's always good we know sometimes try forget the where is it cooler then things call them then RPGs are they what they called not role-playing games are they they called st. cows PTR's no no no no you know I'm talking about them things they can make it really stocky so maybe it's bit that going on there maybe ed good buds not as strong wrist point I love finger tall Fruity Pebbles seen a lot better-looking buds I've got a lot better looking but some of the here I'm looking and that a lot better than this but the bulkiness was good for it that's really gonna help it out with the score again you might think I'm being generous but you you should have seen the bulkiness of it and it wasn't looking a lot better it was now this is on the shovel leftovers I'm gonna give it a seven and a half for the sights the smelling fruity pebbles what are we expecting from three pebbles what are we gain fruitiness yeah we do that's not all again like a perfume ish now I've grind a deeper cause I think they're very performia this is not that kind of perfume sort of smell these berries in there when I say lime as well but maybe just like some kind of citrus in in the taste in the smell now I'm picking up hmm I mean it smells lovely live and smell it for a long long time so I'm gonna start putting something out yep you wanted to see mystical at last I'll I've got some decent reason now we're not these aren't these some buttons the schools got the king-size and that peeps so you will get to see me sick you know why actually you won't get to see me skill up because this just shot a little bit isn't it there you go you see a bit better now so I'm put it in there peach do not put it in there although I am doing it sorry I'm doing it not much much it's enough in it it's enough even a little bit's enough even a little bit is too much coffee did you coffee oh by the way I'm not a groundout this was my dad's won some ropes is already here waiting for me now what are you smoking guys please let me know in the comment section and I know this show is really just to talk [ __ ] and try and do a review I don't really want to talk about other aspects of the channel but I will let you know something I'm working on another Amsterdam vlog and we should be coming out sometime in the next couple of years and we will be bringing back mash up from the cave my favorite show from from the channel really I really like them I really love making every like in there like alien animal I just like watching them mash up in the cave it takes so much work to do we're so much alien now some real light sir you know put loads of small details in put loads of small details in loads of small details in and they've been five episodes if you haven't checked out the playlist play this is there guys check them out but yeah I'll bring him back at some point and I'll just quit season to season to mush up in the case that was season one over and done with season two very similar they will just talk about the channel it's really just for people that are subscribed to the channel and just want to follow the story of what's going on with the channel with myself and people that are featured in it have you ever bring them back anyway not for talking about that this is not this this show is not for that if this show is for the weed this episode is for the Fruity Pebbles og Danny was in my pocket what the [ __ ] that [Music] Shh I hope you guys don't be bored wiping skinning up that's why usually cut it out but people do want to see me skin up they say so well one person has always good guys to let me know what you like and what you don't like light for the Jesus wait'll chip oh stop stop stop I even gave you the score for the smell now obviously it's quite a bit there is it's an OG you've got the og in there nowhere near as smelly as some oh geez nobody near the old genus that I love that rutti og stunk eNOS has probably been lost a little bit with the fruitiness the fruitiness it really comes over on that on that smell and I personally love the og taste and smell so anyway when I see it with a hero G in Australia yep yep yep and I've got that in my mind that I'm expecting that that delivery so a bit like um but like if someone on x-factor says they're gonna sing a Whitney Houston song and all you're gonna do is compare it to Whitney Houston aren't you and it better be [ __ ] on point because she was a good singer it's like really good oh geez and when you get a no Jean like oh why are they delivering to that Oh Jean standardless you know this one here is great but a lot more fruity than og so for taste I will give this seven a half here seven half averaging out right now at seven a half seven a half let's get to a bit more fun elements of their rating and they read the wheat viewing I should say the toast Charlie got real mate want to send me a lot of peeps I'll redo need some just give me light maybe like ten lights just seem about 1020 lighters I just firm around this this hi our shed cave look shed so your farm I'm a cave and no no oh there's a like that what was the light of their he's a dude just Rizla's weed you know Becky Becky but everything that you need rope just for it all around your room and don't pick it up and you'll never ever run out and you keep topping it up constantly to top in an opportunist like lose the packs they were wearing [ __ ] you know Roach cigarettes bars if were in your room or wherever you smoke where do you smoke let me know in the comment section what's as I said no smoke this drink for a while I'm it smoking a few strings to strings for the last maybe three four days it's the first time I was faint ain't different I like that actually I really like to not be reviewing these strains during the time I'm smoking them because yeah yeah as I said before that strange rain and you can adapt your tastes can adapt to it everything adapts to it I think when you get a strain you're smoking it too much not too much but you're smoking it quite a bit [Music] so where the smell didn't deliver for your true oh gee fans out there the taste does give you that Oh genus a lot more like you smell it you'd make your mind up that that's more less out it's gonna be when you start tasting it and that's not the case I think it's less frui more OG with the more skunky with the taste on this and for me that's that's good it's good I mean it means it can't go wrong can you aside be fruity or og and no strains of strains they did it tastes nice to go no I like when was the last time you tasted a bad strain mmm a little taste but yeah fruity or OGE out of them - I prefer to be open ye sorry up the vertigo G and this is he's doing that there's a light gasps this to it life smoke wear some thick murky og intakes occur with strains this one's nice and light st. nice as long as this this profession is quite quite then I could smoke I thought I could smoke this all the time and you know we meet Kane in my throat Oh anything like that and I know this is quite strong this is quite strong I'd say this is in the anyway up from like the 19 to 22 percent THC and if you're smoking it yeah I think yeah if you is like a not much of a smoker and you tasted this you you keep taking it you keep taking it you taking it doesn't really taste like it could be that strong I reckon all of a sudden you'd be a [ __ ] [ __ ] me I'm a mashed well this is the last bit of the fruity pebbles oh gee I'm sending a bite of it's depressing any when you say get a car I'm not smoking for a while oh yeah I remember this now this is very nice what a burrito keys me saying good bye until another time and will it be the same all the fruity pebbles be the same that's the thing you never know do you you never know if you're saying goodbye to that strain for the rest of your life the pressing Q the depressing music alright enough of that what we go right this has what are we gonna say out in I'm giving it a night yep I think I'm liking it a lot more than the the smell of it and definitely more of the sight of it yes going a night on the tastes we're gonna get an average score as I'm doing these reviews I'm working out roughly where this is going to finish up in the in the total total strain score and if we you know we're hitting you know yeah good to have Ridge good average strains in the 31 sort of mark really Rudy we shall be really good to go past that 32 mark I'm thinking this is gonna hit on mine about the 31 mark ish but yeah taste is eight effects well I can go back to when I was smoking this all the time and they did the job definitely the job not as strong as some of the other strains some of the other oh geez or even the fruity is some of the fruity strains I've got a lot of oranges right now although yeah this is this is actually this is definitely understand the origins I've got [Music] there's no real dry mouth to this or headaches or anything like that it was very clean feel very clean with a slight as I said it's a slight dirt in estimate but the effects yeah very very clean no no real baddies from this one they will cons from it I can say I'm gonna give this for your fix I'm gonna give it for the effects of from your pebbles Sophie I think do I quick before I change mine now yeah I for the effects of fruity pebbles if you agreed with me if you're not agreeing with me I'd love to know what you think of it if you have spread this string before please let us know I'm still thinking about every smoke every toke he's a closer to the final goodbye so I must be loving this train what did we score up as with seven laughs seven and a half eight and eight they were all coming up over here and the total score would be 16 yes for you I don't get it it's 31 Saiki doo doo doo I thought it should be higher I thought we should be higher and you know why I thought we should be higher I felt the site would have been a lot better had I have kept a bigger bud and reviewed this soon up I've had this for God's God's I'd say maybe six weeks now I think maybe it has that affected the site it's been looking well meat nicking bits and pieces off it doesn't read hell does it so yeah on light of this new got a bit higher on the strain score it hasn't yeah 31 oh well 31 for pebbles oh gee what's gonna be next on the string view I don't know check me out next Wednesday on weeds day this is Rizla this is Freddie really and ahahahaha things as well and chuck-e-cheese Chuckie so it's bang your head you're right thank you yes cool Yama is no this is drink anus thank you so much see you later bye smoke cigarettes and smoke cigars lovely board", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "-UDTRpQdabU": "there was a time where I would my favorite dope was anything given to me by a naked lady but I've changed you had to know a black eye a new Mexican bank and then quickly I knew white guys that would go down to Tijuana and buy a brick and then come back and then when you opened up the brick there'd be like a big this size saying a mold that's smoked really good I had a Chinese guy give me my first choice I didn't know when oh it's going to get the second choice so that first joint lasted about three months kids nowadays they just go to their mother's drawer yeah it's come to you today awesome we just like they're trying to borrow the car because being a half Chinese I learned how to order real change there is a difference so white people's Chinese food is called like number 35 anything that doesn't smell bad that's my Munchie food I've been getting them more lately than I ever did in my life did you get high man you'll eat [ __ ] the dog Morty sheesh has a problem with edibles I guess as long as we've been smoking weed he's still kin the Lord told me

involves more than striking a match you know like they pin their cool for a while but then I don't know how to reload them I skip how to do anything but I've done that then yeah hold on that bend it you know I'm cool teacher is still trying to figure out what's an edible yeah that's in my future I think in the future you can just think about one Indian the culture itself has been around forever

and our response was what if we're right and and we'd has medical benefits and all kinds of benefits right well right we are right we do only only if you're smoking with Snoop Dogg yeah Snoop Dogg
