{"-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not

take care of each other and until next time brothers and sisters keep smoking", "bzGdyneMAzU": "yo yo yo what's up G fam today guys hoppin straight into it it's been a long week for me it's been a stressful week for a lot of people guys I don't know if I'm ready to get into the situation to the topic yet I might save it for another video you know it's still kind of early but this week has been a rough week guys that's why I haven't been able to produce any content or anything like that so sorry if you guys haven't missed it on the videos but today I'm bringing you guys a quick [ __ ] the last the last of the tree-based guys tree-based clear the best one agent orange like literally probably by far the most potent one the most the the best-tasting one and the one that gets me the most [ __ ] faded so this one right here is a hybrid I didn't think a hybrid would get me that [ __ ] up but the times that I've been smoking it and everybody that let hit they're like [ __ ] bro this is literally the best the best one ever so yeah guys this is the packaging that it comes in it's a better upgrade than what they used to have they used to have just the regular little plastic ones where you could see through and it's like right there but you know got a step your game up if you want to being the best and then this tree I suppose they come in these little [ __ ] clear tubes and all professional so yeah guys Agent Orange look at this [ __ ] um I'm more than halfway through with it already look how clear that [ __ ] is you can see the holes everything like water like if there's nothing in there but yeah guys I'm pretty much halfway done with this and man like I still haven't gotten tired of it I'm not gonna lie with the other ones with the Mendo breath with the Wi-Fi og I got tired of them pretty quick I got tired of them within like 2 to 3 days and I was just like [ __ ] do you like on time I'm just waiting for the next one so this one is [ __ ] bomb though this is by far the best one Agent Orange you guys when you take a hit of it it literally takes like alright you guys know one you guys are gonna open a brand new [ __ ] fresh orange peel that [ __ ] that first little peel and you like you take a sniff and it's like orange peel like I don't know if you guys like that I mean it I like it so that's what it tastes like guys it's nothing artificial there's no official flavoring like just like a little hint of like orange peel that's probably why they call it Agent Orange and [ __ ] it's hot today sorry guys I keep wiping my sweat off but it's [ __ ] hot today it's already [ __ ] 4 o'clock and it's 93 degrees though so we're gonna smoke on this [ __ ] I tell you guys how I feel I'm sober right now so I'm gonna tell you guys how this [ __ ] makes me feel what I like about it what I don't like about it and we're gonna go straight through the review guys so turn off the [ __ ] air real quick so you guys can see these fat ass clouds and this one actually produces a lot more vapor than all the other ones I'm not sure why but it produces a pretty good amount watch [ __ ] delicious and what I like about these cartridges men but to never it's never a boring hit like even though I didn't like the men doe breath and the Wi-Fi og that much I still enjoyed them just because it was a really strong high like compare compare it to like brass knuckles and heavy hitters and all those other shit's like this is pretty top-notch quality and I understand why you have to pay $40 for half a gram you know I I mean I do kind of wish it would be a little bit lower maybe in the 30 35 range because 40 is pretty absurd like you can get you can go out and get yourself something not as good but pretty much up there in quality for $50 full gram and this is 40 for half gram so it's kind of like you know 5050 this is definitely after trying all four of these and after having these for probably like two weeks I I'd say if you have the money go ahead and go buy it if you don't have the money don't don't sweat it you know you I'm sure a time will come when you'll be able to afford it but don't be killing yourself over this Sh it's definitely it's worth it though it's worth it like I'll tell you that it's definitely worth it if you have the money and you're debating it what should I get is it worth it yeah it's definitely worth it and I've tried pretty much for now I'm pretty sure I've tried every single tree based flavor that on the market that they have I think the only one I haven't tried it is the gelato but I'm not really a fan of gelato wax cuz you know for me I like smoking the the real weed from burner for a more originated originated from so I think everything else is pretty much a knockoff so yeah guys so we're gonna keep talking on this I'm outside the gym right now and put it I'm gonna hit the gym after this [ __ ] this [ __ ] always has me feeling good I go into the gym and I just like get in my zone and I start working out guys so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your state and make sure you guys are smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on in the [ __ ] description I'm about to turn the [ __ ] air on his hot and ya guys Cheers mmm all I ever take is like probably two to three hits max to this because it is potent like like I said in last video guys this [ __ ] has to be the most herpes cartridge on the market like the hit that you get from it it's like no other eye I've smoked so much [ __ ] in my life nothing nothing hits me this hard no no I mean other than like dabs and [ __ ] like that but like from cartridge wise this is probably by far the best one one thing one thing guys I know I know some of you guys might want to wait for this but I know they they just announced on their Instagram that they're gonna be releasing one gram cartridges and I'm wondering I'm trying to guess how much with OSHA's they're gonna cost like you think they're gonna cost the same amount they're gonna call as like two of these would cost you know $80 [ __ ] $75 but I don't know guys we'll see we'll see what they [ __ ] decide on what the pricing is going to be hopefully it's not too much because I know I know usually come B's charge for the cartridge itself because I know the cartridges are pretty expensive they're like 5 to 10 a pop I heard and then so hopefully it's not that expensive and we're gonna take one last rip of this guy's hopefully this coming week I am able to do some more content it's still gonna be a pretty busy month in my in my opinion we'll see how it goes but yeah it's good I'm soaking to be pretty busy guys but now that I'm reaching I'm getting higher in my um subscribe go and view count I know my evaders I've been popping off lately and I appreciate that I love you guys shout out for all the people watching my videos commenting on my videos you guys keep me [ __ ] motivated and keep it going and I wanna probably soon pause I started maybe this week next week I don't know whenever I find out I'm I'm probably gonna start live streaming for at least an hour to two hours a day I want to start streaming probably for at night and might be streaming the new blackout if you guys would be interested in the new color TV for I'll probably be streaming that [ __ ] and then cuz I what what my plan is now that once I hit 100 I wanted that that pretty much gives me a decent amount of people that watching me I would say you know 100 people so every time I livestream I were to get a couple like 20 30 or whatever the cases and basically what I wanted to do is just live stream and have more people from other communities like the Fortnight community come in and watching and check out my [ __ ] and let's see if they if they like my content and they go ahead and hit the subscribe button you guys know how it goes so you guys should be seeing some more [ __ ] like that I'm gonna probably be getting into more different [ __ ] I'm kind of getting over the wax game or the cartridge game because I feel like I've tried everything this tree base right here with best on the [ __ ] best on the market right now so I really don't know what to try man I know I want I probably want to head out to cookies because I checked out their Instagram and I saw that they have a collaboration with them with the G with the G pins you know guys are no little [ __ ] so you put wax pins and hit it they have a collaboration with those so I want to maybe go pick one of those up see if they're not a [ __ ] expensive there because they're shit's always are overpriced as [ __ ] to go run for like a hundred a gram is stupid but [ __ ] man that [ __ ] has me fade I don't even be able to go to the gym right now but yeah guys if you guys liked today's video make sure to go leave a like make sure to go leave a comment make sure to hit that subscribe button and make sure to share with your friends I'll be creating some more better video sorry guys if this is like not the best video like I said I have been dealing with issues within my family so it's not my mindset isn't in on making videos you know my mindset is elsewhere and I know when you guys know how it is when your mind isn't set on one thing it's hard to focus on that thing and it's hard to work towards that thing but hopefully you guys understand and hopefully you guys stick around so the other guys schedule later", "Jlrrhr4_zOM": "hey up trevor here with thread of the leaf and today we're going to be diving into our 510 vape cartridge the company has honestly put out my favorite tasting cartridge so far and i'm really looking forward to seeing how this one's going to be due tropic girl scout cookies is the one that kind of blew my mind and really left me impressed today we've got the one gram edition of their grapefruit kush i'm a big fan of the citrus flavor i'm a big fan of the kush flavor let's see how they cross and blend together but we got to do that after we get this intro in here cheers and i'll see you over on the other side welcome back you guys and like i said in the intro we're diving into the grapefruit cush 510 vape cartridge from general admission this is going to be the 1 gram while the the 0.95 so the essentially one gram edition of their cartridges i was really really impressed by the tropic girl scout cookies i absolutely loved that cartridge and then the lemon ice would be my second favorite with the berry g33 coming in third and the tropic thunder coming in lastly it wasn't that it was a bad flavor it just the other ones were so much more enjoyable so much more potent for me to be able to sit down and enjoy and that's why they just ranked a little bit better the effects as well were a big component on it now before we get into actually reviewing this uh cartridge i'm going to walk you guys through exactly how we're going to do that it's that if you need to skip through or you want to get ahead to exactly what you'd like to smoke you can go ahead and do that now when we go and review this sucker we first read off the information on our package and then we go into the website information i like to go with the license producers website if it's not available move over to either the alberta cannabis uh sales or our ontario cannabis sales site and use that and then finally if i can't find any information on there i will move into leafly or uh lift and go as the strain information so we go as as specific as we can to the most generic information that i'm able to find for you with it still being accurate towards that strain after that we actually get into the full review with our cartridges we crack into the box and we screw it into our uber battery this battery gets ran at three temperatures we started out at the slowest we at the slowest at the lowest and we work our way all the way up to the highest we go green blue red and then we move on over into our g pen and the g pen's the opposite because we go blue green then red before we put on our hamper adapter right here and we run it through our rigs each of the pens individually will get scored out of 10 and then the rigs between both both pens so the six pulls that we'll be making through all three temperatures so one at each through each pen in two different rigs that'll be scored together and ranked not ranked but scored out of 10 you guys after that we talk about the high and then we move into our overall before we wrap this video up but we've got about 20 minutes of smoking to get into so let's go ahead and do that but first let's cover the information so that you guys know exactly what we're diving into the grapefruit cush cartridge from general mission is going to be a dominant indica strain it is going to be a pure thc cartridge so they're one two oh option came in with a thc total of 83.2 percent a cbd total of 0.21 it has a package date of the 30th of december and a price point of 56.99 on the alberta cannabis website you guys now if we move over into that website we will quickly be able to cover the information that hopefully general mission provides to the albertagunapist.org grapefruit kush bringing the zen you're looking for from an indica but with enough oomph to keep you up rejoice citrus fans this card has the flavor you crave made for the masses general emission vapes use ethanol extractions to concentrate strains into thc distillate infused with botanical terpenes with this vape you have everything you need for a great time compatible with a 510 thread cartridge or 510 thread device device is not included so this contains grapefruit cush 0.95 grams in a pre-filled vape cartridge the licensed producer is decibel cannabis company the brand is general emission your food allergens contains nothing the device compatibility is a 510 thread that is not included expected durability is about 365 days it's grown in a greenhouse then it goes into the package settings and then extraction process is ethanol directions atomizer automatically activates upon an inhalation device not included the terpene and the flavor profile is going to be citrus and earthy and musky the ingredients are thca thc distillate and botanical terpene blends so i saw that health canada had health canada has made an adjustment to flavors in the vaporizers and they now are considering them to be treated the same as the nicotine and tobacco based product vaporizers so i'm not sure how this is going to affect the botanical terpene blends being added because you're not supposed to be adding flavors to it so i don't know how this is going to be affected i don't know how it's really going to change things up but i'm going to have to keep an eye on it and potentially do another video on that but the time being you guys we've got this cartridge open we're going to get into this strain this grapefruit kush from general mission i'm really looking forward to it i hope you guys are as well that one gram cartridge has a real nice look to it but the urban scale intro is coming in for you guys to enjoy the review cheers as we add another thc sticker to the collection on the torch i i honestly don't know why i started doing that i just started doing that so we took that thc sticker off it's time to take off the nice silicone caps on this cartridge screw it into our uber battery and get this review rocking so initial kind of hopes and thoughts that i'm want from this cartridge it being an indica dominant strain i want that body based effect especially with that kush if it could go heavy with that body based ease and relaxation where i could use it for pain relief and that kind of just body tense that body just that ease right like that relaxation that you need when you're just getting frustrated throughout the day you just need that nice little like the captain on bad boys the woosa moment and if you guys yeah that's what i'm kind of hoping for is a wuzow moment with this cartridge now flavors i'm hoping for that really citrus sweet initial onset and then that earthy rich flavor to uh to follow up on the exhale and that would be a good combination for me and a little bit of a mental stimulation i wouldn't have anything to complain about but we're on the green setting for the uber that means we're on the lowest let's start working our way through the settings and scoring this sucker out of 10 40 is going to be our total i'm i'm excited to see how this grapefruit kush does choose you guys really smooth inhale it was wouldn't say cooling like the cushman's was or like a menthol experience at all because it definitely didn't have that it had more of like the vitamin c halls where it's got that little bit of a uh like cooling light cool is just the best word to describe it where it's just nice like a fresh sip of ice water where your mouth just stays nice and that couple degrees colder than the rest of your body for that those few seconds that's the experience that you have when you have a mouth full of this paper and it does go in and that the hall the vitamin c halls the grapefruit vitamin c halls is the best way i can describe this cartridge at that lowest setting really nice really smooth if you take a big haul off of it i have a feeling that it's going to get a little bit more rich more earthy because that grapefruit did start to transition a little bit near the end of that haul and i wanted to cut it off before we moved up the temperature in this one i'll take a little bit of a longer haul on it to see if i can kind of activate that earthy cushy tone or maybe it's just the temp because we should be able to find out relatively quick with this hall but if we continue with this kind of rich potent flavor this cartridge is going to score quite well you guys let's uh find out if um the next temperature is going to consistently develop upon the original cheers okay guys there's something definitely changing in the flavor of this cartridge as we increase the temperature we increase the haul the like the volume of the hull i definitely had a lot more of a rich flavor like i lost that sweet it went more with that really rich and tart grapefruit flavor and then near the final portion of the exhale got a little bit more of that rhiney side where it's got that kind of earth and rudy touch to it that i'm enjoying you guys it's a nice blend it's a nice transition i'm curious to see what the highest temp is going to do with the overall because it it has some potential to really do well but if it if it goes a little funky on us in this high high setting it's it's gonna lose some points really quick because it's ranking for top three top three scores folks let's see if the the final one is gonna give it it's gonna put its nails and it's in its final score so let's see how it does cheers with this cartridge i'm actually going to have to wait to score it from the vuber that last strip i got was really really potent really really like really strong on the flavor and it's it's making me want to give it a nine like i'm i won't give it a 10 because it wasn't that potent all the way through and the fact that i now know that there's that potential for potency all the way through i can't give it a 10. now my issue with this and the reason why i want to wait until after i do the first and only the first strip out of this is i want to see if it's an airflow thing airflow based flavor change because with our vuber and our g pen i know we've gone over this a little bit you guys but the port size difference between the two because you've got the uber straight forward you can see now and then the g pen straight forward the g pen moves a lot more air with a lot less hat like the hall can be the exact same but this will move more air just because the ports are larger now with that being said that last rip i really haul on those high high temps because i want to fill my lungs i want to get a nice full pull on it without cooking the oil the higher the temp the harder i pull it's just how how i am even with my dabs it's the same way um so i want to wait and see if it's an airflow thing because i'm going to pull lightly on this one and if i get that potent flavor we're going to bump the vuber down to an 8 just because the g pen is likely to get that nine because it's got the potency but i want to give it the buffer for that ten because if the flavor isn't really great but the potency is better like for the changes between the temperatures this one's gonna do well but i think i've explained it long enough i've given my lungs in time to settle because that last one did did catch um the one a little bit off guard so there was a little bit extra coffin on it so let's dive back into the cartridge and see if uh we're going to be giving that vuber an 8 or a 9. cheers you guys you know what i'm going to give it a 9 because this g pen is approaching it a little bit differently the extra airflow seems to have completely changed the flavor and the experience i'm having and that could also be because we're getting into a little bit of a warmer cartridge and it's changing the flavor that way but where i had sweet and fruity on the initial flavor there i've got rich and spiced like the citruses transition into kind of a sharp spice tone i'm enjoying it a lot now with that being said we're going to move up to the next temp see what the green does let's see if it goes to the sweeter or more that cushy tone because it could swing either either way right now you guys because i'm getting a nice blend of the two let's find out so air movement is a major thing with this cartridge i will 100 attest to that this one is moving a lot more air and a lot less time the halls themselves i'm honestly finding these are a little bit lighter in the overall experience like you're not getting as dense of a cloud i find that the uber is a little bit denser of a of a experience when i'm smoking not necessarily the actual amount of smoke but it just feels denser because the lack of the airflow this one i just lightly haul on like if i hauled on this one i'll get more out of it but just general this one feels more aired out which personally i don't mind the g pen or either the g pen or the warmer cartridge seems to be leaning a little bit more on that cushy side it seems to be losing some of that sweetness and go a little bit more with the rich side which i am loving now that being said there is still a nice rich citrus tone to it that definitely doesn't leave you upset it doesn't leave you disappointed by any means it's just there and present to enjoy and uh it's left me quite interested to drive into the last temp and see how that's going to hold up to the boomer because this will decide if this is gonna have matching nines or an eight and honestly i've been leaning more to the eight just because the flavor hasn't been as intense has been as dense as i said earlier but let's smoke it find out yes i'm going to bump the g pen down to an 8 you guys and really that last pull i got off of it was quite similar to the last pull i got off of the uber but the flavor seems to dissipate with that g pen which we seem to have found with some of our other cartridges that the extra large ports i wouldn't even say extra large ports but just the larger ports are not a benefit to some cartridges where others it is the winning point to it and it really is why i like having a couple of different batteries because certain batteries work better for certain carts um and then there's some carts like um the tangio g from good supply that just gets spiked smoke the entire way through um but that's the story for another day for the time being we're going to keep on rocking the g pen i am going to give an 8. it was enjoyable it had some nice characteristics but it just it underperformed the boober because i was thinking you're either gonna get more intense flavor or you're gonna get less in flavor and we've got the less inside now getting into the uber battery again we're gonna go with our mad hatter rig this time and smoke our way through the temperatures and the only difference this time is we preheat the last one because it's uh just a little bit different of a approach to get flavors and the overall impression of this cartridge but for the time being let's go ahead and uh start working our way through the rings cheesy guys and let's see how these score after these six ribs looks like we accidentally started on the highest temp so we'll be preheating medium temps this round every time it tends to happen to me cheesy guys let's get into it and preheat this medium temp we'll do it the right way with our g pen you guys cheers again it's the battery you guys has to be the battery i got nothing but sweet sweet grapefruit i know i know the intensity of the grapefruit and the juicy side of the grapefruit has to do with the water but okay let's just get a drink of water settle this [ __ ] diaphragm down we're good okay so really juicy really fruity flavor we got through the mad hatter rig and honestly i'm gonna give the juicy side of the credit to the water you add water to it you get those sweet flavors it always tends to make a more juicy more fruity for me especially on the citrus side this grapefruit came out super super sweet and incredibly candied when it came through that rig and then you add the water and you get the juiciness in there as well it's it tastes like a goddamn fresca and i love it i absolutely love it through the rig and that voober battery is probably the way i'll end up smoking this rig this rig this cart just because that citrus juicy flavor is my more preferred way to smoke it especially because the intensity is better on that looper battery now with that being said we're going to do the exact same thing that we just did over on the other cartridge but we're going to do it the right way and finish it off with a high temp so with that being said let's go through quickly dive into these three halls and uh if this puts out any flavor similar to that uber cartridge we're probably gonna be looking at an eight or nine you guys i'm uh i'm thinking we're gonna be getting one of our first beautiful herbagees in a little while so let's get into it you guys cheers why are we not getting no function what in okay we have cart problems so when we have connection issues for me i typically find i've got that little get that little piece right in the middle that one right there the hole in it i find that all you need to do is lift that up just a touch so that it gets contact with the sensor plate and you're good to go so god damn that was kind of tasty that one now let's get to this folks cheers moving on to the second one this is gonna score incredibly well you guys if this stays like this this is gonna be if i get the same flavor through all six reps we're gonna have our first ten folks let's get to it tens across the board for this rig not one hoot was a disappointment the last one was the least potent of the flavor but it was also the most like it had the strongest effect in the sense of as soon as i took that big deep breath in it just clicked in and it was quite enjoyable you guys tasted like fresca that's about that's the best way i can describe it you guys it tastes like fresca it's really nice it's still lingering you take a drink it still sits there and settles in on your tongue and honestly it's a really really enjoyable smoke i am quite impressed with how this turned out you guys very very impressed with how this turned out now moving into the high i'm only going to give this a 7 out of 10 for the high the biggest reason for that is it's not that overwhelming that strong it's a really light um intensity with the exception of that that last rip i got a nice big rush and then it passed right away like it was in and out almost like the smoke was right that vapor that's really what i found it does give you a nice creative um easing like overall i'm feeling a little bit lighter a little bit less worried about what's going on my mind's being able to really put together what i want to say and it's and it's easy like the words are coming together nicely it's flowing really easy it feels like this is running a lot smoother than it was at the beginning it's that kind of an experience i'm finding you guys just overall that that creative confidence with that being said it doesn't have much of a body high it doesn't really have much of an overwhelming experience in the least it's just got that little bit of an initial buzz when you take a big haul off of it and then there's just a little bit of that creative uplift and ease and like caught mouth and a little bit of the heavier eyelids just for the squinting right it's not necessarily that you're baked it's just you get like you're ready to go to bed it's just you get that little bit of that heavy eyelid so you get a little bit more squinty but with that you guys it did really really well like incredibly well it ended up getting let's quickly do the math a 34 out of 40 and that does put it in the beautiful herbage marker without a question i'm i'm quite impressed with how well this cartridge did and honestly the flavor is where it took it this this is a cartridge that i'm going to be able to sit down and smoke my way through and enjoy the flavor the high is more complimentary it's not really that intense but it will be that dessert kind of strain where it's like okay i i don't really want to get any more baked than i am but i just want something good to taste and just hit it nice and light little halls give you that nice little um little uplift near the end of the day or even in the morning i'm looking forward to uh smoking the rest of this 0.95 gram cartridge but for the time being you guys we're going to wrap this one up i hope you

what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos

that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think

] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried

next word", "RBpsFKdqaHw": "I try to get to you know one or two shows a year like the American Jail Association or the American Corrections Association Jamie Mosley is a successful inventor who started a company and made a lot of money with an e-cigarette designed to be smoked in jails specifically his Jail how we doing on time you know 15 minutes Mosley is the jailer of Laurel County Kentucky he says he came up with his cigarette which he calls cross bar out of necessity when I developed the product it was really not with the intention of starting a company I was just trying to solve a problem with within my own facility Kentucky banned all tobacco products in jails in the mid-2000s over concerns about secondhand smoke it may have made inmates healthier but Mosley says it also made his life as a jailer a lot harder you know many of these inmates are coming in in a very intoxicated state whether that be from drugs heroin coming off of all of that and then without a cigarette at the same time sometimes can create very very volatile situations the idea for a jail specifically cigarette came quickly figuring out how to make one that inmates couldn't use as a weapon took a little longer one of our main objectives when we started was to be able to do this I mean everything out there had a metal casing or was a very very hard plastic casing that could be hammered down into a shank we've dressed that fairly easily but we also wanted something with a very low voltage so that you couldn't utilize it for an ignition source to start a fire with but we wanted something that was very you got to think of everything like that you do and that's the big advantage I guess that I have you know I live with 550 inmates every single day and I understand their behavior 986 today okay so you're gonna get the inmates ID make sure he is who he is give him his ID back next thing you want to go do is you're going to check and make sure this is the one I sold him last time I came around these men in Mosley's jail are part of a specialized drug rehabilitation program for them ethics are a useful crunch how'd you end up here well my drug addiction led me here cocaine charge and a theft charge and I've been here going on 90 days well you know their facilities where they did where they didn't have any e-cigarette option uh yes I've been another for sale these fake and has no way to go up sir down there so what's that like when you show up there and you have nothing oh it's nerve wracking this imagining won't for smoking two packs of cigarettes on the straight to nothing what what do you think when you got here found out they had this I was thought I was in Haven for a minute you know if you know Mosley's invention may help keep inmates happy but it's also a lucrative business cross bar is available in some 33 prisons and jails nationwide and the company is expected to do three and a half million dollars in sales this year you know there are also of course kind of a classically captive audience for your for your own product they're addicted yeah and they don't have any other choices you know we're not trying to capitalize on the or develop customer base you know to sell these people beyond release it's a tool and it was designed for the benefit of the facilities and if it helps them to cooperate and keeps my officers safer that that's a win-win for everybody it also means a lot of revenue for the jails they buy each ecig for Mosley for two to three dollars and then sell them to inmates at ten to fifteen bucks a pop at Mosley's Jail which buys the e-cigs at cost the proceeds are put back into things that benefit inmate welfare something kentucky state law mandates so one of the first things that we did was we brought in an electronic health record system this is an item that a typical jail would not be able to afford with everything that we got was about seventy-five and dollars and we were able to purchase that through our commissary proceeds that the profits that were generated from the sale of our electronic cigarette we will regularly phone to the register of course the people who pay for these benefits are the inmates themselves it's considered a luxury yeah it is definitely exclusive items my dad he's the one buying them for me so I don't I don't like to ask for anything so the cost of them gonna keeps me from smoking them as Muslim we heard there the the number one purchase at the commissary itemizing they probably are are you helping inmates or are you also kind of exploiting them to um you know I think that's a great question I think the same thing can be said for should we begin from caffeine are we making their blood pressure go up because we're getting on chips and have sowed they were loaded with sodium if you own the chip company I can't figure out if this is like a story about you know all the things you're able to do because of the e-cigs or if it's a story about a jailer who saw an opportunity and made a whole lot of money I guess that'll be for everybody else to decide when they say it making money selling e-cigs is very easy that keeping people alive and helping people is very hard my heart and my passion is here [Music] you", "kMzJvwG2rsQ": "[Music] I'm in the city that used to be called Saigon renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the country's leader during the Vietnam War it's more than 40 years since the conflict ended but its effects I still felt everywhere this is to maternity hospital in Ho Chi Minh City now dr. Furr is based there and she's a tireless campaigner when it comes to making people all over the world aware of the connection between Agent Orange and children born with deformities I'm here to visit something called a peace village one of 13 she has set up she believes many of the children in them have been affected by Agent Orange a defoliant dropped by u.s. forces everybody wants to speak to you this is the peace village would you mind showing me dr. B indeed got Fleur he's internationally respected for her work though she's 77 she feels she can't fully retire she texts me first to meet a little girl called champ you seen cliff valley here south on kaboodle come so this is a child his parents were affected by Asian origin it's flying and these are all signs of children who have been affected by Agent Orange yeah you see five deformities recognized Friday scientific communities versus neural tube defects the quantities of sensory organs the Siamese twins revelation cleft lip and deformities of limbs those deformities are common in Vietnam dr. foie told me that a research study she conducted showed that birth defects in Agent Orange sprayed areas were three or more times higher than other places we take care of many children I think that why the Agent Orange about 60% of them have parents directly exposed to the Agent Orange during war or after but the war was years ago why is it still affecting children now this is third and fourth generation one thing is that they have seen can be transmitted from mother to the babies the Agent Orange used during the war contained a dangerous chemical called dioxin dr. Furr and many scientists believe it can lead to genetic mutations studies where mice were given dioxin showed this it's hard to prove in humans but doctor for herself is convinced that generations of Vietnamese children are being affected some children here were abandoned at birth for some it's a lifelong home like Lloyd okay and this baby very happy you like the big brother yes a big family this your place yes come because Loy was born in an area affected by Agent Orange one of the senior doctors told me they think there's a good chance his disability is dioxin related so you sleep in this room tell me about when you were a baby do you remember much about when you were a baby Keith oh hey mom mom toy yeah Dan boy Hakan young you know none my guy live or die would you rather be living at home with your family no maybe young nothing young a young deputy campaign someone I knew more Gannon woman no getting done are they got and go ahead Jesus am i got em young women damn be this piece village ward is amazing and the work that's been done is incredible but I mean the harsh realities if what doctor first is same about the connection between Agent Orange and the deformities that these kids are suffering is true you know she says 60% of them you know are connected to Agent Orange then the harsh realities they are war victims and war victims they're paying for a war that happened over half a century ago and the sad thing is most of us have forgotten about it [Music] Agent Orange was essentially a weed killer but much much stronger it was used by the American forces to destroy the jungle their enemy used for cover the production process he cause contamination with the most toxic form of dioxin known as TCDD the levels in Agent Orange make it one of the most dangerous chemicals ever manufactured between 1961 and 1971 in that 10-year period the US Army dropped millions of gallons of Agent Orange over jungle like this to strip it of all of its foliage which entire team my mind's eye it looks cool rocky not a youngling oh why am i checking my being it he'd [ __ ] it off dang it that's a take multi mr. Sun is a decorated Vietnam War veteran he tells us he's the only one in his platoon that survived the war wait damn do I die Moon's up so far veto go pre-matching up guys don't even know look that new take on modernize how the LA Zoo it Kaito China there are blocking Mukti open sir will you directly affected by Agent Orange did it hit you I told you to keep hit hit [ __ ] at all Zola I can assume that sooner do you mean that no one I'm not gonna lie I'm not going to corner sons daughter boy who is 41 is severely disabled and is classified by the government as an agent orange victim because of her father's exposure during the war at Eden cause after sir until that night leave that man hangout named Lonnie Jung this I'm opening know so somebody can cause I can unite let the feet whatever sorry mother Wolverine um based on the limited studies that have been done the Vietnam Red Cross estimate those affected by Agent Orange at around 3 million of whom 150,000 are children with birth defects the government provides a monthly payment to over 200,000 families to lift [Music] their son home is 38 and a celebrated monochord musician and composer he's gradually gone blind you and your sister and your parents are known as Agent Orange victims how does that make you feel the final call it is a viola no no cams and he what only family you know what I mean oh I okay tornado clarity already maybe they don't in la fecha de of the cantina cos they play music where confetti hey mi casa Helicon gone in the his own he's a young guy to a Kurumi do you ever feel angry or frustrated that what has happened to you ko-teng boy you guys we need what comes up you love me that's how I mean okay couch in China in Montevideo didn't know class wake up to tempo Conway I knew what what lovely people and you know I'm guessing that when son left the army he was probably hoping to leave behind the war and all the memories of the atrocities but birth of these kids and the fact that they're both disabled mean that his family can never forget Vietnamese doctors are concerned parents affected by Agent Orange are passing on genetic defects to their children but they're also worried about the fact there are still areas heavily contaminated with dioxin one of them is vana airbase which is right behind me and it's been quoted of having dioxin levels that are 350 times higher than the international safety standards now we've been told that there are us specialists in there at the moment carrying out a cleanup operations but what I think is absolutely nuts is that the only thing that's separating the Vietnamese population from one of the most contaminated places on the planet is of why offense then Aang was the main u.s. airbase during the war where huge stockpiles of Agent Orange were stored the chemical residue remained seeping into their names water supply and getting into the food chain the US government has donated millions in aid to cleanup Danang and other hotspots working with the Vietnamese government to Da Nang Association for victims of Agent Orange introduced me to one of the families whose children might have been affected by dioxin their dad served in the Army after the war but went to areas that had been sprayed and he believes that he may have passed on the effects to his young son who's now in Da Nang hospital fighting for his life I'm gonna go and meet him dip has had heart problems all of his knife but was recently rushed to hospital when things took a turn for the worse his parents meaning hai have to take it in turns to give him constant care at the moment you can't lie down because it's too painful he has to sleep propped up he needs a heart transplant yeah and how much would it cost a little at a time so it's about $40,000 and how will you get that money what do you think has caused dips problems even our messenger that I believe in [Music] dibbs heart defect is on the list of conditions that the Vietnamese government associate with Agent Orange but his family could also just be unlucky ir s-- tips doctor what he thinks speaking to his parents they believe that his illness could have been caused by Agent Orange because his father worked in the Army and he moved through contaminated fields anything can happen so until now the exactly cause is not clear the problem is not only have they got to deal with their son who is in so much pain but they don't know the reason but medicine will have a limited yeah so we know what is happening in that body but we don't know the cause exactly there's no tests that can prove a genetic illness has been caused by Agent Orange what is these last few months been like for you calm down calm down the puppeteer they will be home you're done dropped it upon nothing okay [Music] it's not just exposure to Agent Orange in the past that worries dips father he believes his village is still affected by it since our Ming I'd really love for you to show me how this area was impacted by Agent Orange [Music] [Music] Loic on your line oh yeah black on black hmm very cool baby come come come back now so in this area can you not grow any more crops from combat hunger attack do you think the reason for the poor crops is because of Agent Orange I doubt they do come with you know what can we learn techno-pop no can you learn okay no no no tater I'm gonna take these you're gonna Randall don't attack them we were told by the Dan hang Association for victims of Agent Orange that it was stored near here but that no tests have been done to check dioxin levels some men can't know for sure but he's convinced his family have been at risk hello even though it's very sick dippers ask to come home from hospital [Music] EAL my why did you want to come back home I meet the rest of the family I know your son he also has problems as well don't worry about me do you mind if we see your stomach another cookie but you're in porn and after you write because men can't prove he was exposed to dioxin the family can't get any compensation you can see how much they really cherish having yet back home man it was Depp who actually requested to be brought back home because he wanted to be around the people who loved him but what just keeps sticking with me and keeps it means that they will never ever know for sure what has caused their son's illnesses and all they can do is just enjoy these precious moments that they have left sadly just a week after my visit dear passed away it could be lack of funds it could be lack of will or that the science is very hard but I'm shocked at how much still needs to be done to understand the effects of Agent Orange I go to see dr. foot back at the peace village I know you've been working all day today's how do you feel when you see all of these children here whose parents have been affected by Agent Orange and they've passed it on to their children they're people who cause such crimes they don't recognize their responsibilities for example the chemical companies they still there and they don't have any responsibility I think everybody must get angry with them in 2008 dr. four was a key witness when Vietnamese groups tried to sue the u.s. chemical companies that made Agent Orange they lost because the US Court ruled its use didn't violate the rules of war and that the u.s. government and manufacturers weren't aware of all the risks to human health without admitting liability for the effects of Agent Orange the US government has given 21 million dollars to help disabled people in Vietnam living in sprayed areas dr. Fleur would like more and how difficult is it for a family who give birth to a child who's affected by Agent Orange first of all is that to face people living around you see they say that oh you have done something so that that punish you to give you such a child so they get a lot of stigma from the people around because they have very strong they most of them are very poor because they live in the spread areas in the warzone experience if you go for them to take care of such a child before I leave Vietnam I want to catch up with the peace villages Big Brother no no you go to train now yes I now was women he's a fellow athlete I've dropped in on a photoshoot ins friends of doing for noise social media profile less our success story from the peace village took up Paralympics women represents Vietnam and now he's having a photo shoot look at him he's a star with all of this training you're doing do you want to try and make it into the team for 2020 for the Paralympics in Tokyo as I make this what to win gold yeah no no no go oh you got your medals Wow Asian para games my MA yeah my MA all very special I know tell me about your disability your condition you know do you know much about the history and the reasons don't wave and I'ma be Bonita unite he like come be quantum lamp we hang time and gamma qu some powerful there you're really confident smiling all the time in it but do you think some of the other children here do you think they will have more problems when they go out into society when love move yourself a yo-yo like Joker a man so totin man man nice sound booth doing them up and over like quick talk comma like a heavy heart la latina so happy mm I know it's hard it's about who you are as a person not your disability yeah thank you I love Lloyd's attitude he's a huge inspiration and perhaps represents the next generation of you forwards in Vietnam [Music] no one is gonna accept blame for what happened in a dreadful war but if the US and Vietnam got together to investigate the effects of Agent Orange further it might stop more children being born with terrible disabilities [Music]", "2n7mK3dYOLw": "have a look behind me you can see boots with lasers tied tossed over electric wires it means that this district is under the protection of a gang that manages the area you can't just come here really when we arrived we were asked to stay in the car our attendant went to talk to particular people only after this were we greeted and allowed [Music] today i will show you how people live in a country where you should only walk the street holding things you are ready to give away to folks with guns who will surely find you sooner rather than later today we will visit the most terrifying districts where 30 people shot per day is kind of normal most of the crimes happen in these districts robbery murders kidnapping we will also pay a visit to the local upper east side huge gulf fields and they are not empty unlike shelves in the shops we will find out why a portion of fries in mcdonald's costs 130 dollars when you eat these fries you're getting from time to time this stuff which is unchewable tastes kind of like wood we will also visit the venezuelan carnival [Music] venezuela is an amazing country because a full tank of gas costs around 8 cents whereas toilet paper is 8.42 venezuela is an amazing country because it has one of the richest oil reserves in the world yet the income level per capita hardly climbs over ten dollars by the way i was really lucky with the drone shooting because now in venezuela you can really go to jail if you're caught flying one recently there was an assassination attempt on maduro a drone flew as close to him as possible and then exploded since then anyone with the drone has been arrested that's why i'm sincerely grateful to our cameraman by the way people at the end of the video i will run a contest with prizes that i've personally brought from south america a collectible bottle of rum one boulevard that is super hard to find now and i will say why my name is leodov and you know me from the people channel now i will show how people live in the most unusual places on the planet subscribe and like the channel right now this is our program how people live for the second year in a row analytics company gallup has been listing venezuela amongst the most dangerous countries in the world the number of murders per hundred thousand citizens is 81.4 yes if someone stops you and demands money or something else just silently raise your hands and give him all you have i heard it's better not to look them in the eyes because the number one rule is if there's too much hassle and it's easier to shoot you he will simply shoot you these cases are hardly ever cracked it's actually getting darker in the street now and i'm walking with a phone in my pocket no match to holding camera on the head level like who would even notice you probably shouldn't do that on my way from the airport i was told that recently a couple of days before my arrival a russian was attacked he was just walking to the shop not suspecting any threat he tried to resist and was eventually hit in the forehead with a butt of a gun as a result brain concussion and all the money he had was stolen another story happened to a delegation going by car they were stopped at the traffic light and while the criminals were trying to take off the wedding ring apparently gold they broke the man's finger the main type of transport in the venezuelan barriers are motorbikes small houses in the street are built as close as possible traditionally most of the crimes happen exactly in these districts robbery murders [Music] kidnappers the situation is so drastic that a couple of years ago venezuela military were ordered not to drive in the night time because the robbers would hunt them to get a free load of kalashnikovs the same order instructed the military not to use mobile phones when standing at traffic lights during the daytime actually traffic robbery is typical not only for venezuela but for all of latin america especially for brazil tourists usually go to the local favelas with attendance and for cash for example in the patare district 30 killed over the weekend is around normal [Music] this is how a typical shooting in a venezuelan favela looks one group is on the roof a guy falls after a gunshot another one is hiding behind the corner of a house for you to see how habitual such a mess is for the locals have a look at the guy in shorts first he runs around with a gun then he gets tired comes over to his house has a relaxed chat with his wife then simply takes the plate to eat some porridge and apparently waits for the police most of the killings in the barrio result from the fights amongst local gangs so the police don't even bother i heard you can rent a revolver here for 60 dollars per day but judging by the situation i don't really trust these numbers i think it's much cheaper other districts are pretty peaceful in the daytime the centre of caracas doesn't look like a district in the world's most dangerous city at all though statistically caracas does top the list a couple of kiosks with ice cream that people live in to put it mildly simpler conditions look how i live i have a cable tv here we don't have electricity now but we're waiting for it to be switched on really there's a tv under a shelf with watermelons plus a couple of suitcases on the counter this is my kitchen here i cook of it mainly something fun he washes in this barrel but there is no water now as well as electricity so there is a candle on a shelf most probably from the church showering here is actually complicated in 2009 hugo chavez ex-president of venezuela forbade people from showering for more than three minutes there are people who need to wait for the water to heat up why what fall so they switch on water and let it run drinking water every minute of it is a criminal act one minute for soap one for shampoo one to finish up i counted three minutes and i don't stink until now you can't always get hot water and not everywhere and now five seconds for your friends to guess how much this man earns per month three dollars 30 130 or 300 you know i travel a lot and i visit many places which are not supposed to be for tourists and this is why sometimes i live in the conditions like this which are more or less the same to the guy that you just saw and sometimes i don't even have like three minutes like mr chavez for the shower and in this case the only way for me not to stink and to be clean and to be ready for anything in my trips is manscaped manscape created the world's first all-in-one manscaping kit that makes manscaping safe and easy to be

which lasts three minutes or less the owner of the shop is my brother my duties include security i help as an unskilled labourer a million bolivars is almost 300 which is a crazy amount salary for venezuela honestly i didn't even believe it at first but our guide assured us that this is a central fruit store and the numbers look real despite the crisis in this country there are almost all the biggest american chains for example wendy's i personally love burgers there better than in mackie d's or burger king shame wendy is closed in moscow there's also pizza hut and i'm not only talking about the capital for example here's a burger king in san cristobal a town with a population of hundred thousand people is on the border with colombia this is this yep there is literally no one here i really don't get how come this burger king operates at all one burger here costs around seven dollars so you can buy one and a half burger for a monthly pay there is not a single soul here and what's curious the kitchen doesn't work either it works somehow partially i mean i come and they promise that they will make me a burger at the same time they don't have any intermediate products for burgers like there are no buns no potatoes there's no salad for sale there he is the only person i saw in burger king except for us for three days that we've been staying in a hotel nearby and guess what he's eating what he brought with him in a container it appeared to be a local employee [Music] what's funny is they've actually built the ship for queuing they found it somewhere placed in order it's not that simple here in venezuela they spent money so please line up everyone a lunch for three people cost us around forty dollars thirteen dollars per person very expensive fast food in venezuela is generally very expensive for example my dinner at mcdonald's yes in order to stay chubby i eat dinner at mcdonald's always honest with you guys a combo with burger that looks like a classic big mac the original big mac was withdrawn from sales because it's impossible to produce it the central bun that separates two big mac meat patties this dinner costs 24 000 by three equals eight eight dollars let's see what kind of big mac that is um well you know it's okay i thought it could be a lot worse especially taking into account what i've been eating before in this wonderful country not bad at all very similar to a big man a big mac costs 14 000 bolivars if you buy it separately a bit more than three dollars venezuelan big man costs two times more than in russia as for the fries it's an interesting thing and it's really different why because it's not potatoes the thing is potatoes in venezuela are extremely expensive almost two dollars for a kilo dollar so the so-called fried potatoes are made of a root plant called yucca the taste is kind of similar of course you send something different but generally it's similar venezuelan mcdonald's once calculated that if they used real potatoes then one portion would cost 133 u.s it is generally impossible to understand the prices in venezuela for example in the lobby of our hotel one shot of whiskey costs 58 one shot not a bottle no surprise alcohol in the bars is protected even from staff by measuring tapes so that they don't over pour it or pour it off for resale it is more expensive to eat at the food court here than in a restaurant for example a venue attended by all the embassy employees it looks very expensive a piece of meat is around ten dollars at the entrance you were greeted by a bottle of vodka from roberto cavalli for a crazy 30 bucks three months salary there's also a sign asking to take your gun out before entering the restaurant before 2012 guns were sold here like mangoes literally on every street corner new laws allow only the sale of guns to military police or employees of the security services but since the adoption of the law the number of guns amongst the civil population has skyrocketed from three to almost six million most of the weapons of course end up in the arms of criminals venezuelan mafia clans network today looks as follows there are five types of gangs the first one is colectivos the guys on motorbikes they usually control the districts that are dangerous for ordinary policemen politically they are supporting the ruling regime the second type of gangs are the so-called pranays pranay is a slang word for a leader managing the gang from behind the bars they collect common money by robbing people on the streets as well as in the gold mining areas people there earn relatively well compared to the rest of the country the third gangs are the so-called las magabandus this is the most qualified gang they do not only do robbery but also securities fraud the fighters by the way have access to military weapons fourth type of gangs are paramilitaries half military organizations that operate at the border with colombia especially involved in smuggling the fifth gang are ex-members of the national liberation army they fight in the woods with tnt and rifles for the ideas of marx lemon and bolivar [Music] venezuelan favelas are called barrier which means district in spanish but the point is that these are the poorest areas literally slums they grew on the cheapest land in caracas hills and uplands till today only the poorest live here these are the areas where monthly salary barely reaches ten dollars so financially all is down that's how the locals meet up a shabby box with small gates where guys are playing football [Music] foreign [Music] basically barrio is a town with half a million people squeezed into the area of two or three districts of a typical russian city the higher you climb the narrower the streets are in some places paths turn into stairs the space for only a couple of people barrios started to form already in the first half of the 20th century after the fall of food prices from 1939 until today agriculture remains a financially unprofitable activity so the former farmers have nothing to do but to relocate closer to the city to get any job naturally there's never been any issue with permission to build huts one on top of another but nobody really asked people just look at the bricks and did the job that's how it looks inside no wallpaper stone walls painted at best cloth curtains instead of doors the rooms are tiny so there is space only for a bed basically wardrobes and dressers are not popular around here people just store things in plastic bags no heating thank god in venezuela the temperature rises up to 122 fahrenheit even in february holes in the walls don't seem to bother anyone either the roof is simply a steel sheet most importantly it must protect from rain and hold in place the wind here is really strong this woman's name is luisa anna gonzalia she is a dance teacher and a nail technician she earns 50 000 boulevards or 14 per month she received a flat in a new house closer to the city center under the resettlement program the hut is too small for three kids she still visits barrio often and is proud to have water and gas in the kitchen because when her father was building the house none of this was available we've built this house slowly brick by brick i wasn't born yet back then and now i'm already pushing 35. each barrio has its own beholder who reports that the seniors in his gang not to the police these laws are learnt here from childhood the easiest and maybe the only way to become rich in the barrier is to become a criminal folks don't really see any upward mobility nor chances to get legal income check this interview with one of the gang leaders well we do a little bit of everything drugs kidnapping stealing cars killing for money like hitting you know mostly drugs do you bother about the police no i have good contacts in my case life is better now than in the past but i reckon people of the city are having a hard time last year was the worst year in the history of venezuela i don't know why maybe it's the economy i've already mentioned that venezuela is one of the richest countries when it comes to oil and now three seconds for you to guess which plates venezuela holds in the top 10 list of countries with the biggest oil reserves is it the 10th the 7th the 5th or the 1st according to the world factbook by cia venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world there's more golden black liquid here than in saudi arabia that look like this also more than in russia but we can refrain from pictures here so what happened only 20 years ago the situation in venezuela was a lot better in 1999 maybe the most charismatic leader of the last century came to power hugo chavez his speeches were flamboyant and extravagant once he was holding the floor for 11 hours in a row imagine that at the same time chavez hated america and shook hands with everyone against the usa chavez was once pissed that they shared the same time zone with new york he literally said that venezuela had to refuse the time imposed by the imperial regime and turned venezuela's clocks back 30 minutes [Music] insane another time while giving a speech in the u.n he commented on george w bush who took the floor a day before he was in this very spot only yesterday it still smells like sulfur the turning point for the chavez government was in 2001 when oil prices started to grow he nationalized the industrial facilities so billions of dollars from oil sales started to flow to the country's budget instead of the us he issued food subsidies improved education and started to build the health care system which in turn led to a sharp drop of the poverty rate by more than a half these programs first really helped the poor strata but at the same time made people directly dependent on the oil prices it was clear that the programs couldn't go on if the prices were to fall it happened already after the death of chavez oil prices around the globe dropped almost two times in six months many countries entered the crisis and the government of venezuela couldn't do anything to fix the situation consequently the government couldn't cover the food subsidies for all of the poor who by that time composed 82 percent of the population with the broader store is it true that there's a limit in shops on how much one person can buy not only on the quantity of goods but also on the days when you can buy them when you come to the shop they check the final number of your id for example on monday one can buy food only if the last number is one or two tuesday is for those who have three or four and so on it happened to me several times i came to buy something and they wouldn't sell it to me because my id number ends with an a my day is friday so if you come on tuesday you can't buy anything only one day per week right right only one day per week people start to queue since 5am so many have to ask for leaves at work the government of several regions even legally forbid people from standing in the lines because it's not safe gives an impression of the city with endless lines people are cueing almost everyone from the mobile stores where people wait for half an hour an hour to top up their phone you can't do it on the internet or any other way the longest food line was filmed by the ap agency in january 2015 endless zigzags the typical queue is a bit shorter in order to get this shattered counter wrapped with duct tape yes nobody cares about replacing the glass people have to stand for hours even if i can't come on friday and i can't buy five kilos of food the rule says two kilos that's what i get what kind of products are you talking about namely i mean products under the government control the prices are controlled by the government it's rice pasta grits corn flour coffee sugar the main food products as i understand the prices are also limited yes that's why you can't buy it anyway speculators buy the products and resell them there behind the corner but it's 10 times more expensive a kilo of sugar costs 1.2 dollars for comparison a russian grocery store a kilo of sugar costs three times less pasta costs the same one dollar but you have to bring a bag to buy it so a kilo of sugar is 1.20 in russia it's 50 cents we flour costs one dollar in russia from 0.5 rubles and so on is it true that people are paying with food now for example for car park yes it's true yes prices have risen sharply can we talk about the deficit products in venezuela answer for yourself write me a comment meanwhile i will show you this situation the way it is here is a real empty shop with shabby shelves rotten fridge with empty bottles people still collect bottles here and deposit them the only food sold in the shop are green bananas at an unbelievable price of more than two dollars per kilo it's 20 percent of the salary imagine if a kilo of bananas in new york cost 850 dollars 10 minutes from here there is a big supermarket with security at the entrance here the shelves are stocked curious fact there is no sprite in venezuela it's called genato here there's no fanta it's a local hit coca-cola is sold but the word itself means basically any sweet sparkling beverage the word is denominative actually since nobody really cares about the copyright violations there is a lot of fake pepsi and coca-cola these beverages are not the same and taste horrible as for the real coke a two-liter bottle extremely expensive 2.70 25 of local salad honestly i thought the prices in russia are the fastest growing but it appears that's not really the case it's not that i'm so happy about comparison with venezuela but in 2018 prices here rose by 6 000 in a year at some point the government tried to follow the prices in 2012 there was formed an equitable price committee that was supposed to oversee the evil capitalist businessman and prevent unfair rip-off of the population maduro once got pissed that a dish washing machine cost eight thousand dollars so we sent the military to the shop who set the price 10 times lower people rushed to buy out the whole stock while such big players as general motors toyota and ford left the market but automobile and oil tycoons are next to nothing in venezuela compared to those who drum roll produce toilet paper no jokes really it is a pure luxury only affordable by the very rich one roll of toilet paper costs 21 000 if we divide that by three we will get seven dollars per such role for one month salary you can buy one such role 70 from the salary in new york this role would have cost 3 000 there is a meme in venezuela's social networks recently it also appears in ours the venezuelan military were awarded with toilet paper now i understand that it's not funny and it's actually true paper deficit in the country reached such a scale that the government extended all passport terms by two years because they simply didn't have enough paper or ink to print new ones in september 2013 the bbc reported that the national guard took by force a private paper cellulose factory to avoid the total deficit people save on paper even when it comes to napkins show the napkins it's like they cut a newspaper what is it even it's like the one used to print newspapers they just cut it you can't really use it you know i think even back in the ussr the paper we had was better adapted and to interact with skin this one is all glossy it doesn't soak anything up bit of a mockery eventually it got to the point where a rectangular piece of paper to print banknotes was more expensive than the banknote value it simply became unprofitable to print money especially taking into account the sky-high levels of inflation for example last year the inflation rate reached 1300 000 so the money was now easier to waive rather than to count this wad of cash was paid in summer 2018 for a whole chicken a bit less for a kilo of carrots that's a bunch to buy our favorite toiletries the government implemented currency redenomination and cut five zeros so a million bolivars turned into ten so today fewer banknotes are printed plus people started using debit cards still visa or mastercard are not accepted anywhere you'll hardly find a single place accepting cards out of the capital we had a day at the border when we couldn't eat at all because we ran out of local money and nobody accepted neither dollars in cash nor cards since then any shop accepting cards was a little bit of heaven for me if you pay by card you'll be asked to enter the number of your internal id at first we try to explain that we're foreigners and we don't have internal ids but eventually started to enter random seven digit numbers it's a lot easier before you leave the shop a special man will check your bag to make sure you've paid for all you have then he'll stamp your bill by the way paper bills are a sign of a rich shop there is a huge supermarket and not even haven't seen such even in some of our cities the system is usual you take fruit for example mango put it into a bag and then weigh it on a scale that looks like this naturally there are no stickers indicating weight one such paper sticker will be more expensive than all the mangoes i've picked as for meat you can buy it on the market here are some funny folks carrying half a cow there are no trolleys so they have to run around with 50 kilo carcasses on a shoulder in this section you can buy chicken rooster and attention pigeons sacrifice cults are very popular in venezuela and pigeons are used exactly for this purpose today the poor not only eat pigeons but even hunt the street animals here is a person carving most probably a cat [Music] at the same time you can't say that there is no meat in the shops please even a small shop has a fridge with a huge bulk of ham but the prices are crazy 37 bucks for a piece who could possibly buy it earning 10 dollars per month also every shop cafe and restaurant here has its own dollar rates set by the owner having dollars is complicated and if you arrive with only a card and without cash you are [ __ ] for lack of a better word you can withdraw only 1500 bolivars per day or 50 cents plus you have to survive in a line like this the thing is there is no such thing in venezuela as dollar rate there is an official rate the government at one point decided that one dollar must be equal to 10 bolivars but this rate is only available for those in the government officially to import medicine and food common people can't exchange dollars at all since 2013. since 2003 one has to obtain a permission from the government to exchange currency and only if the purpose is for travelling or study you have to gather a set of documents a return ticket confirmation of the purpose of stay this set is gathered following very strict rules up to the choice of boulder color you need to also have a credit card which here will take you about 3 years to obtain the card also has to be issued not less than six months before application a jury gathers and decides if you can exchange bolivars to dollars or not naturally these vouchers were resold which in turn spawned fraud and corruption there is a dollar black market that shows the real cost of bolivar it is hundreds of times less than the ones set by the government authenticity of dollar bank notes is strictly supervised for example if you pay cash when checking into a hotel your bank notes will be copied and you will be asked to sign the copy looks really funny if you give them fake money they will find you an exact retribution yeah sure dollar rate on the black market is obviously not coming from the central bank it's a separate world i don't understand what these people are thinking about the rate comes from the instagram accounts here is one of the most popular ones the rape fluctuates all the time and drastically [Music] which is now you finally understand why the bolivar dollar rate is such a mess and now the promised contest we don't have any super prizes beamers or mercs but at least all is fair this is what i brought from this amazing country by the way i was supposed to bring a box of fruit from venezuela papaya mango stuff like that it's been around two or three months already aeroflot it's not that i dreamed to share these fruits with you i'm just curious how it will look like after three months plus 40. back to business the first place prize is a collection bottle of rum in a beautiful tissue bag by the way it's that rum that was carefully supervised with help of a measuring tape the second prize is a one bolivar coin it's a really unique prize it's basically one ten thousandth of a dollar you can hardly find one today even in venezuela i've mentioned they're using cards now at all so the third place prize is this bracelet in venezuelan colors with as for the task people the task is to guess as precisely as possible the rate of bolivar to dollar exactly in two weeks we will take the figures from the real instagram page here it is namely from the top stock the air tm we will take the figures posted at 2pm venezuela time pay attention to the name of this instagram page because there are fake accounts the one we need is spelled as one word and the page has a million subscribers so don't confuse them and subscribe to this channel right now to stay updated on future videos and of course on the contest results moving on there is a place in caracas called basically the upper east side rich area there is an area with a large number of extremely expensive houses we were just driving by and every house has a huge fence just like in russia here we also find huge really massive golf courses and see they are not empty unlike shelves in the shops you know the problem is that there's no middle class there are many poor people here i can say that there aren't too many these people are stinking corruption in venezuela is unbelievable in order to get a passport a place in a kindergarten and so on you have to know someone who knows someone who's friends with someone that's the price list my bloomberg colleagues got on whatsapp five hundred dollars to get a passport in two days four hundred bucks for a chilean visa from five to seven thousand to delete a criminal record a hundred for a stamp providing college diplomas corruption erodes even the most important parts of the system built by chavez people line up to get a food package from the government i don't know it depends these packages cost 10 20 30 times cheaper than the shops you mean cheaper than the speculator's price yes yes for example last time the price of a package with milk butter pasta grits sugar and coffee was around three or 3500 bolivars one dollar yeah yes the problem is these free food packages reach fewer and fewer people each year that's why communist venezuelans have long been using the capitalist system to make money generally despite the anti-american course of the government people are quite loyal towards the us the daughter of chavez himself happily took selfies with justin bieber here's a guy on the street with a meat grinder he will grind you as much coffee as you need street vendors sell what they can get not what's in demand here's a man with a thermos who sells hot tea another one sells cigarettes 200 bolivars each he sits here for hours and even at lunch time some guys like to chill play chess and drink tea the perfect job is a taxi driver there is an army of them here you can both chill between the rides and make some cash [Music] here we are in a venezuelan taxi next to me is the driver who looks like he's about 70. he has a fantastic mirror i'm not 100 sure what he's talking about all venezuelan taxis are equipped with cameras look there really is a camera most probably it doesn't work it monitors the cabin doesn't monitor [ __ ] and registers the fare of the driver all money is siphoned off there is a radio here and the taxi meter that doesn't work for some reason really why would it the point is that maduro the acting president is trying to win more votes among taxi drivers he started to give cars a discount price so the drivers could work but under the condition that the fare would be socialistically small they didn't quite observe that but generally somehow it works if you have a pickup truck but still want to work as a taxi driver you're welcome here are six people packed into the back of a pickup standard practice here's a guy riding in an office chair our taxi driver for example got a flat tire but he doesn't think about going for a service is finishing the ride there are expensive cars in the city they are kept behind tall fences with barbed wire most of the cars in the streets are old shabby rattle traps i saw two cars with a muffler literally dragging on the ground behind and the drivers just kept on going doesn't look like it suddenly fell off it's just normal to drive that way anyone who can get any car is a taxi driver people torment their cars until they fall apart [Music] look we're at a gas station gas costs six bolivars per liter full tank around the museum cheap petrol is kind of a socialist achievement since oil is national so if you forgot to take your wallet you can just come and ask to fill the tank for free most probably you won't be denied oh and on the one hand it's wonderful on the other despite enormous amounts of oil in the country its production is rapidly going down because it requires technology financing and so on locals don't usually allow taxi rides so they use buses it's also almost free bus ticket cost 100 we paid 100 didn't we no matter where you go right so you pay 100 bolivars and go anywhere you need no not to another country it's 1 13 of a dollar around 3 cents that's how the bus looks there's no air conditioning of course the seats are fine quite comfortable the door is always open because people are constantly jumping right to the bus so it sometimes doesn't even stop just slows down they jump on and the bus moves up today the streets of caracas are packed only in case of protests or during the carnival [Music] venezuelan carnival is similar to our pancake week and the beginning of great lent children and some adults dress up paint faces and go for a walk if we turn a blind eye to the public disorder the carnival ended with this year it's generally safe in the city at this time criminally speaking [Music] carnival is classic for latin america but i should say that the venezuelan one is very different from jesus someone just threw confetti right into my mouth it's probably from the ground see all the floor is covered with these confetti well not much you can do brewing confetti is a venezuelan tradition only there usually isn't money to buy new bags that's how it's done and then they kick the confetti around again it's made of some really hard cardboard usually you're just walking the street someone jumps up pats you on the back and throws a whole bunch of those things right into your face when you turn around well those who throw it have fun yeah but honestly it's not so pleasant still the atmosphere is generally very good [Music] actually till 2013 venezuela hosted lots of tourists and before that many people were dreaming to get here and not only from latin america but also from the us things in venezuela were so good that at one point they became the biggest consumers of whiskey in the world and in the second half of the 70s the country was the richest on the continent due to the income from oil sales [Music] that's how a free city beach looks like now it's a beach in caracas the saddest part is the infrastructure here is basically absent the shore itself is quite clean apparently because the waters somehow managed to wash away all this stuff that's the only infrastructure you'll find here there are the remains of canopies there's one remaining there well and before people could lie and relax in the shade there are no changing rooms so people change in the bushes i'll turn now so you can see how people change they just go to the side and do their thing that's the whole beach infrastructure honestly instead of coming here for a holiday i'd rather go to samara there's a good beach there i'm from samara so please come it's a great city at the same time venezuela has fancy resorts especially on the islands that look luxurious like the maldives but the prices are so high that these resorts are affordable only to the guys from the gulf fields common people just can't afford it they most likely have never even heard that such places exist [Music] all this is extremely sad because venezuela has an unbelievable potential for tourism the world's highest waterfall for example is right here if you thought that it's niagara falls which we'll cover soon in another video so please subscribe now then you're wrong angel falls is one kilometer high water is sprayed out in tiny bits that form fog i will leave a link in the description where the waterfall is shot in 360 8k format highly recommended oh the waterfall is in deep jungle and you can only reach it by boat or by plane there isn't a single tree here that hasn't been struck by one of the frequent lightning storms another breath taking place is roraima it looks like a shot from a sci-fi movie it's also known as the tabletop mountain of te pais it is part of a big plateau that formed 200 million years ago when america and africa were one continent rarima was inaccessible for people for many years only the bravest from the indian tribes sneaked from time to time to what they believed was the sacred terrain there is a legend about a local loch ness monster it's called cavarosaurus witnesses often describe a cabraosaurus as a huge snake with a prolonged body five to thirty meters long with the head of a horse or a camel that's how the remains of a karborosaurus look though later it was discovered that it was a shark which used to be so you sit peacefully and suddenly the electricity is off in the next episode i will show you how the most dangerous country lives in complete darkness we're actively told to sit in the car like it's dangerous what happens on the streets at night when the city centre is empty it's the first time that electricity was shut down in the whole country can you imagine what it is to switch off electricity for example in the whole of russia how many days can you survive if there's no water or electricity in a flat all water pumps are also electric we could hear gunshots all night long god knows what kind of gunfight it was what happens at the venezuelan border how families cross the forward by foot while others protest against the government and the police let's go back i think it's really dangerous they burn that truck that's still on the bridge how does it feel like to fly from a power down airport it's like a sauna blood sweat and tears there will be a protest or a breakthrough because people have already been queueing for hours and by looking at this line they'll be standing here for another 20. this is our new format please subscribe to my channel press like take part in the contest here you will see how people live [Music] you", "ZGLdC32jxBc": "another bus reveals the THC vaping operation but this time in Milwaukee police say a search warrant revealed nearly a million dollars in cash thousands of THC vape cartridges and close to 18 pounds of marijuana prosecutors allege it was all going on in this neighborhood near 51st and Howard Mary Jo Ola explains what else investigators found inside nearly a week ago law enforcement swarmed this home on Norwich Court near 51st and Howard on Milwaukee's south side just squads all over the place a neighbor says his wife sent him this picture they're all lined up on down the streets and we didn't know what was going on because there was never no action going on by the house that they rated as police served a search warrant they arrested Giovanni Molina and Amanda where they're accused of running a drug operation involving marijuana THC vape cartridges and edibles with THC there are pretty cool people just you know drive by say hi wave how you doing nothing going on investigators say Molina and where appeared to be living at the home a criminal complaint illustrates what authorities found including close to 18 pounds of marijuana two grey plastic storage totes each with nearly half a million dollars in cash were found in a bedroom closet in the garage they uncovered more than 13,000 vape cartridges and edibles with THC the THC cartridges had labels like dank and King pen there was also a loaded handgun police say it's notable considering the amount

[Music] so [Music] [Music] you", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "E23eThJHapk": "guys welcome back it's tony here from vape thing always mega store um today i have something different for you we are going to be doing um mtl juices um from prime's range and we're going to be doing those juices on the best possible device for it which is the lux vm 40 from vaporesso okay let's do it first let me tell you a bit about the juices this is prime's wrath of the grape mtl juice it is a sour grape flavor and it's absolutely delicious i won't be doing a finger taste on it because it is a 12 milligram and yeah the other one we have here is mango to the max also 12 milligram and this would be similar to a um a ripe mango that you can just jump into on on a hot summer's day both of these do contain a little bit of ice so yeah all right let's do the box the luxe bm40 i already have one of these but i love it so much i want to show everyone um this color is known as the j color and uh yeah it's gonna live up to expectation let's see let's see what's in the box all right firstly yes couple of user manuals in here i don't need that um it's got a usbc charger again it's a more accurate charge it's faster charging as well okay right off in the box you can see two coils going in and there are two parts and that is why i'm going to be doing two juices because this device allows you to do two different juices if you want a different flavor in each all right a closer look at the device itself five clicks to switch it on one two three four five it's got adjustable airflow as well i do like it open if you like it more restricted close your airflow all right there we go so as you can see it's got a maximum of 40 watts the range is from 5 watts to 40 watts if i press this three times i'll be able to set it manually but uh vaporesso has made this so special with the smart mode on your is that you don't need to set it because if you use a 0.8 coil or it'll automatically detect it for you and if you use a 0.6 ohm coil it'll automatically detect that as all right so i've been vaping mango mtl for quite some time and i actually love this flavor in the 0.6 ohm so i'm going to be setting this one up with a 0.6 and the wrath of the grapes will be going with a 0.8 version all right so first quail now priming the quill is very easy it's five drops down the center see one two three four five and it just slides in here any way you want it to it'll work either way all right then to fill it up we are just going to open the pot it's very simple you can do this while it's installed on the pod or if you take it off you'll see a little rubber on this side this is anti-leak it just fits right in there and then you can fill it up there's a maximum line so don't fill it over that line and there we go now i'm going to show you a close-up of when i actually put this in when i put the uh the pod in the device it's currently set on 22 watts but i know this pod this coil can run a bit higher so once i put it in that 26 watts automatically all right you can see on yeah i've got 85 battery power it detects the coil as a 0.6 and there we go just underneath that is a little buff counter as well all right let's try it out 12 milligram prime i know what this tastes like it's amazing oh what a hit i love it ntl gives you a hit in your throat um it's not as much nicotine as what salts is but it does give you a more satisfactory hit all right one more it's not too icy and it's such a sweet flavor i love it it's delicious it really is i've literally been vaping this for years all right let's do the other one okay then the next one we're going to do is of course the wrath of the grave now i am very set in my way so i love the manga so this is a treat for me i've never tried this 0.8 ohm coil for a bit more restriction five drops down the center one two three four five and this also just slides in anyway there's no dif no wrong way of doing it open it up fill up your pod and bam we are ready again i'm going to do a close-up to show you how the smart function works on yeah again currently it's on 26 because the last coil it detected was the 0.6 now the 0.8 cannot run at 26 watts and it needs a bit lower watts so it automatically jumps back to 18. they just did this this is the easy way here's the other part again 0.6 bam it's there and i want to switch back 18 watts all right let's try this oh much less of a throat tip that's delicious that is that is a whole lot of grape right there and i'm getting a sour sour taste on my tongue as you can see it can handle quite a big pool as well this is still 12 milligram nicotine even though it doesn't hit as hard as the mango in the throat i'm still getting the nicotine in i can't do this too much yeah importance of having this smart function on you is that if you are switching between a 0.8 and a 0.6 ohm coil it won't just burn your coil out it will just run it where it's optimally designed for right sure that's all from us and we'll see you next wednesday", "CbgwalEUP_E": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] Seiler bought the [ __ ] flex your life we got the rad cartridge the homie Quinn was able to provide this that's why you see it's already kind of used I didn't expect to be doing that you today a nice leave some we're actually going to be using his battery as well not a very good one but I would have brought my pocket if I knew that you were brought this but let's release how do you yeah it was already open right yeah so push through release and then you close right first to release come on dude get it done so I already got all the stuff in the intro I already filmed it so I don't need plastic or metal for after the party lemon laser oh where I like got in the nose but it makes it it yeah yeah you got that for you well no then it sometimes though it's very obviously it tastes like lemon but not too too sweet not too sour I like the sweetness of the lemon it tastes like una dama de yeah but it is sweet though it's pretty good that's really good living but not weight limit heads yes like a sweet lemon not the shouts our part no sweet lemon has those hard candies exactly that's how the Stars with so I'm gonna just assume that this is distillate don't different doesn't really say on here at all honestly I'm gonna just say it's this delay just because it's a very clear like liquid and just so it's usually like light lighter color and it's a it's artificial taste like it's not like I mean it's lemon you can't be lemon terms but yeah it's not I don't think it's weird I just just reminds me of that sweet lemon heads but it is pretty enjoyable for twenty-five dollars half a gram I would recommend it to people that like the logo wears that's definitely not bad though yes rag I see I know I don't know if anyone has exactly told me to like try this but you know it's a cartridge you might as well review it what do you prefer I would you rate it it's not good pretty good I I felt like it wasn't really getting like the full potential of it with my battery that could be told I was about to say that too just like this bag yeah is because it works better on the white one I don't know well this one doesn't have variable voltage it just has one bolt one setting okay let me just take one more hit and then you know he's always I like so it says for 416 milligrams of THC so the THC some percentage showing about 83% 83.2% I got it earlier I couldn't get it right there but I got earlier well yeah that's it for the video hope you guys enjoyed this video red cartridge 30 bucks so they recommended me this wasn't it wasn't it good for the recommendation okay I want to see so what was it good for the recommendation I like what I tell I tell the people nice I'm going to tell them you know how you like to try new things it's a gamble right is it money about shitty you know right I didn't like the fortunately business sometimes it's not easy to just buy new things yes because I don't want to end up with a shitty product oh you gotta try something to try it so I've got a tester pride [Music] [Music]", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys

without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in the bathroom man that [ __ ] was [ __ ] had me loading man thank you guys for um being in my premiere because i premiered and i was in the chat talking to a bunch of people that were watching my video so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments

see you next time", "hOwNPZIX-k8": "hi guys welcome back to episode 52 of the raid series in the previous episode we did a couple runs for the setup slash silent caliber quest got him and also we went into a night right on customs to get the uh taco shooter putt i've done which we were lucky enough to get a uh a shooter board and heaven headshot too that should be 100 meter headshot in this episode i want to continue on that same quest line i want to try and get the talk of shooter quest done i've seen there's only two more kills and also we need to get these shotgun kills done so um yeah if we we have a bit of a smooth action today so guys without further ado let's crack straight into it [Music] all right so as it goes um so far we only need two more of the chunk of shooter kills to get the uh quest done right so if it's between 2100 and 05 it is we'll probably go for that first um and the reason behind that is we are only 29 000 xp away from leveling uh it's level 40 and this quest gives 20 000 xp so big easy win there um on top of that we have some stuff to do for here we have no room in the stash let's get these two bitcoins and just assume that i'm always trying to uh top up the big the uh the fuel and and stuff in the hideout and i'll collect the bitcoins even if i'm not like filming that day so you're not going to see imagery of that god knowing that in it i'll put that there for now cool uh empty we could make a mag box if we really wanted to another one and this gets so expensive three of these and we're good to go oh we'll put the um we'll put the other fuel that's left in that and the two middle ones with the cell well bitcoins dropped in price quite a bit you come down here into there um and a money case would be actually quite nice wouldn't it what we can do it's just a very very simple cheap fix we'll just grab two wallets it just tidies it up that little bit um every 20 get put away for now damn oh you know boy but this moonshine we can put down in here um let's see how we go i might be able to might be able to get some quest to hand in not question marks and stuff to hand in or claim the uh the moonshines and stuff so oh we also have an insurance return to get as well that i saw [Music] um i've already got one of them ready to go wait there we do need to get another presser though all right um let's see if we can get the moonshine claimed we can start another one [Music] oh must be a backpack or something [Music] sure that's gonna get work now oh has to be a backpack then [Music] um i don't know what else i can do um okay uh we haven't got the heart at upgrade yet um so hello first in the now i guess [Music] we sell they right if that doesn't work now then we'll stop [Music] the favorite stuff from that and rollers were heaps as well are we gonna put on the moonshine out there into the universe um it's saying that we need to hand in a rolf request is it living high [Music] we don't need to do this for for the for it so i might just sell this wow big money um the lupo's beans we should already have we can hold on to that for now um cool we can sell that [Music] i can put stuff in that backpack i'll just try to avoid it right now all right so i think we're gonna go another night time rate just to get this quest done besides that though pretty sweet roller sold gets us up to seven and a half we're not far away from uh doing this dash upgrade which would just be kind of nice to get done uh another million uh i did buy that fuel didn't i oh we can re we can buy another one now if we wanted to there was room i might just get that just so we've got uh plenty of fuel moving forward what it would be nice to do get rid of that one all right and let's go so customs gonna get a couple of scav kills maybe trying to get a shooter in heaven if it's we're lucky enough for the night time and should be good all right let's do it all we need is two scav kills if we can get a cheeky plane kill at the same time that'd be great but it's not requirement there's a pretty good chance players will spawn at the end up ahead so we can just get up to here and stop for a minute and just take it take a second i'll have a listen before pushing forward ideally we just get two scav kills and we just have fun from there in a perfect world so i think if i sit down in the shadows down here a little bit as long as no one's using a thermal oh look how clear it is it's beautiful beautiful weather i kind of just want to wait a minute just to okay skeptic can spawn in here during this next bit so we just be patient might see someone cross not super kind of just sprinting straight across and just getting clapped i would say up there would be about 150 if we wanted to zero a little bit quieter at the moment hmm i'm gonna push up like i said i object to get the two cap kills than anything else after that's a bonus let me just go around the back here a little bit stay out of the direction that's maybe dorms um yeah that's probably dorms that sounds like a scav doing that i'll go one to go i'm feeling comfort this is a scav yeah that turn there what can check backpack real quick all right what i'm going to do from here is i'm going to get to the position where i can watch dorms from the road maybe someone go on the roof and we can try and snipe them so our aim is to shoot unless they come out on the roof but it was shooting there super quite raid this can work quite well for the shooter born in heaven sometimes even come through into these rooms too we can keep moving though someone flicked the power for zb013 so we could just go stronghold we want to there's two we killed one i'm gonna try and get up on top of this uh on top of this uh building on top of construction see if i take the shot from there don't think he knows where i am now which is good this three and they were right on top of that it has to be three because i saw it has to be three because i saw one and he was moving and not shooting so well i'm as i'm having just to toss it hmm unfortunately i don't really know where they are now they could have pushed up making a lot of noise here i could push that towards destruction this really comes down now if they just loot their mate's body and just start getting out i really want to push towards them i might have killed him in a right angle that i could potentially hit from the side this is where i should have ran to straight away fairly confident they would have moved on by now we'll just go around there's not going to be any loot left on him and if there is then they're covering the body and i'm dead when i get there i think they've gone though i think they would have grabbed everything yeah yeah no point focusing on that anymore [Applause] [Music] i'm bleeding really there's someone running up then gonna keep moving we can check old gas for building their extract hmm okay someone was gonna chase me up through the door not like it looks like a person there it's not let's put the next airstrikes open though so we'll take that we'll get out i complain though a little ride i don't have to deal with it i don't really want the lpsqc hmo and got some more points in sniping so no complaints here 51-70 i think it was a three-man so happy to get that kill 3300 xp um as for the part thing we pretty much ran um straight up waited for see if anyone was crossing over or not then we pushed out killed some scabs after this guys were done we could be a little more flamboyant with our plays and um we i was covering the the dorms because we heard some shooting over there but the place coming up from stronghold or gold tour i like to call it uh killed one and then there was two more that were trying to shoot me and i just had to keep flanking until i got to a position where i could shoot him couldn't get him so i left the right side pretty straightforward right there um heal up now with that quest handed him we are like 4000 xp away from level 40 uh where we get a thick weapon case which will just clean up our stash a bit so looking forward to that uh and also gives us right round level four and uh mechanic level four which means we can get some of the uh items that we might want to want or might want to use or you know play in the game ah so yeah you're gonna hand that quest in i tackle shooter now for part six you have to kill snipe scabs we can do that on shoreline so um if we want to do a shoreline quest or two now we could um but what i want to do instead is i want to keep working on getting [Music] um setup done so for this ap 20s in shotguns and quite brutal but we'll make do [Music] i'm gonna need more meds now see we'll get that one in here so we're good here i'll take that just in case snb ammo there [Music] pretty happy with that um let me just sell that now this one's quite a brutal quest because like we said we're gonna get the pmc kills using the shotguns it it can be a little bit hit and miss but if we play smart sometimes you get three or four kills to raid sometimes you don't get any at all because you just get smacked by the first person you see so um don't call about where three or ten once we get someone called we're done we can take away the uh suppressor and then set up we're at 315 so we'll keep plotting on try and get a few more of them and see how we go i've had a bit of fun doing it um i always want to try and take some grenades from now on if possible too though i don't have a grenade box though of stuck right all right into the way we go customs this is daytime from now on let's go right so depending on our supporters how we approach this we're just gonna go back into this all right this is always sketch very good chance we'll die here [Applause] hoping i can see them before they see me saw someone up there i'm not like in there it's gonna push into here sorry guy running around there sorry about running left to right near the train i don't know if he's camping down the bottom of it let's try and move to some lower ground [Music] hmm [Applause] don't know where he went probably crossed over a lot of shooting i tried third party it effected it was the last one shooting so let me get up this hill go go well when it gets stamina back up i didn't hear this guy getting shot at i'm trying to listen out for any sort of movement somewhere we could pounce on it as quickly as possible all right so kind of want to go towards dorms here i see someone might be above me please oh me all right we're not going that way am i just hitting the bush up here for a minute we'll progress once we hear some gunshots it's a flashbang here he's comes holy that goes going if you missed it maybe frankie would have been nice enough to give a little bit of a zoom cam or some uh it sounded like a 338 to me or an svd or something maybe a little bit more cautious i don't know what to do from here more going to move towards that juice caps here i think that shot was it um at all gas that shot we heard shooting i see us lay one all right we'll take this keep on moving alright he's dead hmm oh god ram sells for a little bit at the moment she had bpmr take it gives you a cell for a little bit of times all right i think we can reset we'll just keep progressing through kill some scams and then reset i feel like a lot of the fighting's probably already over i don't really want to go into dawns of the shotgun well it can work sometimes in their favor i feel like it's just it's someone's got like a vector or any sort of like a ham for even just aks it's really hard because they can just full auto you've literally just got to go like you just got to try and get one one or two clean hits you got to kill someone whereas they can just push you a second you like miss your shot um whereas it's kind of if you had if we were using bug shot maybe we could do it that way all right so two scabs one player um but yeah if we're using bug shots i think it'd be probably better to go dawn but with the ab 20 it's just not much room for error we'll see where we go in the next next ride um for the party for that was pretty straightforward we just went straight back into uh things called trailer park extract check the play there wasn't there we pushed up across the construction um kind of went towards dawn's but didn't go in there and then through stronghold old gas kill to play there and out nothing too special crazy for that raid um oh right put that in there i think we actually got the water filter going we not there we go now we have another um chip for now i'll just put all this in here you can sell it later btmo you know i think i need to really put somewhere is that oh and then we'll take this off put that there and then sell that cool ready to go again all right let's do it all right so something i didn't really touch on on the last raid was about how i heard the shot at you guys they start old gas and i was like all right let's get over there and do something about it so um typically sounded like someone was fighting scavs that's the kind of stuff that i try and take advantage of as much as possible so getting myself in a position i think right someone's in the middle of doing something let's try and just try and capitalize on that situation so it's gonna turn the power i like turning the power on like i know a lot of people don't for some reason but i like to get on because it gives me an option to extract all right um the memes let's open this up what i'm thinking something a little bit different is i'm actually going to push to the other side of construction and try and get people to run across instead of pushing towards dorms i'm going to try and cut people off as they're coming up the hill and stuff a bit of a different path i haven't really tried this before so as they're coming up towards construction method i could do which i haven't tried before go this way so the games here is trying to kill people as they run across the land bridge this one we get that p90x on place i want to get to is behind this osteppo all right so we want to try and get him right when he jumps over i think that's just kind of [Music] [Applause] foreign  off oh extracted i didn't mean to extract we got another player we've got two actually that's that's a win that's a big win two more players um we played that really well so what the objective there was to push out and try and get people as they're coming towards you i used to do this strategy a lot uh early tackle of days where um if i got the bridge spawn for example i'd run straight to the other side of dorms and then kill everyone as they're coming towards dorms because they assume there's no one else in front of him right and uh it worked really well this is before the expansions and that on customs where there was a stronghold and also the um the i don't know that back area so what i do is i push straight across towards new gas so i'd get the bridge spawn to push towards new gas and in between that and dorms and everyone had to come through me to get towards the other side of the map to extract so then i would just fight everyone there it works really well um i just tried that strategy again just there so i pushed across the guy was coming across towards the uh crack house we got him pretty clean easy kill there and then there was the other guy that was shot up um so i'm pretty sure i hit that first dude and killed him one hit i might have counted this two that second guy took eight hits so i hit him a lot i think i must have just kept hitting the limbs and stuff parting's pretty straightforward on what i did though so um a couple more kills and uh no complaints here so i think that was that three more pmc kills towards uh stolen caliber and also set up so happy days there um hmm i think that's gonna have to be it for this episode i don't really have time to do another raid uh i didn't mean to extract then i was just gonna kill the scav and then head across um towards customs area uh with a big red boss and try and fight the next guy but i accidentally um accidentally uh left to right that's okay these things happen um not a big deal but at least uh let's put that win under our belt i wouldn't i would really like to get uh the next level so we could um get the the weapon case and start moving on with that but hey look these things happen literally like one more raid what are we at with 1700 xp away so um set up six of 15 and uh don't call was six or ten so slowly progressing along didn't get any deaths this episode as well which is quite nice um we could just do an interchange run next episode or maybe go to shoreline to get some of this other stuff done uh and it wouldn't hurt a couple of snipers on shoreline to repair that food and drink um used about that much [Music] and i think we're good i think we're good yeah as for uh this episode that is it switch these around that way i can reload this and then pop up cool uh yeah so hopefully you guys enjoyed this episode we pvp focused which was cool obviously we had the uh the snaps at the start but yeah um we're trying to get some pvp happening and uh i will do analysis when i feel like it's needed if we do like really sick plays and stuff i'll do analysis but but now it's like um let's focus on getting some pvp action is we've got the grenadier quest we've got these shotgun kills we also have um all the grenade kills we're gonna have to do which is gonna be a frustrating situation so let's just get these uh shotguns and and and that done first and then we'll work on getting those grenades done um and yeah we'll go from there but well as this episode that is it hopefully you guys enjoyed it smash share like button comment for

can send those videos over to eric whatever guys shop.com or whatever guys shop at gmail.com or the whatever guy handyman at gmail.com all right so moving on from that as you guys know today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly rap is designed for this is a really good car like i said you guys can contact teddy vapes over at 5026 vaughn road in montgomery alabama the phone number is 334-398-8691 you guys give him a call see what he's about and have that and tell that dude that you saw his uh reviews on the whatever channel on the whatever guy and that you want a code of whatever to get some percentage off when you walk in that store down there or possibly um get to the point like i said i've got this uh cush in this diesel and i will tell you this the kush is a really good because i've already had some of my pipe i'll do a review on it either tomorrow the next day these are really good delta eight infused uh hip flower i told you before um i this i probably rank this right up there with the moon rocks of uh hometown heroes so we'll talk about that later on i didn't open up the um the diesel yet but uh because i wanted to wait for the end but i couldn't wait to do the kush um so i'll talk to you guys about that probably tomorrow hey folks it's tuesday it's whatever guys signing off i told you guys to stick around the end i'll tell you how you can win yourself a brand new bottle of these nasa softgels from over at leafystock.com don't forget you can go to leafystock.com use code whatever to get these soft drills all day long for 20 off but borrowing that on cinco de mayo uh we're going to be giving away one of these nasa delta eight soft gels 15 milligram there's 50 in a bottle beginners ray on may 5th hey folks whatever got signed off because whatever me i hope everybody's having a great week see ya", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "BQgkVTCGKAg": "[Music] oh man got a full house alright sorry guys what's up sausage gravy biscuit glad grower forgot my ashtray got burned down with you guys make it some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "taMoxmzEcjw": "SATISFIED WITH WAITING IN THE\nPOURING RAIN FOR TICKETS. >> IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT\nOPERATION WAS HAPPENING NEXT\nDOOR.

myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "8lxTLkdniLc": "[Music] we just got these in surplus carts they are one whole gram of concentrate oil it is very good oil 2 for $50 out the door football tax including one thing that's nice about these sort of you guys check out yet we also carry a carts driven oh there's one right there 25 for a half gram 45 for a whole gram on the driven carts they come in five different varieties and they were very good they're all and they're tested in the eighty percent surplus they're testing the eighties this one they do indica sativa hybrid this one is the indica it's blackberry cush and its tasted testing at eighty one and a half two whole gram that oil is very clear this oil it looks very similar to likes a heavy hitter will also talk about heavy hitters the hardware that surplus users now on their carts is exactly the same hardware as heavy hitters used so it's a good high quality very low fell rate with a green metal top so the blackberry cush values okay good these have a lot of Turks in them this was the create by the driven that one this is also fairly good if you want to try that one have to smells good supposedly excited turbine they're great on price $50 for whole gram once again indica sativa hybrid that ones as flavor Bowl is like a malibu OG from heavy hitters who tried that one was a really good flavor it kind of reminds me of that a little bit i mean different taste but like kind of a sweet cush like that they're both google call it quality parts for a great price the surplus it looks like the clarity the oil is a little clear oil and the turbines clear - just slightly darker like a honey the surplus is like good like a cooking oil color as summer time gets here in your car try not to keep your carts or your brake pins and your car when it gets really hot because you might find out when you come back to my league is tendencies when it in excessive heat and cars have any before left and a new glove box or you know cup holder or something and it's a sitting in the Sun and Bates and it leaks it makes a big mess so you don't want that so keep storing up correctly and you won't have a problem and even at home a lot of times just take your card out while you're charging your battery just it keeps it from firing accidentally was charging and burning at her quell some don't have any problem with that but some do if you end up coming back to your cart and checking on it and may not work where I just may not taste as good that could be a reason why so check this out our website green gold cultivators ink.com give us a call

sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm

instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "ZIPLMpaH-JI": "want to do like some I've not just I don't know if you guys I'm pretty sure you guys have had select cartridges before I've no they were just me if I'm just tripping but honestly like to meet all of these cartridges they kind of taste us safe so yeah they kind of have like a strong hashey taste to it some of them's up so I have I got this one for like around $35 here to attack so it's a citrus SAP you know I grabbed the citrus top because it sound like I had it you know it was like fruity so we're gonna see we're gonna see how what it tastes like you know if it's like really fruity or is it just hashey you know like the rest of them so let me know if you guys know too you know like I'm talking about if you guys have select cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges so I mean don't get me wrong these are pretty far you know they're still good the quality of all it was pretty good so I had done this for like 35 bucks you guys want to see the back full grams so so yeah let me know what you guys doing on this Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know I'm trying to get this Vito before it gets darker so you go ahead and put the button push the pushing the button but let me know if you guys [ __ ] with these stuff you guys you know these stone you guys this list some people say no some people say yeah but I don't really care you know these cartridges are still pretty good so you gonna pop it open you're gonna get a nice little seesaw cartridge I like these right here these [ __ ] rip you know out of all the cartridges they have you know there's some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you guys are [ __ ] awesome I'm just trying my best to like bring keep bringing our content [ __ ] for you guys you know

church buddy icon from the other cartridges it's pretty good you know it's a big big [ __ ] paddy and they [ __ ] rip so we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I haven't done one yet but I will soon I'm I just haven't got the time yet so I'll probably do that tomorrow you know get out of work something and yeah guys I'm going to hit this again for you guys well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "iYW3J0AD9MM": "how much delta a should i take if you ever ask yourself that i'm going to be answering that question for you in this video maybe not fully because it really does like vary per person but i'm going to talk about in general like how much delta should you take for certain desired effects normally in my videos i'd be vaping a delta eight cars open but for this video i don't have any delta eight cards because i'm all out so so i'm gonna be vaping a clarity instead because it's like four in the morning and i want to go to sleep after this or shortly after this so it makes sense gotta have some trouble smoking the video you know can be a dang frank video with no smoke what i mean they can't because my shorts last tick tocks some thomas might have smoke in it because if i because if i blow clive they'll say on tick tock i'll get the video taken down if you're taking delta edibles i recommend starting off with 25 milligrams most daily gummies i see is typically dose at 25 milligrams so i would just assume if most companies dose these gummies at 25 milligrams it's probably four reasons probably because that's like a decent amount for like just a little show effect everyone racks yourself differently plus tolerance exists so 25 milligrams so one person may not be that much better another person might be a d like a good amount if you're worried that 25 milligrams may be a little bit too much for you then i recommend cutting that gummy in half or only in half of it and that would be like 12 and a half milligrams and you may not be feeling a whole lot because for me personally when i eat 25 milligrams i don't even feel a whole lot so i feel like if i ate half of that i really would be feeling a whole bunch but that's just me you know everyone is different for me personally i like to take around 50 milligrams every time i use silty edibles because for me that's definitely a decent amount because whenever i eat 50 milligrams of delicious bowls like i'm definitely feeling high like sometimes if i eat like 25 milligrams i mean of course i'm already feeling like a little high but like when you like 25 milligrams it may be like just like just a little high but like with 50 milligrams it's like i'm high you know like i don't know if you know what i mean but like i feel like you might when i get to higher doses just like a hush milligrams or over it that's when i'm like uh i i may fall asleep you know after just a couple hours because it would definitely make me like a little bit tired and just because i ate a hundred milligrams of delta thc does not mean i have to go to sleep and being that high may entice me to take a little nap and everything i'm saying about eyeballs can pretty much be applied to tinctures too i never used the delta e texture before i've used a cbd tincture before but i never used a delta a texture before but if you don't know what these tinctures are this is just all that you can put under your tongue it's like a little dropper that you like you take off the caps a little dropper right here put it under your tongue like sit there for like 30 seconds and you just swallow the rest of the older the distinctions just like this with delta a and i'm pretty sure will give you similar effects to those variables but in a quicker amount of time because since it's absorbed under your tongue it absorbs pretty quickly almost as quickly as you smoke and you're vaping it don't know if it's like just as fast or faster but pretty much around the same time frame it would be you know relatively fast and because i've never used a delta a tincture i can't fully say the effects would be the exact same as an edible but i would assume it'd be similar and i'm kind of curious how similar that is because adultery edible like the effects are pretty great and if i can get those effects in like minutes from just pruning under my tongue like [ __ ] i might have to copy in some delta a tinctures another common way to consume delta hc and i think the most common way to consume delta thc is through vapes those are just for vapes it's like it's kind of hard to speak on it's like most people don't even like care about the dosages of vapes it's just like they just take as many hits they want so you know they feel whatever they want to feel definitely going to be taking a few hits or sometimes most of the time a lot more than just a few hits but that's that's just me [Music] thanks to dang frank you now have some idea on how those you dealt athc and if that was beneficial or helpful to you or if you just enjoyed the video drop a like on it it will really help me out and it only takes two seconds and if you enjoyed this video then you'll probably enjoy this video right here so click it and go watch", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a

pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "fNYcSUMZDow": "this is the days I with married day news and you're watching this we can beat now it may be true that many heavy metal fans love smoking weed but that love only goes one way weed fans do not love smoking heavy metals and there is one kind of heavy metal that nobody wants in their lives no it's not hair metal it's led yes we're being serious now and we're talking about lead poisoning so you better listen up as of January 1st California is requiring all bait cartridge manufacturers to have their products tested for heavy metal contamination and several testing labs have recently been finding that some vape cards contain a dangerous amount of lead it is believed that this lead contamination is coming from the metal parts of the vape cartridges themselves because many Chinese foundries a mix led with other metals in order to make it more moldable experts believe that cannabis oil may be able to absorb trace amounts of lead from these cartridges bottom line is this all the cartridges made before January 1st 2019 in California may or may not contain some lead in the oil because no one was testing for heavy metals back then retailers are still allowed to sell all inventory manufactured in 2018 so consumers should check the manufactured on dates on the label of your vape cartridges California weed producers are expecting that Chinese manufacturers will be able to provide them with lead-free vape cards within the next few months but until then you might want to consider vaping flower or just bargain up a fat joint meanwhile on the East Coast Massachusetts first two legal recreational pot stores have been opened for two months now and Sooners from all along the eastern seaboard have been flocking to the bay state to stock up on legal weed since then six more pot shops have opened their doors and demand has shown no sign of slacking between November and January retailers move twenty three point eight million dollars of weed according to the state's cannabis Control Commission state officials expect that four to eight new pot stores will open every month and it's predicted that once the industry is in full swing sales will eventually top 1.5 billion dollars a year while Massachusetts residents are enjoying the fruits of recreational legalization researchers are also taking a closer look at how medical marijuana can help patients quit using dangerous pharmaceutical drugs a recent study looked at prescription data from five million patients between 2006 and 2014 and discovered that legal medical cannabis was associated with lower odds of opioid use the study reports at the rates of acute and chronic opioid use for lower in states in a legalized medical marijuana than in prohibition states meanwhile a Canadian research team discovered that medical marijuana can also help wean patients off in benzodiazepines which are sedative drugs often used to treat anxiety insomnia and seizure disorders the study found that almost half of the study subjects were able to quit taking these prescription drugs within six months of beginning a medical marijuana program like opioids benzodiazepines have many adverse side effects including risk of addiction and overdose so a chance to replace them with a safer alternative is good news for everyone this is the deiay from Mary Jane OU's for all your weed news needs check out mary jane calm subscribe to our YouTube channels mary jane and west best TV and follow us on twitter and instagram at Mary Jane as always Godspeed and good weed", "8rXgTYuRUCw": "[Music] welcome back to the channel ladies and gentlemen I am Matt hope you're all doing well today we're gonna check out the Aegis X by geek vapor this is a dual 18650 that now has a big mass of 2.4 inches screen now obviously you're not going to get this big suitcase thing that they sent me this is obviously just some kind of promotional packaging so anyway let's go ahead and dive into it I will show you the mod and everything you're gonna get in your package so inside you will of course get your device you're gonna have this little screen protector right here you could leave that on or peel it off you'll get the Cerberus mesh sub ohm tank we've looked at this multiple times this tank has been included in a lot of different geek kits a user manual I got an extra little screen protector here and then this little envelope that I'm assuming has warranty cards and all that info maybe some warning cards yeah it looks like a promotional card warning card and warranty card and then you get an extra coil for the Cerberus tank a straight piece of glass a baggie of spare seals and o-rings an extra rubber cover here for the USB port it looks like some extra screws for the mod as well and then of course a microUSB charging an upgrade cable ok so with this tank we're not really gonna look at it much this thing's been around for quite a while kind of surprise they didn't include the the new Zeus sub ohm tank in this instead but it's still a nice little sub ohm tank top fill let's go ahead and fill it on up and then let's put the cap on and we'll put that out of the way and here is your device as expected it's built really really well IP 67 rated waterproof shockproof dustproof all that good stuff on the top here it looks fairly similar to the original Aegis legend but notice you do it does angle in more on the top so that platform is only about 27 millimeters wide I found same style 510 though same metal piece up top here these five 10s are definitely built to last you got your micro USB right here okay and then you plug that back up now on this side obviously you no longer have a screen but you got your fire button your two controls says Aegis brushed metal and then as you can see right there it's kind of interesting shape angles down a little bit I like the way that looks though I like that finish really nice button to be expected on this side here you got metal you got that rubberized coating that we've seen on other Aegis mods and then you got this leather piece right here that is cushioned and then this is going to come in a bunch of different colors this is obviously the green one and then over on this side is where you got your massive big-ass screen says geek vape right there it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but the fingerprints don't really show up once the screen is on there's the bottom there you have some venting that brushed finish again to open that compartment you pull over like that and up and that is spring-loaded obviously you got the same kind of seal around here and with that venting remember it's kind of like a breakaway style where you know it's still a waterproof shockproof dustproof but if the battery was to vent it would break the one of these seals in here and vent out the bottom so let's go ahead and put our batteries in negative up on that sides marked right there and positive up on that side then you can just push this guy down and it clicks into place actually clicks into place a little bit easier than the original Aegis legend does five clicks turns it on and there's your big old screen now you can't adjust the brightness on this fire button and up button and go all the way up to 100% if you want now it's SuperDuper bright now on that home screen you're going to have your battery bars it's gonna say m1 you got you know m1 m2 m3 m4 power mode right now standard 35 watts your resistance right there your voltage right there your amp load right there and then a puff counter right there as you can see it dims after about 10 seconds or so let's go ahead and screw our tank on it read the resistance there automatically three clicks you can see m1 is now highlighted you can scroll between m1 m2 m3 m4 so you basically have those different profiles you can create press the fire button again see power is highlighted you can go to a variable wattage curve variable power curve bypass mode stainless steel TCR nickel TCR titanium TCR and just TCR TCR if you have a different kind of temp control metal you want to use back to power hit the fire button again over here in standard you can do powerful soft so that's a preheat right there and then obviously that'll be different depending on if you're in temperature control or Montand temperature control mode or not you can adjust your TCR over there let's go back to standard here then you can set your resistance right there and reset your puffs right there now when something is highlighted here if you press the up and down button that gets us into this menu so that auto right there just deals with the resistance then you got theme right here and now you can swap between themes pretty cool then you got color right here and you can adjust your color red green blue orange next version that'll just tell you your firmware one thing I haven't been able to figure out is what this abb is something dealing with your batteries maybe like automatic balance or something like that I'm not sure exactly what that means I looked it up and could not figure it out and then of course you have reset right there as far as other features if you press the up and down button when you're on that home screen that locks it you can still fire but these controls don't work so that's pretty much it it's a really big screen kind of similar to the original geek vape Aegeus legends board right a lot of people did complain because that screen was so small on that thing now you have a big massive screen and this plastic panel does feel very very thick and strong and you guys know the Aegis legend series is just built really really well as far as size comparisons there it is that next normal legend well this is the special edition but it's the same shape about the same size as you can see very very close you know some of the shapes are a little bit different on it but it's pretty close to the same type of form factor this one actually feels a little bit better in the hand because you got these bevels going on as opposed to this one where you got a little more of an edge there and edge right there stuffs a little more rounded and you know beveled basically on the X here so when I use this thing it's usually a pointer fire or you could obviously thumb fire like that and here's the block one I've been using alright guys that is it for the up-close let's go ahead go up top vape these and talk about them a little more all right here's the aegis X kit the airflow on the tank is wide open 60 watts reading point one six let's vape it so stump firing right there now will pointer fire yeah now as far as the Cerberus tank goes it's the same old tank it works really well the coils are pretty good even at a lower wattage like 60 65 watts or so so it's definitely not a throwaway tank now let's go ahead and talk pros and cons with the mod as far as cons go there's not much one thing to be aware of is that this platform is not as wide as on the Aegis legend so I think the Aegis legend was like 30 millimeters or so with this one 27 millimeters so a 28 millimeter Adi might look okay but a 30 millimeter will definitely have some overhang on the plastic panel is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but you really don't see them once you know the screen is lit up like that you really just see it when it's when it's dark and that's really all I got I mean it might take a little bit of getting used to because you got the controls on the side here and you know the screen is on the face but I haven't had any problems with that at all I mean it's solid you basically have an Aegis legend with a big old screen so you know I know some people did complain about the original Aegis legend and the smaller screen also on the original sometimes when you're outside it did have some glare and it was a little bit hard to read now you got this massive screen that anyone's going to be able to see the resolution on it is really nice the colors on it really pop you get a few extra added features you know you can change the layout of the screen change some colors stuff like that a lot easier to do your variable curves too on a bigger screen like this I also like some of the bevels they added on this you know it doesn't have any like sharp not that the other one was sharp I'm still you know rubber edges but doesn't have any of those you know angles there that you feel in your hand this feels more rounded a little more refined very very comfortable in the hand and as far as weight goes it feels about the same as the Aegis legend maybe even slightly lighter but it's close so all in all who's this for maybe you're an Aegis fan you want a new Aegis anyway your legend you've been using for a year or two maybe you always had issues with the screen and that's why you didn't buy one you didn't want one with the one with the smaller screen or maybe you like the way this one looks more it's an Aegis legend with a big-ass screen that looks really cool so basically they took one of the most popular dual battery mods that we've seen probably the most popular dual battery mod we've seen in the last two years or so and they've made it a bit better with a big old screen on the side now people may be concerned about this panel or something but it still does have that rating and the panel does not feel cheap at all it feels thick and so I kind of doubt your your gonna have any issues with cracking the panel on this buttons feel great on it yeah I don't have many issues besides the the few that I stated now as first price goes you're gonna be able to get this mod for around 55 to 60 bucks by itself or the kit goes for around 75 80 bucks let's end it there folks that about wraps it up until next time thanks for watching suck my mud", "hxxVrOv-v1I": "stop buying fake vape carts off the street because you know what you are smoking chemicals and i'm going to show you the chemicals you're smoking and it's not going to be nice you're going to feel disgusted and unfortunately that's what people do when they live in illegal states where marijuana is not legal but i'm going to give you a solution so if you live in a state where marijuana and thc vapes are not legal i'm going to show you how you can get it anywhere in the country online shipped right to your door but anyways my name's chris i'm with cbd and thc extract.co and i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and by the way if you haven't tried our hemp flour yet hit the link in the description below and you can get an eighth of our flour completely for free doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link below to claim the offer but anyways if you've been on the street you know that these glow carts and supreme cards and all these different carts are all over the place and even in illinois where weed is legal people are buying these illegal street brands literally because it's cheaper than the dispensary that's kind of sad but unfortunately there's a lot of price gouging in illinois but anyways i digress these carts actually have lead and ethyl acetate in them specifically glow carts so if you look at the lab test i'm going to pop it up on the screen right now what you're going to see in these lab tests is that there's trace amounts of lead probably in the hardware itself right heavy metals and you can see that there's ethyl acetate as well who knows if they're using it as a cutting agent or maybe it's part of the hardware as well but ethyl acetate is basically a derivative of glue um yeah you don't want to be smoking glue i mean do you want to be vaping glue do you want to inhale heavy metals because i don't know if you remember the vape epidemic that went on and i think it was 2019 about last year and kids were getting sick from vape sucks that it was kids really they should have been adults but um supposedly the theory is is that these kids were smoking vape cartridges that were basically street carts right and these street carts what they had in them is the lead or heavy metals or cutting agents and specifically with the lead obviously is very toxic that's why they took it out the pencils in school now they use graphite um because it was literally kids were dying same thing with the vape ironically and basically they were vaping oil all the way down to the bottom of the cart and when they vaped it to the bottom of the cart they started to burn the wick and the heating element and when they burned that heating element not only were they burning the heating element but they were inhaling the toxic lead that was contained in that heating element and come on really do you want to save a couple bucks and inhale chemicals i mean do you want to end up like those kids in the hospital literally last year and even with covet going on i mean health is everyone's number one priority right now i think everyone's has that priority and here's the funny thing glow cart's the company they try to act all transparent like oh we got these uh little qr codes where you can verify it's real that doesn't mean anything because you can go to dhgate.com and buy the packaging and you could buy the empty carts by yourself for dirt cheap so and the thing is even if you get the real glow carts the real ones from glow carts whatever that is whatever that entity is it's it's funny because the lab test that they posted shows the lead and it shows the ethyl acetate in the product maybe they thought just because they have a lab test that it's okay and it's totally safe maybe they don't even know how to read a laptop and obviously no one else does because no one looks into the stuff they just see oh thc vape let me smoke that or let me vape that they don't really look into the details they don't think what kind of vape cartridge is it what kind of is it distillate oils they're cutting agents right what kind of turps are they using they don't look into any of this stuff they just see oh like that looks cool cool packaging bro it's cheaper than the dispensary or i can't get it anywhere else that's just really sad you don't want to end up in the hospital but anyways if you want a solution what i'm going to tell you is there's a new product that's out on the market it's taking the hemp market by storm it's pretty crazy it's called delta 8 thc and basically because of the 2018 farm bill that the president signed basically what it did is it legalized hemp derived compounds for example delta 8 thc can be derived from hemp so basically if you get thc and extracted from hemp now it's legal federally which means you can buy it online and you can get it shipped to your door so what you can do is you can go online right now and type in delta 8 thc cartridge and buy thc right now and the thing that's great about it is that if you're 18 that's fine because most dispensaries are 21 and up for hemp the federal law is that it's only 18. 18 plus watch out there but anyways it's only 18 plus and it's cheaper than the dispenser at least here in illinois the cartridges at the dispensary like 72 bucks for half a gram for a cart where a delta 8 cartridge online is you know anywhere from 50 60 bucks and it gets shipped to your door that's before discounts and whatnot so point is if you want to buy delta a thc and protect your health and stay away from the dirty street vendors that are putting cutting agents and chemicals in your products that you're inhaling into your lungs i'm going to leave a link down below where you can buy delta a thc a couple of vendors you can get your hands on it and try it out for yourself it's just like the delta nine only it's delta eight has a double bond instead of a single bond on a molecular level i'm not a chemist or anything but i know that much so i hope you enjoy that information about why you should never ever smoke vape carts off the street ever again because it's really just disgusting so if you like content like this leave a comment let me know what you think but thanks have a great day", "J3T9Xo7ZiE0": "you know shout out to all my [ __ ] stoners out there worldwide today I got a THC clear cartridge you know - homie just picked it up and he was

guys for your eyepiece hi chicks right there supreme this is not the courage and here this is the Apollo grown cartridge but we have it plugged into our mods already this is what it looks like as a clear tip oh so apparently they're from the car we just are from so we're apparently when we're in Cali we're supposed to buy these cartridges from my homie that we matter and beyond wonder man yeah that's what don't go out raves to meet homies from now you stay with forever cuz social media you always see what what they're doing in life updates on them and yeah we were supposed to buy these from

that shit's super smooth oh yeah yeah I think right now my throat is like Bernie but the brass knuckles smooth again but I really like eight out of ten not that bad yeah it do a lot of smoke yeah we got a long car down in the past that oh my god yeah the one I have actually [ __ ] up on me because I was so bad dude I was saying at work and I have my courage it was me working like I literally had Google I was like Hawaiians a microchip battery where key are like the pen and I look at YouTube it and then like this guy said it might be your courageous another battery because my my battery's like fairly new and then so I fixed it so if you're in cartridge does it like come out you're gonna have to wiggle that middle part you can see like a rubber band in there and move away and don't work ready in there yeah so yeah yeah you know then the smoke came out a lot there's a lot of someone that came is very flavorful yeah you can really taste the flavor so Anchorage's we approve get them why you guys get a chance yeah I get the grout I know as generic supreme it's not the real supreme one day I mean brand but it's pretty legit to us so a Supremes probably collab with supreme with another disspell company I don't know but get these cans gonna end the video off here check all the links down below in the description follow us by for my amazon store we see you guys tomorrow in the next video peace [Music]", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you don't have to do but it'd be [ __ ] greatly appreciated so I visage for that peace out", "Tz50RBGv2xQ": "I must show you this real try some more the strawberries taste like strawberries the snozzberries taste like snozzberries what's going on everybody so I want to do this review it's just some stuff that just came into the dispensary ride from down for me this is by the the clear concentrate confidence it's called to clear this is a banana cream these are for bait cartridges they fit through your basic 510 thread so the two kinds that I've tried so far from them have been the banana cream which I pretty sure I think is I'm pretty sure is banana OG the strain but it does taste like bananas and the blue razz is is that as blue dream that tastes like raspberries and then it does have the taste so first of all let's talk about content and medicinal as you can see it's definitely been refined it's a nice clear color that you know so it's not dark and gar so it's got a nice clear color I will tell you this the first few times that I hit it again this is your typical wick cartridge system but they have fixed the cartridges a little bit better on these to where there were used to be a problem down here at the bottom with the metal which would be a they would leak and be they were really weak so they kind of sucked like as far as if you put them in your pocket or anything like that so they've kind of worked a little bit on these um I was able to put them in my pocket and my jacket and I didn't have any problems these ones the banana cream and this one the purple Rhys I can tell you this it took about let's see I would say five really really good drawers and I was like stupid medicated to just basically it to me basically just to kind of get doing what I needed to do or go around about my day that kind of stuff I went talking basically it took me just a couple drawers I used one of my other another one of my attachments which is kind of like a cigarette thing where you just pull on it you don't have to push a button or anything and I still got huge huge drawers out of this so this is a this product right here so FAR's medicinally as far as taste and everything else I would give it a big thumbs up this is pretty good now I want to tell you this these are $60 they don't specify how many milligrams was in here or any that kind of stuff as far that kind of stuff so I would assume that these are a grand they look like they're about a gram so anyway but these are sixty bucks apiece I don't know if they're nug Ron trim Ron's or the devil se but one thing too is that there's some of the other ones really you know the terpenes the flavor and them kind of burns the back of your throat well not these ones these ones it's very subtle you barely feel it and anything but so if you get a chance to try these out I would definitely highly recommend them it's the clear they have about 15 or 20 nor 20 other different flavors so if your dispensary as the opportunity to get them in you might be able to get them cheaper in your area so close to live in a prohibition area so again check them out the clear cartridges for vape pens awesome Lumpy's chicken grease amen try some of this it's absolutely dynamite", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy", "pU-8iPFGDqo": "yo guys what's going on even here today I'm gonna be doing a video of me reviewing a runts cart so here is a picture of the cart actually let me move my something I might appear because it's making that look weird so that's what it looks like and I'm gonna go ahead put on the Clark so this is what its gonna look like this would be a picture that's a thumbnail and this is a different type of cart so I'm gonna go ahead take it off put it over here and I'll go ahead and open up this cartridge I opened up the wrong side give me a scientist of course I did so before i opening industrial box oh whatever that's it so I'm going to go ahead and open the box so I have to take it out like that and you're gonna have this at the bottom so just thinking off I'm gonna go ahead and put this on my other cart put this in almost dropped it and there we go I don't see any bubbles at all on this list is like completely for I'm gonna go ahead turn it on and give it a preheat so let it preheat for a little bit just so the coil soaks it up and all that okay and they're gonna go ahead and give it a hit jeez my fan is off and it's right there but I think my my a/c is still on so it's kind of annoying and you'll see if I can go ahead and turn that off so it says I just turned it off hopefully it did I'll try to hit it again but it tastes like like strawberries it does taste pretty good so pink runs for some reason when I'm in my car I do ghosts the best that's weird that was okay it was okay so I'm gonna go ahead read what it says best bio 1:7 2020 THC eighty-eight point twenty five percent THC five point eighty milligrams serving CBD zero and that's pretty much it and then it just says like the governmental warning now I bet have to come it's gonna be like oh it's fake it's week I don't like here tastes pretty good dang there's only like two bubbles and they're like super super small that's it often those all those hits like two bubbles on my car - it was fun I got hella good OHS and here I can't get good OHS I type a - getting from here pretty good it is just a teba so to keep me up I'm not gonna be going to sleep anytime soon I hope so it's my first time hitting it actually it's my second time hitting it because I hit my friends before but I only had to like once take that off put back the other one yeah so the bubbles are really small you can't really even see the balls so I do like these carts I'll put it back have it later OOP wrong clip wrong port and there you go try back my other cart this one doesn't really have as much as a flavor but this one gets me so I like this one I like this one you will hit that so from now on guys I don't know if you guys have noticed I've been doing a little bit editing but for now until I see more subs and stuff like that I'm gonna start doing just the video so the so I can get more uploads going out for you guys so it kind of evens out because when I had it done you get one like maybe a once a week or two every week I'll try to do like for every week analysis all there's gonna be like a tiny bit less editing because I barely added them as it is I'm just gonna upload them to keep doing uploads so let me know what you guys think of that I think that won't be better so I think that's watching this Ethan signing out peace", "8b1M0o0Xr2o": "oh my god i like a mad scientist oh what's up everybody how can you speak what's up everybody green light here welcome back to another video here we go this is what we're doing so today i got oh my god my [ __ ] hair i got this thing called surplus it's a cart i was like i love green this looks cool i gotta get it 40 bucks for full gram that's not bad at all cheapest ones they had called surplus made or not made by heavy hitters but like supported by heavy hitters i'm kind of distributed by them i think i don't know but there's something to do with them sativa purple lemonade i also have a blackberry kush one which is an indica but i don't want to spoil what it looks like so i'm not gonna show you so they come in a bag i love the way it looks i love the green logo right here whatever it says can't read because it's flipped around on my phone one gram right there they didn't have it in half grams though only four grams so at least my place no height just high is what it says in the back how to say supposed to open it because i hate opening these things i won't lie it says okay what do you do so you how do you open this so you take it i did it first try damn never happens inside the bag looks like uh let's look at the inside of a bag there you can see the cart green tip it does not normally have a golden bottom that's only because today i'm smoking it on the aries tick which i'll have a review of hope fully soon this is the box looks like but i'm not going to spoil it but i love it i've been using it a lot all right this is what it looks like it's um has a green tip which i think is so [ __ ] sick i've never seen that and i love it it says surplus right there you probably can't see that hold on that's not gonna want to work is it a little california sticker make sure it has those obviously if it doesn't it's fake let's put it in normally like i said doesn't have this but it's just the adapter for this sadly they're barely too tall oh come on you can go around it but then oh only thing it's a little bit of a bummer they're a little tall most carts fit this is the only car i've had problems with sad but it's okay like i said purple lemonade sativa it is 11 19 pm i got work tomorrow 4 p.m it's okay we're gonna do it anyways sativa here we go cheers it's so good i mean it's called purple lemonade it can't be that bad right yeah it's a it doesn't taste too fruity do i have a drink right somewhere it's very good like i said it tastes like purple lemonade more purple to me which i usually associate with indicas grapey flavors but that's just me it is the sativa i don't know what strange this mixing exactly to say on the back maybe oh you know what it might let me check take off this tag okay i lied it doesn't say that it's coming at 84 percent oh i can't hold it up oh yeah i cut myself don't worry about it 84. not bad i get a the aftertaste is lemony but the most prominent flavor to me is the purple but the lemonade is mainly the aftertaste like i only taste lemonade right now let's do bubble test jesus that was dumb i won't lie i'm kind of high i was high before but now i'm a little more high i'm just taking my head wait i want to be able to see the window so how can i do that it sucks that the window's not on this side like why why why put the it's like a blinker right i gotta stop complaining he's gonna take a blanket for the video here we go my mustache is barely there but it looks like a pedophile cheers blinker huh i hope there we go let's do a review very good forty 40 grams oh [ __ ] anyways yeah it's really good uh as you can see it [ __ ] you up pretty hard thank you it is actually very smooth i mean this battery the full charge okay [ __ ] hits like a truck and that blinker holy [ __ ] i don't know how long that was i'm gonna assume 10. did you play 15. oh my god you know when you can take a blinker and you hit it and it makes as you could feel it that moment you just start to feel it build up and it's like [ __ ] that's it all right i feel invisible it's a good thing sometimes you take it and it [ __ ] you right in the ass it's happening right now and by the way the blackberry crush is even better different video on that eventually all right you can just tell i'm [ __ ] up look at my eyelashes i like spongebob eyelashes now so so taste i'm gonna give a four to five wheat stars the high of it oh [ __ ] up really high the high of it i'm gonna give that 4.5 only five wheat stars and the packaging and like the look of it i mean five out of five i love it i love the green the green tip so cool and guys it looks so good on this battery i mean come on oh look at that look at that oh my god it's perfect i love it man tastes great hit hard overall i'd give surplus both of these cards i guess a 4.5 out of 5 wheat stars guys thank you for watching", "OAeayndHR_I": "so serious let's go I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this or before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information yo what's up guys you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this

today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "BXdDk8yN4ys": "what's goodie youtube so first video on the new cameraman I have to even I'm hoping that this is so focusing because this is such an upgrade from my old camera and the past camera that I was using in the past it was a Sony - and it was a mere less camera but it was such a dull version of what I have now so I used to be rocking with the a600 with the kit lens everything he know was going full noob mode but you know it was getting the work done and recently I upgraded to the Sony a7 3 which is what you guys are watching now yeah like I was saying so that's pretty much what you guys are watching me on now is the a 73 and I have to say dude I love it so far I've tried everything on it so far I mean I haven't really gone out and done photography with it yet but the videos that I've done with it it is literally so freakin crisp dude and I love it so let me go ahead and focus this up real quick alright so today guys for the first topic of the video man I'm just gonna be session out its neck and I'm not gonna be doing any product reviews or anything like that but it's mostly going to be just a really cool sesh and we're gonna be talking about um we're gonna be talking about cartridges in general because recently my brother-in-law not recently probably like I would say like I'm maybe three four weeks I guess recently three or four weeks ago he got diagnosed with chemical leukemia and he said he told me and my wife which is his sister that um he got it from smoking cartridges and like obviously it doesn't matter what cartridges he was smoking I feel like at the end of the day all cartridges are bad for you in the long run you know it doesn't matter I mean I feel like maybe some for some it's worse than others because so you know bodies are built differently and you know some some people have iron lungs a human human bodies when they can go ahead and withstand all that stuff that that the cartridges give but then there's some other people were that like you know he used to smoke a lot of cartridges too like he used to go to the carts of like pretty fast if I do remember so I'm gonna go ahead and load this dab up real quick I got some raw garden right here this is the kosher tangi I'm pretty much almost gone with it but this is pretty phenomenal did i've been dabbing a lot of I've been dabbing a lot of raw garden lately just because of how cheap it is and you guys know man I I mean when it comes to smoking dude so much has changed in smoking like I feel like in the past I used to just um I used to buy literally anything and everything and now I'm just kind of like I kind of you know just wait see what's good if there's nothing good then I'm just like whatever what's the point of even spending money on this anyway so we have this thing heating up for you guys right here we're gonna give you taking quick grips this is a sativa so hopefully it gets me nice and up uppity so I hope you guys are having an amazing day I hope you guys are having a great week so far it's Thursday already I took the day off today cuz it's my son's birthday you guys why are you recording a video on your son's birthday only it's cuz they left so he there probably won't be back for another three hours or so so I'm chilling man you guys another deal literally the only time that I ever have for myself to record videos is when they're not here so what you kind of works out cuz I I don't like smoking when they're here like you know I mean my wife it's whatever but but you know you guys know when it comes to kids no smoking in or around the vicinity of kids that so that's a no-go for me especially when it's my kid you know I don't why I had to deal with any issues like that in the later future when I can prevent it now you know prevent myself from samokhin you know it's not it doesn't it's not that hard to just stop smoking for an hour or two but that completely duped me off topic like I said um yeah talking about cartridges men so my brother-in-law got diagnosed with chemical leukemia he was very very sick for some time he couldn't figure out what it was and then after some time in the hospital they told them that he had come leukemia and he's he he looked into it and he's he thought himself that it's from you know cartridges because you get it from pesticide you get it from pretty much poisonous stuff in getting inhaled into your lungs and he would smoke streak cards he would smoke Street cards he would get it off brand you know and he what he didn't know he didn't know at the time but then after it's like doing some research she was like yeah dude my cards were fake and that really just goes to show like leaving him he says and now he's like I'm just gonna go ahead and pay the extra twenty fifteen dollars you know for a good cartridge because they do these things can kill you man these pesticides and all these chemicals in general can kill you like even me do I feel like my lungs are not what they used to be like one if you guys go back in my videos when I first started making the videos now I would hardly call if I would Li you know I would be taking blinker hits to the head back to back blinker heads and he was just like it was crazy but now dude if you guys watch my videos I coughed constantly you know it's not and obviously have something to do with me - because I there was a point where my cousin told me you if you ain't smoking if you're not confident smoking so then I was like damn that hit me hard virologist I just sit there for him and faded and just took that in I was like if you're not tough and you're not smoking they told me obviously because coughing gets you higher and then usually good stuff is he is gonna have you coughing when the weak stuff is just gonna have you you know feeling like you just hit a hit off the vape so yeah so that brings me on to my next like it's still in the same topic but that brings me on to my next conclusion where I feel like cartridges in general just are not safe for you to be smoking and that's another reason why I've been cutting down on them I know you guys see a lot of cartridge videos but if you guys think about it I shoot like one one cartridge video like every two weeks so it's not it's not even that many I I've dumbed it down a lot though so we're gonna go ahead and take this reheat on a blue setting you dude cool temp dabs have to be my favorite man I need to buy myself a new banger my other one broke so yeah alright so my next topic is gonna be pretty much cartridges in general I just don't feel like they're safe because alright if you guys don't know the process of what of how a cartridge is it produces any vapor production so pretty much there's a coil or there's a coil in the center on the bottom hold on one second freaking thing is trash day today dad I saw someone taking up in my trash can killers all right so if you guys don't know the process of how vapor gets made through a cartridge basically the process that it goes through there's a coil there's a coil a metal coil on the bottom right and that's that coil on the bottom is surrounded by wick which is cotton it's a special form of Japanese cotton I'm guessing I didn't really I haven't really looked into many cartridges but I'm guessing that's what most of them are use they should at least be using is some organic Japanese cotton because that's like the safe is con you can use when when creating vapor products so alright and then that's and then so you got the long piece in the middle and show you guys real quick so you got the long you got the metal right here you got the the white those little white spots are down there those are those are that's cotton right there alright nuts surrounding the base coil and then right here you got the main coil that this is used for the airflow and so pretty much when you hit it heats up the coil heating up the wig and then creating vapor creating it through the airway and then into your mouth and into your lungs so my process is so you guys are not at all if you guys really have looked into have ever taken any health classes any science classes hit anything you guys know you guys are not supposed to be inhaling anything that comes from a heated metal clay anything that has to do with any any metal because that metal right by itself when it's heated up to a certain temperature the toxins and all the stuff that it releases within the vapor production it's just so bad for you do too like I'm not even gonna sit here and act like I know exactly what it does to you what it gives to you but you know I have taken classes of this stuff that I've learned in my pet in the past and I know that it's harmful for you and I know and there's been study cases all that stuff and you know and yeah I mean but but the thing is like cartridges are so convenient cartridges are so easy to get cartridges are so cheap for what you get but like you could get gram for 30 $40 nowadays and that's that's killer dude especially if you're on the go like me like that's the only time I ever use cartridges when I'm making a video or on the go you will never catch me just session on the cartridge unless it's like late at night I don't want to freaking take a hit off the putco because it's too much work or I don't want to go outside and hit hit up freaking J or whatever the case is you know yeah so I don't even know if I should take another DAP but I guess we should just to keep the video going cuz I feel like it's going good so far so we're gonna load this up get another one in here like I said the coach returns you from rock garden it has a very very even like tangi taste to it like I'm not even my life you guys I've ever had tangi you guys know that tangent gives you like such a pungent like it hits you in the back of your nose and that's exactly what this does to me I love it so what is your guys's thoughts on this man have you guys ever do you guys feel sick when hitting cartridges do you guys feel different do you guys know anything about cartridges and if it's giving it for you or obviously it's not gonna be good for you anything that has to do with smoking obviously I'm not saying that cartridges are better than a puff coat or it's better than a hit in a blunt you know cuz any type of form of inhaling you're gonna have some toxins something that's gonna be messing your lungs up and could possibly lead to cancer and any other disease you know that's why they have to label it on the packaging that it may cause cancer so I want to take one off the green right here and yeah let me know what you guys have been in smoking on lately let me know in the comments below if you guys are 21 - no or California only oh that's stuff I don't even know all these restrictions that YouTube has applying towards the whole freaking world but you guys know we just came back from the beach - it's 35 o'clock in the afternoon so I am tired I'm ready to take a shower and just knock out yep that's it for me I've also really been trying to live in myself of how much I smoke because I don't know what it is do my lungs have just not been the same like I said I get I get like a tingling sensation now I feel like that might be just built up like mucus wax stuff like that I mean I I take care of myself you know I take care of myself as much as I can but it doesn't really matter how much you take care of if you're doing things that are gonna cause risk you put you at at risk to hurt like your body or damage any part of your body I mean that's just stuff that you have to deal with you know like that stuff that I have to deal with now that stuff that my brother-in-law had to deal with when he was smoking those cartridges you know and it's just it slips through our mind you just kind of I guess like what I'm trying to get out today is just trying to keep you guys safe trying to like get you to know your limits get to get you to know like what you're smoking on how much you should be smoking when you should be smoking you know and like just take caring of yourself take care of your body take care of your lungs if you're gonna be smoking just limit yourself two to three times a day morning afternoon night time you know there's no need to be smoking every hour every two hours you know things like that because at the end of the day I mean you're just hurting yourself you're just hurting yourself you might be feeling good in the moment but in the long run you're gonna be feeling like [ __ ] and this is coming from a cannabis influencer or someone who does it on the daily you know this is I'm just trying to educate the people so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video there I hope you guys had an amazing video session with me I hope like the video if you did go ahead even luck go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll hit you guys later", "0dGf5pK_PAA": "you know guys what is up we are back but we are in my car because I have to go to [ __ ] school on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great news I'm gonna give you awesome green news we're gonna do number four might as well write Cheers oh no Jason brake [ __ ] send help I'm dying all right guys my conclusion with this cart for this quick little sesh this for hit sesh right before school right it's a [ __ ] Cenac or there's no other way to put it I'm on four hits and I'm I'm pretty high I'm I'm not like slow like to level right but [ __ ] I'm in like I don't even know what kind of hide this is well guys I'm gonna end the video there this will probably be up on Saturday so you

holiday and while you were shipping our presents some people were mailing weed here's Denver 7 investigative reporter Jace Larson oh you know it's busy at the post office this time of year and while many of these packages have legal presence inside not all of them do and some of those people that come to Colorado and buy their personal use marijuana and want to ship it home and we want to let people know don't come to Colorado and mail your drugs back home it's kind of common sense but new numbers I received through the Federal Open Records Act show a sizeable spike in marijuana mailings the big increases definitely recreational marijuana became legal in 2014 and the number of people caught trying to illegally mail pot has gone up significantly cents to a whopping 805 last year postal inspectors in the West Metro Drug Task Force caught this guy Steven Anderson sending at least 30 marijuana packages out of state in 2015 and listened to his punishment a federal judge sent him away to a federal prison for a year some of the other package is caught with marijuana were sent between Colorado cities it's still illegal to mail because you're using the federal u.s. mail system and it's prohibited at the federal level some people think they can mask the smell of the marijuana by putting in some coffee grounds other people have tried to use peanut butter people suggest ways to be able to get around a drug dog or to get around the postal inspectors I'll tell you I've seen so many ways attempt and fail inspectors do not x-ray every single package and there's just too many of them to have a drug dog scan each one but there are postal inspectors all over the country so even if the package isn't caught where it's mailed here in Denver it might be caught at its destination Jace

close that back up but I mean y'all need this but it's pretty pretty cool a box where you can keep Cupidon to not forget you can reven Wright name on it because it doesn't like the little it's not as much as this box I mean the wherever you're hitting it obviously you can tell the difference between this and then another [ __ ] way doc let me take up the other one like at first like and looking looking at them like you can't tell the difference between them right but hitting them you can tell like the different effects but it's good to have like something where you can put it in where you could be like oh yeah this is a savio gene this is whatever else you have or whatever you should have been open that's why I was reviewing mine you're holding pretty quality and because consistency welcome to the new industry standard tree based it says a hybrid strain with a pungent OG flavor possesses pine notes with a sharp spicy citrus overlay that is so characteristic of OG Wi-Fi OG vapes cleanly and provides a comprehensive great and something I wanted to show you guys is now it has different things on it like I actually shows the total THC total all it shows when it was produced it shows who you can call and all that you see all that new [ __ ] that they put in and as you guys can see it's different color than the old ones because the old ones look different Oh watch I'll show her old package or but look different kind of yellow either ways the old packaging is like this right here good yellow I like you just pull it out now let's take a poll you guys would be able to see the smoke more there was a little bit but you guys until there's a lot of fun it looks beautiful I think I saw I have a little bit of the other one so that I've been saving it I thought my pen is alive does it fit though it's just it's she's mine oh look you can tell the difference in color did it work I've been saving the Sun I've just been hitting the other pendants to keep dropping [ __ ] tree bass clear I feel like it'd kill us busy hmm yeah but they don't make full batteries yeah they do have batteries I just don't know where they sell them I felt right away but it's that much of it as a burn oh my [ __ ] you're really is really here yeah I mean that the that tastes good so yeah what does that one taste like cuz I don't get playing small for it oh it tastes like what it said it no no it tasted like like knowing they didn't taste like that laughs I see you Freddie no it tastes it it tasted like og Oh like OG Kush and og not Otis Lee like have you ever had like oh this for you guys oh gee coach or any other oh gee strains yeah basically they Gil have a different type for taste and that's what it gives and it does give that it Doug if you're have it in your mouth it does you can feel the scent of pine you don't taste it but you feel the Senate I don't know if you get what I mean Wi-Fi OG and this is and dizzy which is ssv oh geez all right yeah they're both I would recommend both I got this one for 55 the gram great and look at it and it looks way better than before it doesn't look as dark looks like cat piss looks great that's not supposed to look and this one looks great too if this one came in a program it'd be great but both of them are great I would recommend both if you can get them if you can't then I try to get a kingpin or something that has great flavor not as potent but great flavor try to my friend", "_AmByqFQRE4": "what's up guys good guy sit here with another good guy first looks today we bring you the aegis X kit so I'm pretty excited to review this product this actually was sent super early and I'm very interested to see what changes they made the legend was exactly what it was called it was a legend it had pretty much everything that a average vapor would need shock resistant water resistant it was a great device so I'm interested to see some of the changes that they made to this box it's gonna go ahead and read off the back see what's inside the kit and some of the specs here and it says legendary Aegis is now back with a 2.4 inch OLEDs display screen designed with your ability and user experience Aegis X is the most advanced dual battery device to date that is a ballsy statement powered with the new AAS 2.0 chipset that is twice more powerful we're gonna find out just how powerful let's get into the specs we have ip67 water and dust resistance high shock resistance upgraded AAS chip fast and accurate so I'm guessing that hit will be much more consistent which is always a great thing to point for oled screen for vivid display powers from 5 watts to 200 watts let's see what's inside this box it says the 1 Aegis mod 1 Cerebrus tank pre-installed super mesh x1 coil point 2 ohm resistance with the bubble glass that holds 5.5 mils that's a huge tank let's see what else do we have in here we have a spare glass tube that holds 4 mils so you actually lose a mil and a half by replacing that glass if you ever needed to there is another coil inside this box it's a super mesh x1 coil the resistance is at point 2 ohms there's a USB cable user manual and spare parts as well as a promotional card and warranty let's take a closer look we got the box unwrapped and as always get a little preview of what the device should look like on the front of the box let's go ahead and open it so there we have the device let me go ahead and pull that device out and I it's actually pretty similar in as like the legend it's very very close in size it might actually be a slightly smaller therefore more comfortable to the grip as you guys can see and the only difference I see here is that while you're holding device it probably will be held in your left hand I would say cuz this screen is all here unless you don't really need to see screen than you could hold it that way but let me give you guys a nice little look of what this looks like we got the fire button on the front with the up wattage and down wattage we have the USB up top with the 510 in the center USB obviously has a little plug on it so that no water gets inside so we have our signature look here with a nice little metal trim with the leather on the side I'm sure they'll come with different variants and colors and then on the other side you just have this big screen we did not go over the box of goodies I love my box of goodies let's go ahead and pulled out that foam insert and right away we have our Cerberus tank let me go ahead and pull it out it is can't wait to test that out and see how it is then we have on the side here boom our little box with accessories manual and warranty card we're gonna set that to the side cuz we want to see what's inside the box if I remember correctly they have nice USB cables that they send alright pretty simple nothing too crazy not that it needs to be but what else is in here spare parts as they said and a spare coil I don't see the spoke that's in there it's in there don't fret guys there's your spare glasses remember you go from 5.5 to 4 mils when you have to replace your glass so this would be good as a backup in the meantime while you look for the original blaster let's put all this stuff away take a little closer look at the tank and the device so here we are we have the coal that came inside the box the super mesh X 1 to point 2 ohm resistance coil can be used from 30 to 90 watts best use between 60 and 80 watts so we're gonna set these two aside I'm gonna go ahead and fill the tank to let that coil pry them up a little bit we're gonna take a closer look at the devices and see what that big screen looks like [Music] one thing I did notice about filling this tank I like that type of design when it comes to tanks instead of having to deal with threads it's actually more of like a almost like a puzzle piece they kind of go in and then they lock I like that the design really really simple easy for the user here it is let's go ahead and turn it on get that nice logo on the front that bright screen really really nice and we did take a second to kind of go over some of the features so that we can show you guys I'm sure you'll have questions because they say it's the most powerful trip out there I want to take a moment and kind of get a little used to some of the features to really show you guys a couple different things I might not go over all of them but I'll go over a couple things that you guys will be able to see where the rest of the settings are so the first thing I noticed is right off of that just to change wattage it is your up and down now if you look on the top here it does say m1 that means there are presets that you can save now if I click three times on the fire button that will put me into a mode selector I can yep that'll put me into a mode select where I can hit this button to scroll through each setting to either reset my puff counter change the resistance lock the resistance change it from wattage to temperature control to all these different settings that are there now once it brings you to this menu you can actually scroll down waited a little too long there has a five second timeout and what you do is once you set your setting you wait five seconds it'll bring you back to the main menu weak to change wattage and babe so let's click it three times now we're in mode select hit the up and down together now I have myself in the menu change a theme hit the fire button brings you back it up and down wattage to change the screen look looks like they have three different settings sounds actually pretty cool I know if you guys can see that it's kind of like a dark setting I'm gonna go ahead and go back to that menu oh and if you don't click that button three times it'll actually lock the device you just go ahead and hold them together again till it says unlocked if you leave it's two clicks and then on the second click hold it in now it says unlocked three clicks of the fire button once again now we're in mode select up and down wattage together brings us to another menu we're gonna go back to theme select it and change it back to this one because that was the brightest one now back to that menu by hitting the fire button we're gonna go down to color and you guys can scroll through all the different colors that they have that's very very cool we're gonna leave it on good guy green here and yeah so you just keep going down you can change all of these settings or if you just wait five seconds it will eventually go right back to the regular setting where you can go ahead and vape so we're gonna go ahead and actually vape this thing finally we went over all this most of the specs and how to go through the menu settings might take a little getting used to as the timing is precise three seconds or five seconds and it will reset if you don't get to the next menu within that time so let's go ahead and actually vape this device now so there we have it that's a quite a bit of settings on this device I would say this isn't really like a starter kit kind of thing this would be for somebody who likes to mess with all those settings in their vapes definitely not for the person going from cigarettes into vaping we have it set up on 45 watts right now and right now I'm gonna change the power setting as it goes from soft to standard to powerful on the power mode which is the wattage mode I'm assuming that soft to standard and powerful means soft will have a ramp-up time about ten percent of your hit into the regular hit standard will just be your direct hit powerful will be increased that hit by 10% that's pretty interesting so we're gonna start it with soft and see how that does on 45 watts again this coil best used between 60 and 80 but I have it starting on 45 just to kind of not burn that cool right off the bat that's 45 Watts on soft let's turn that up I'm pretty sure I'm a cloud out this room right now 50 watts so soft is pretty cool because some people don't like that hit to punch you in the face me I like my vapor to punch me in the face we have it on 50 watts now on standard this thing plumes just I would say it's a pretty I mean III wouldn't know scientifically if that's an actual 50 watt hit or anything but it feels much more consistent on the hip for sure let's go ahead I have it on 55 now you want let's just bring it right to 60 put it on powerful mode and we're gonna get a mean dry hit or very powerful hit so we have it on powerful now we're gonna wait five seconds and you'll know if it's in mode changing mode whatever you want to call it because the m2 will actually light up when you click it three times it'll light up white so whatever color background you have it'll change the m2 or the m1 or whatever em setting is at the top to white and then you hit the fire button to scroll to the next is the power and the next would be the soft standard or powerful setting as well as so on the rest of the menu there so we have it on powerful 60 watts right now that was a powerful hit it wasn't disturbingly powerful to wear like for the user it kicked you really hard I mean I'm not using a high nicotine at all it's a three milligram nicotine but that was a good warm hit for like a this is a desert flavor that I'm vaping so it really pronounces like the strawberry in this flavor this is really good do you think shucks this thing just shucks all in all I'm not sure that I've done this for any device that we've I just noticed something when I hit the fire button I'm powerful I watched the wattage goes from 65 to seventy three point three watts not sure that you guys can see that but when it is on powerful on standard it'll keep it at 65 I'm soft let's see doesn't change the wattage but it actually just has a slow ramp-up time so that's a pretty interesting thing brings it from sixty-five to seventy three point three watts that's a good powerful hit but it's powerful isn't like it's more of like a full hit like you get all that flavor it's really really good I mean if you guys pick up this device one I'd recommend picking up device but if you guys pick up the device definitely mess with these settings these are really really great settings they really put a lot of thought into this device here still very comfortable still very portable well like I said I'm not sure that I've ever done this for any other device that we've reviewed before but I would give this a 10 out of 10 this is a really really nice device the airflow is perfect the tank size is perfect it kind of matches a five point five mil ten to a 200 watt device makes sense cuz you'll be going through a lot of juice vaping it at around 65 to 75 watts there's a coil fest use between sixty and eighty ten out of ten device here honestly I I mean I can't I don't even know what else to say about it that's just a great device it was really well thought out I see little changes and things that are definitely improvements from the legend even if you already own the legend this is still a device I think that you would still enjoy which is very different from other companies who just put out device after device after device and only really changes like the look or the color or maybe some of the trim but not the actual function of the device this device I think is very very good for the intermediate to advanced vapor and I think that you definitely whatever this is priced at it'll be greatly prized heat vapor is generally priced very well and it's gonna be an enjoyable experience for anybody who picks it up but in all that is the aegis x kit and I really really enjoyed it and I think I'm just gonna keep vaping it for rest of the week so if you guys have any questions on the coils

cannabis product review today i'm reviewing something that i've had a lot of requests to review it's the pink kush 510 vape cartridge now this is from san rafael which is a brand under the license producer med relief which i believe is also co-owned by aurora cannabis which is a huge sort of cannabis brand license producer here in canada it retails on the ontario cannabis store for 32.95 and that's for 0.3 grams of cannabis oil so i want to do a little bit of math here that i think will help to clarify some of those numbers that you guys might see on the ontario canvas store and help you make better decisions about what to buy so if we break it down at 32.95 that's 10.98 per 0.1 gram of cannabis oil now to compare i did a review a little bit back on the marley natural black vape cartridge which i consider to be a very good quality cartridge and that retailed for 52.95 on the ontario cannabis store but it was for 0.5 grams of cannabis oil so if we break that down it was 10.59 per 0.1 gram so pink kush was 10.98 per 0.1 gram the marley natural was 10.59 per 0.1 gram now what's the range okay so what is a good price what is expensive so on the ontario cannabis store the range of uh prices that you see for these 510 cartridges is between 6.79 per point one gram at the lower end of the range and at the very high or high end of the range it's 12.99 per 0.1 gram so this falls somewhere in the mid to mid high range in terms of price point okay so hope that clarifies that point uh now pink kush is a strain of cannabis that is grown for san rafael by med relief i'm assuming and it's an indica dominant strain and it's very rich in terpenes um we'll talk about the flavor soon uh what else it uh i like this part on the description it's in the description on the ontario cannabis store it says contains no fillers and no dilutive agents okay so we know that it's a clean cannabis oil the percentage of thc in this one is 65.8 percent to 77.5 percent and they call that very strong a very strong product on the ontario canvas store in my opinion i would say that it's i my opinion differs a little bit i would say that it's a strong product but i've had very strong products and this is not a very strong product i would say this is a strong product it's not a weak product it's not very strong it's somewhere in the middle so i'm going to go into a little bit of my experience with this and then what i really want to do to kind of conclude everything is to compare this to the pink kush disposable pen which i reviewed previously uh let's first talk about flavor so i would give this full marks for flavor it was delightful it is floral it's fruity it really reminded me of elderflower i don't know if you've guys ever had like an elder flower like soda or something with elderflower in it but that's what this really reminded me of in terms of flavor the vapor was it's not the harshest vapor that i've had but it's also not the smoothest vapor i had it's somewhere in the middle uh in terms of the vapor quality the effects so the effects come on uh you know pretty soon after taking your first dose much like the all the other vape cartridges and in terms of how long it lasts same amount of time as most of the other vape cartridges you know i would say anywhere from like an hour to an hour and a half and then it slowly dies off after that so no major differences with this one compared to others in terms of onset of effect and duration of effect now the quality of the effects so i found this to be very calming and soothing and it doesn't have much of a body effect so there was a little little body effect with this one um the really sort of surprising thing for me was that i how unfoggy in terms of like my thinking it made me feel i was very much able to get work done uh while taking this so like at night time you know i'd have a dose and then i could still do some some work on the computer no problem with the marley natural black no chance that thing just knocks me on my feet i can't do anything except watch tv but this one i could actually kind of be productive which which i sort of like that's pretty much it for this i'd say like the biggest drawbacks uh for me was the fact that it didn't have much of a body effect uh i like a little bit of a body effect um and um yeah that's pretty much the only major drawback from this one what i really want to do now is compare this to the i think i've got it somewhere oh i didn't even show you guys what this all looks like okay so let me open this up so this is how it comes when you buy it in this box here with these tabs if you could see them there's two and it's a very similar system to some of the other cartridges you open the top like this you have to push in both tabs at the same time and that releases this plastic container inside which has your vape cartridge right there take that out here's the cartridge so you could see it's quite small it's smaller than definitely some of the other ones i've purchased because i think a lot of other ones are 0.5 grams and this one's a 0.3 gram but it's good to know that sort of price per 0.1 gram which which i talked about so here you go that screws into your 510 battery like so and then you're good to go now let's compare that to here's the pink kush disposable pen which i've reviewed before now the disposable pen retails for 27.95 on the ontario cannabis store but it only has 0.15 grams of oil this one has three double the amount and is it double the price no not even close this one if you remember 32.95 27.95 so we're talking like less than 10 difference and this contains double the amount of oil now quality not even close this one garbage this one very good that disposable pen in my opinion the quality of the vapor the flavor the effect total garbage for me it tasted like burnt oil um i just mainly got like a headache from it no major effects and i didn't even close to taste the nuances of the terpenes that i got with the 510 system so please if you're considering uh purchasing uh vape in general don't go for the disposable pens go for some sort of vape system like the 510 system or the pac system or buy yourself a good quality vaporizer that can do oils and dry flour don't go for the disposable pens they're overpriced the quality is garbage go for one of these okay so that's my piece on that now how am i going to rate this uh so in terms of so price point uh i think is on the money because i i liked it it was it was good quality and it's not on the higher end which i don't think it should be and it's not on the lower end which probably shouldn't be either maybe if they dropped the price a dollar or two i'd be a little bit more happy but uh price point pretty good flavor 10 out of 10 full marks for that effect um just shy of what i'd like it to be i really like that body effect really didn't have any of that body effect for me so i'm going to take off a mark on on the effect the quality of the effect and uh i think just one mark off i'm trying to think i'm trying to nitpick at this product uh other than that i really like it so um you know what i like i feel weird giving this a nine out of ten but like i'm inclined to give this a 9 out of 10 but there's something drawing me back so i'm going to be a little conservative and i'm going to give this a strong 8 and a half out of 10. overall a very good vape i liked it a lot and i hope you enjoyed that review so i'll see you next time for another cannabis product review", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can

with an estimated street value of 6 thousand dollars that's a ton of violence obviously this is not a personal use situation here we're doing with somebody who is clearly selling it on the street the vials are used in electronic vaping pens something law enforcement says is becoming a trend we're seeing a lot of younger people taking up vaping and it's very hard to detect what they're vaping in ruas initial court appearance he was described as someone with strong ties to the area was driving while suspended in an unregistered vehicle with no insurance reporting in Racine County Kristine evangelist Fox 6 News", "WLD7kW_uVEY": "- I don't know how any\nof this works at all. So, where do you put the fluid, why do you need power? I know nothing about this. - Yup, that's exactly what I thought. What the heck is a Juul? - What is a Juul? A Juul is a closed-loop vape system. It consists of a battery\nand a pre-filled pod. Pre-filled pod is filled with e-liquid with a high nicotine volume. A Juul is very easy to use, all you do is put the\npod in and vape away. - Lots of high school kids\nwould never think of smoking. They've grown up with anti-tobacco ads. - [Girl] With this contract, I relinquish part of my freedom, to you. - [Kavitha] The scary thing\nis they don't think of vaping as smoking a cigarette or as smoking. - [Boy] Vaping can deliver\nnicotine to your brain. - It is true that Juuls don't have a lot of the toxic chemicals\nthat say a cigarette has, but a tiny Juul pod has the\nequivalent amount of nicotine that's contained in an\nentire pack of cigarettes. So, why would kids Juul? - They love the flavors. - I've heard a lot of kids say like, just gives them a quick buzz. They feel good after they do it. - You see the younger celebrities, they're holding a Juul in their hand and everyone on Snapchat\nwill like post videos of them juuling. They just find it as a way to be cool. - If you have money, you\ncan get it super easy. Just ask anyone. - One of the things that makes\nit really hard for educators is that Juuls are really easy to hide. - So, if I'm a student\nand not dressed like this, but if I have a pocket or if I, I put it right here. - Juuls look so similar to\nsay thumb drives, right? It's really easy to get confused and of course, kids\ntake advantage of this. So, a lot of students told me about a game they play in class, where a student can go up to a teacher, who has no idea what a Juul is, and say hey, I've got my\npresentation on this thumb drive, can I charge it on your computer, please? Because, I really need to have it. And then, they go ahead\nand charge their Juul on the teacher's computer\nand teachers have no idea. - It's very tricky, it's\nmade to be very tricky, to trick us, so it's therefore\ndifficult as teachers to know if they're actually vaping. - So, what's a teacher to do? Here is some of the things you can look for in your classroom. - So, your typical high\nschool bathroom, right? - Frequent or long bathroom breaks. A lot of kids go to the bathroom and then they hang out juuling. In fact, it's become so common, that schools across\nthe country have either cut down on the number of\nbathrooms that are open, teachers may monitor the bathroom, sometimes even principals. - You might have five or six kids hanging out in here with\nthe door closed and vaping. - Watch out for kids who cover\ntheir face with their hands, who sometimes have sleeves\nnext to their nose, who put their head down often, and maybe they just hide,\nthey're teenagers, right? But it could be that\nthey're vaping in class. A principal I spoke to said one of the most\neffective methods he used was really involving parents. So, for example, he didn't just talk to\nkids about the problem, he had after school seminars\nwhere he would invite parents and then it grew even bigger, it wasn't just parents, he actually invited the entire community, so that there were lots of\nsets of eyes on his students. And parents are still really influential in their teen's life, I mean just listen to what this one kid, Zane, said to me. - My momma don't play that. (kids laughing) It's that simple. - [Kavitha] Your mom is a very smart one. - Yeah, my mom would kill me too.", "anZRXfHB_XM": "hi guys thank you for viewing in uh today's review is the fantasy ice orange e-liquid um which came along in the bundle um from vaporholic that i bought so i've been smoking the fantasy ice cola uh for the last six days now and i needed a bit of a change the colder one was really nice um i've been getting along with it with the vape quite well so yeah i thought let's give this orange one a little try out now and let you know how it all tastes really um so yeah i've already filled it up into my g proof baby again with the q2 coils 0.4 this e-liquid before i puff on it is a 70 70 percent i think uh 70 vg 30 pg and it's got no nicotine in it yep um i will eventually drop 10 ml 18 mg nicotine in there um so because i like my eliquids to be at least 3mg nicotine but yeah for the purpose of the review i'll try to keep it without the nicotine so it doesn't mess about the flavor at all so yeah um just to say that i've already saturated the liquid in my coil now and i'll take a little tag on it yeah this one's quite nice actually yeah so um straight away i can tell you that it tastes like orange um it's uh the flavor i can i don't know what to describe the flavors now uh yeah this is it it's like an orange sherbet so it tastes like an orange shirt but i'm not sure from my childhood days the only thing i can remember is okay if any of you guys have ever had these shirts where you've got one half which is like a strawberry or a cherry shell button and the other half which was a orange here but i think you i'm not sure whether it was nerds or so i can't remember what it's called but it tastes like an orange sherbet um the ice on it is pretty strong again on this one so it definitely does have a lot of menthol in there or coolada again i'm not sure but the smoke itself is quite smooth uh so yeah it doesn't it doesn't um hit the back of the throat as say like the colder one did um the colder one was very icy um i think like say after three pulls or so i could get i could taste the menthol and also the brain freeze element of it as well but um yeah this fantasy ice orange doesn't have the same sort of effect um it is a smoother smoke or smoother vape and it does taste like orange and to a certain extent uh i think personally i would have preferred it if it was a little bit more sweeter maybe but again it's it's but that's a personal preference some of you guys are they might enjoy it the way it is but uh yeah if i was going to review this thing or rate it i will give it a 6 out of ten so yeah six out of ten for the fantasy ice orange range um again if you guys are out in the market for an orange one i can recommend this one um it isn't that bad uh i know i've rated it six out of ten however um for my own tastes i prefer sweeter e-liquids so if this one was a little bit more sweeter i would have rated it a lot higher but yeah quick review done have a good night guys take care ciao", "pneymr1PpZU": "ONE ONE WAS ONE WAS THREATENED ONE WAS THREATENED WITH ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@ ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@\nWEAPON ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@\nWEAPON AND ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@\nWEAPON AND THE ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@\nWEAPON AND THE STUDENT ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@\nWEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED WEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED WEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED\nWAS WEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED\nWAS TAKEN WEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED\nWAS TAKEN INTO WEAPON AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED\nWAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

and they had a deal going on for tree-based clear it was buy one at $80 get another one for two bucks so I'd end up getting two grams of carts for about 82 bucks it's still a little bit expensive I could have gotten you know two grounds for 40 bucks if I had gone with a much different product but this year I'm kind of excited about because I've never gotten up so high in pricing yeah I'm trying to see if it's worth the tree baits clear we're gonna test you out uh-huh this particular one is the gelato as you guys have noticed it's at an 87 point 54 grams of total cannabinoids but the THC is 83 point 54 let's go ahead and taste this bad boy out Wow definitely you get into thick clouds out you can't even taste how thick that cloud is when you're inhaling though it's so smooth it's so gentle but once you start letting it out all you can just see how much you took in I could feel it in my chest it's really heavy in the chest it tastes great I could feel it I'm not too crazy but we're gonna go ahead and let it simmer for about a minute or two check it out if I was sweating like a pig it is because it is a hundred degrees in Long Beach but you have to hit it as hard too you could take it in like five six seconds and be on a good one and that's what I look for in a product I do look for the quality and the pricing if you're gonna buy a product that's really cheap then you know what you're getting but if you're gonna be paying eighty dollars for a gram cart it better be something amazing I've only hit this twice and already I fill it up here I'm calm and relaxed I did decide to go with the hybrid and the reason I chose that is because I wanted something that was gonna mellow me out and not push my anxiety further but at the same time I'm not looking for that couch look and finding that balance is a little difficult and hybrids are pretty close to it but I just feel there there is no perfect strain but this right here this is definitely something that I feel that I could take out and with those two pops I'm chilling you still can't control you're not too too high where you can't communicate very well I like this this is a really good product we have to test it out throughout the day check it out see how it hits tree base clear this is some good stuff I would definitely say try this is it worth the $80 so I finally had time to try out the tree base clear and I just got to say this is a whole different ballgame this is definitely not for beginners and at the price range $80 per gram this is gonna be a lot more expensive but you're gonna taste the quality you're gonna get the quality high you're gonna get that long-lasting feel I mean I was high for over like two three hours and if you go into cartridges thinking that they're all the same they're not sometimes it's not worth buying the extra expense but with this one you're going to what you pay for and it is nothing but goodness so try it out this is definitely like I said not for beginners if you are spending a hundred bucks a week or 100 bucks every other week and you're into cartridges this right here is one of the greatest options it's strong and it's just long lasting I've been hitting it and hitting it and it just doesn't seem to go down as fast as the other ones who are a lot cheaper because when they're a lot cheaper they're using a lot less quality cannabis so you have to hit it more and it just goes by so much faster tree base clear I gotta say you guys really outdid I'll did a lot of the game I'm very happy I think that you should all try this and if you got the money I would say keep this as backup always but nothing like flower flower is always gonna be the top notch but if you want to be discreet you want to get high and you want to enjoy the whole cartridge ease this is worth every penny I'm telling you guys try it out tree base clear I'm out", "7vpgJ80MjUs": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "UWD64bVxXto": "new data from the CDC shows the recent spate of vaping related illnesses may be linked to products that include THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana researchers interviewed 86 patients in Illinois in Wisconsin 87 percent of those people said they use THC vapes in the months leading up to when they got sick on Friday health officials said that while no single product has been linked to all cases there have been patterns involving cartridges with certain labels most prominently many of the cases were linked to products that said dank vapes on the label officials say dank vapes is a generic label THC sellers can put it on any product regardless of what it is or how it was made on Thursday the CDC said the death toll associated with vaping related illnesses is at least 12 it also updated the number of reported illnesses to 805 on Thursday up 52% from the week before while researchers have found links to THC products it's important to note that some patients have reported only using nicotine the CDC

All of this white cloudiness means there's a lot of\ninflammation in his lungs, and that's making it\nhard for him to breathe. So, what's making his\nlungs go from this to this? This patient is one in\nan exploding pattern of vaping-related lung illnesses. The exact cause of the\nillnesses is still unknown. We asked Dr. Melodi Pirzada\nat NYU Winthrop Hospital about treating patients affected\nby this growing outbreak, including the patient\nwith the inflamed lungs. - [Melodi] This is a 18-year old. - [Narrator] At first, she didn't connect his condition to vaping. Given the fact that this is so new, how were you able to figure it out? - We were lucky to have\nthe mom find the cartridge and bring it to us, and that's how we correlated\nvaping to his condition. - [Narrator] Many patients\nhave reported vaping THC oils, which come packaged in\ncartridges like these. These were given to Dr. Pirzada\nby her patient's family. Do you know where the patients are getting the cartridges to begin with? - They all say that their friend gave me, or, \"I was at a party and\nI just got my hands on it.\" We don't know where they are getting. - [Narrator] This\ncartridge tested positive for vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent some\nhealth officials suspect is behind many of the\nvaping-related lung illnesses. TKO Products, a legal manufacturer of\nTHC vapes in California, has learned that\ncounterfeits like this one exist all over the country. According to TKO, even the counterfeits are being\nknocked off on Chinese sites and sold in the US. Someone buying a TKO fake won't know if it was\nmade by the same people as the last one they bought. Our reporting shows that even in states where cannabis is fully legal, the black market is proving\nmore resilient than expected. Dr. Brian Strasnick's lab tests thousands of cannabis-containing products, including vaping oils, for\nsubstances like pesticides and bacteria before these can be sold legally in Massachusetts. Right now, there's a lot\nof interest in testing because of the current string of illnesses that have been related to vaping. Can you talk a little bit about\nyour tests in that context? - There's no mandate for\ntesting once the material is already in the\ncartridges, so we don't know what's in the cartridges, and I don't think anybody really does. - [Narrator] Health officials\nare warning consumers against buying products off the street. But according to our reporting,\nthere's also a booming market for fakes online, on\nAmazon, Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn. Why would people wanna cut a\nTHC oil with vitamin E acetate? - I think one of the reasons\nis that the consumers are under this impression\nthat the thicker it is, the more concentrated and the more potent, which is scientifically invalid. Vitamin E acetate or\npropylene glycol is a thick, very viscous-type substance. The consumer looks at it and says, \"It's thick, there's a bubble\nthere; it's gotta be more potent.\" That's not the case. - [Narrator] Propylene\nglycol and vitamin E acetate are common ingredients in\nproducts like cosmetics, processed foods, lotions,\nand dietary supplements. But when inhaled, these\nsubstances may interfere with the way our lungs work,\neven resulting in death. - If they are going to continue vaping, they should really stop THC vaping ASAP. - I think it's irrational to think that people are gonna stop vaping. My suggestion to people\nwould be if you can stop, do stop. If you haven't started, don't start. - [Narrator] In the wake of\nthe reported deaths, large retailers like Walmart have\nannounced that they will stop selling all E-cigarettes, and\npolicymakers like Governor Charlie Baker in Massachusetts\nhave similarly responded by ordering a temporary ban on\nall vaping products in the most sweeping prohibition on\nE-cigarettes in the US. - I have a 20-year-old daughter. She said, \"Of course,\nMom, everybody is vaping.\" When I said, \"Why do you think that is,\" her answer was, \"Because\nteenagers think they are invincible it's not\ngoing to happen to them. It just happened to\nanother another person, but not to them.\"", "4prSaPMylLQ": "high design is cannabis parade with more reviews for you today and today I would like to talk about some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "_1Y1Slthtlo": "[Music] well if you like the aegis mod from geek vape but you thought the screen was just too penny well check this out it's the aegis ex [Music] [Applause] welcome to the vapor trail channel I'm Tony and today we are looking at the geek vape Aegeus X now this is the latest edition of the ages as a lot of the hallmarks of the original ages waterproof dustproof and all that but look at that big giant gorgeous screen this might be the most beautiful screen that I've seen on a vape yet I mean it's not like a Retina screen or anything like that but yeah that's big and beautiful and it's it's easy to see just about anywhere I'm at look what I'm using today comes from distilled they get that name because it's literally distilled what they do is they take all the different ingredients and they distill them before they create the e-liquid so any kind of alcohol or any byproducts you know stuff a lot of the flavorings that we use are made for like candies and stuff like that and they use alcohol as a stabilizer and whatnot and it doesn't really agree well with a liquid 's and flavors you know in the end so what they do is basically mega steep it by distilling it first you may know them also as cali vape co they did the berry crunch time and crunch time and all that stuff that i love they've rebranded and relabeled and all that stuff and it looks really good this one's Catalina and it is an organic watermelon with pineapple and kiwi exits now before we go any further I've got my camera down here pretty low and I can't really raise it right now but this is what they sent this thing in and it's just it's a it's a big lock box and it's got two of these in here I'll probably be able to use this for something else I mean that's pretty cool but yeah they were both in here like this a couple of Tanks they've got all of your instructions and stuff up here now that's just a promo or a marketing thing but you know they're known for doing that stuff geek vape and this is probably one of the more impressive promo kits that I've gotten so basically if you get a kit you're gonna get the tank you're gonna get the mod you'll get a manual inside there and the manual is actually pretty easy to understand and use it looks pretty thick but it's really only a couple of pages per language content so if you get the kit I'm sure you could buy the mod by itself and then you've got some parameters down here some specifications I'm gonna read those go ahead and pause it or leave them up for a second and a continuation of this five to 200 watts of course it does have temperature control and all that stuff so there we go okay we got a little box and I imagine that the retail packaging will be similar to this inside of that you've got a standard microUSB and you can do updates with it an extra glass for the tank this one's a straight glass and this one that's on here is a slight bubble it's not a big bubble got X Oh rings for the tank and then these are extra parts for the mod itself you've got a couple extra screws in here and an extra plug for where the USB is right here so that's where your USB is gonna be it's way down in there and since we're there I might as well show you it's got some rings around it and it does seal in there pretty tightly so that does plug that up real good if you have a wider tank on here you might have to remove the tank before you can get access to that you really should be charging your batteries externally so you know that's why it's not the most practical of charging ports but that's really not what it's meant for it's meant for upgrades then you're gonna get an extra coil in there and this coil is a mesh coil nice big fat mesh inside of there 20 to 80 Watts best at 60 to 80 watts and this is Kanthal 0.2 Ohm's it's mesh x1 I'm not gonna get into the tank too much it's the Cerberus and we've had this here on the channel before it's you know it's a standard sub ohm tank it works well probably not the best tank out there this airflow rings a little bit loose on this I like them to have a little bit more attention on it you know just take out the base take out the coil same thing as we see on a lot of stuff one thing that is nice about this and let me close this airflow for this haven't adding a leaking but if you start removing the top with juice in there and stuff you might so that's why I closed the airflow let's just open that up it's just a quarter turn to open it up and you've got to fill holes there but the real star of the show is the mod and your 510 is centered on there this fits on there just nicely like that now it's gonna ask you if it's new coil because I just put one on there and you're just gonna say yes and it's read the coil at 0.18 ohms and while this is centered it almost doesn't look Center because you got this angle right here and it's just but you know if you like centered five tens it's about as close to Center it is you're gonna get down here at the bottom it's kind of like a brushed metal look on this right here of course you've got the rubber casing all the way around on this thing now I have heard people saying that when the display was over here they did get liquid into the display the chip on this is not waterproof so if you don't have this thing completely locked down and water gets in there it you know it's still going to damage the chip so there's a just right there on the bottom up and down buttons I like the angles on those buttons that's nice and then you've got your fire button it's kind of curved in if you could see that right there this seems to be aluminum right here and then you've got the leather on here and it's kind of padded leather now as far as the battery door goes you got to push down push back on this and you can open it up dual 1860's course your positive and negative or marked in there as well as on the door so you just put your batteries in and the corresponding way and when you close the door you kind of got to push down you got to lock it in there and then push over there once you get it locked in there it's good and this screen being as big as it is does get some fingerprints on it so we're gonna click five times on the fire button one two three four five and it just launches up like that and there is your display got batteries listed up there at the top this is on memory 3 power standard that's what kind of mode we're in right now your wattage is shown right there your coil right there puffs are down there those are resettable amps and your voltage so this is saying zero point one seven ohms now so if you push the up and down buttons at the same time and hold them it will lock the screen and then these are locked but this can fire and then if you push down on them again and hold them you've got to hold it for a little bit and then it unlocks now because this thing has so much reflection I got so much light and stuff going on in here I got to hold it at a weird angle hopefully that doesn't bother you too much if you hit the UP button and the fire button then you can adjust your brightness and if you hit the down button in the fire button you can adjust it down if you don't want to use up your battery with that big bright screen which it doesn't seem too bad especially with dual batteries then you'll hit all three buttons at the same time and now the screen is off but it still fires hit all three buttons at the same time and hold them and your screen will come back if you want to switch through the modes just three clicks on the fire button one two three and then you'll see that that's highlighted at the top and you can switch through the memory modes when you get to the one that you want to be on power standard I'm just gonna hit the fire button now you'll see the power is highlighted and you can rotate through the difference you can set up a curve which I've set one up there oh you got bypass you've got stainless steel and you know that's temp control and TCR all-in-one and then back to power so you've got all the different temp control modes and then you can hit the fire button again to advance to the next thing you can choose standard powerful soft I like standard and then you're going to the next one which is coil which I'm not going to adjust that and then your puffs if you want to research puff counter just hit the up button and it's reset then you can push and hold and everything will be unhhhh highlighted and you're ready to go also in that mode one two three now that you're in that mode if you hold down the up and down buttons at the same time then we're going to get into a menu you've got auto up there you've got theme here if you go to the theme you can change your themes if you want to use one of the different themes I just like the one that came with it it looks good color you can go in there and change your colors I personally like the one that was on they're going to get it version tells you your version and everything your battery you can turn that off if you want to the battery a and B I'm not exactly sure what that does you can turn it off or you can leave it on or you can you know there's I don't know really because the manual doesn't exactly explain that it really doesn't explain what the Ottawa is either so one two three and we're gonna go back to memory too and yeah I'm good there but interestingly enough it doesn't really explain what that auto is or what the a B&B is so I'm not exactly sure but you know for most people they're gonna get in here they're gonna set their wattage on it and they're gonna be like cool I'm done maybe lock the up and down buttons or something like that but other than that I you know that's gonna be what people are gonna do a little bit taller and fatter than some mods I'm not comparing it to other mods though I'm just looking at this I will compare it to previous ages though and yeah this has got to be the best ages that they've done probably the best mod that geek vape is done if you don't mind all this rubber stuff and tell you when you're trying to put something like this in your pocket this stuff always catches and stuff but if you need a mod that can drop the only thing is so this mod is supposed to be crush proof and all that stuff once you put this big display on the face of it yeah that's probably out the window so there we go that is the geek vape Aegeus X so the first thing I'll say is that that Wow that is quite a promo item right there I mean it's a whole you know hard case type thing might actually use it for one of my handguns or something like that I mean you know so it's a pretty cool little thing and it kind of denotes security and strengths the only thing that I see with this that okay the aegis is known for being a super strong mod well once you take the entire face of it and put a display on there like that well that's you know it's a potential point of failure if you're buying it for that reason now some of the previous ages they did have some leaking around the screen which if water or any kind of liquids get into the actual mod it can damage the board because the board itself is not waterproof perhaps the way they've done the screen on this we'll help because it seems like the rubber overlaps the screen and all Aiko stuff I don't really know but I do know this thing is completely coated in rubber it seems to me like it's right in line with the rest of the ages products if you like the ages you're probably gonna like this I don't know the screen it's just so darn big now I change the display because I use a green screen here and all that green would probably just look really funky on here I really like the display that you know the theme that they have on there when you get it but they do have theme choices and all that kind of stuff but boy that's like having an iPhone or something like that it's it's a big big screen now luckily you can turn that off if you want to go stealth and not have everybody see that like oh I got a big speedometer and display on my mod you know that kind of thing it does work well though and I will have to say that this is out of the ages that I've seen it's the best-looking and it yeah I don't know the functionality of is really good it's easy to navigate and all that kind of stuff so if you're an ageist fan and you want to have the dual batteries then you might like this one quite a bit now this tank the Cerebral it's the Cerberus yeah this tank has been around for a while they've used it in a couple of different kids I don't know that they've updated the tank it's you know it's a good sub ohm tank it's probably not the best sub ohm tank I've ever had but you know it's it for a kit tank it works well you're gonna get to mesh coils with this yeah I like mesh coils especially single coil mesh coils they work really well got all that surface area the mesh against the cotton to create flavor and vapor the mod doesn't maybe the mod doesn't feel quite as heavy as some of the previous ages but it is it's still it's a heavy mod this is not a lightweight mod it's made of zinc alloy with rubber coating so it does lend to it being pretty heavy not so much a mod that you're gonna slip into your pocket all the time because you know this rubber stuff it always kind of catches on your clothes you know it kind of sticks to them and because if you put it in your pocket it's like boom man it's really waiting down your pocket it does fire really fast and I mean that display is just gorgeous on this thing it looks really really good I guess the question is do you need a display that's that big and iPhone like you know it does produce really big clouds and from distilled this Catalina it says pretty darn tasty sometimes when it comes to melon and a liquids I'm like and just a weird taste with the melons but they'd have a good job at this it's organic watermelon with pineapple and kiwi accents and I really think that Cali vape Co has done a great job rebranding it makes sense it's got a nice non child appealing label to it and let's face it adults like flavours man that's the bottom line I don't typically go into the store and go nope I got to get cereal with no flavor in it I don't go to the to the Powerade section ago is there Powerade with no flavor in it I think you get what I'm saying this stuff has gotten really ridiculous it's not just flavor bands now there's a couple states that have just outright banned it and you know banned it for four months listen four months is all it's gonna take to ruin the businesses that are there that are doing the vaping stuff I'm really saddened in my heart for all these guy have friends that have basically lost their business in New York they're saying a 90 day ban 90 days is all it's gonna take to ruin that business and taking food off of their plates is just unacceptable I have links down in the description by the way for advocacy and I do encourage you to read those contact the organization's become members of them and do what you can but yeah this liquid is very good and the reason why it's called distilled is because they actually distill all the ingredients before they make the liquid so takes all that steeping out of it and it just makes the flavor so much better that's what got me out of the flavor thing yeah I mean it works really well if this is what you're looking for if you like the ages and you want something that you know is supposed to be dust proof I don't know about crushproof with this thing anymore because if you run over this with a cart that's a big big area of display that could get damaged but I'd say dust proof and a lot of proof it still fits that I did test this by dropping it into a glass of water baked it afterwards it did work just be wary because again the board inside of here is not waterproof so if anything does get inside the mod somehow it's still gonna fry it overall I'd say that geek vape did a good job with this and aside from the fact that it's not really crush proof anymore and you got all that display that could get broken it's probably the best ages that they've done so far man I'm so I'm really pleasantly surprised that I like this Catalina because I saw watermelon and said nope it's got melon in it I'm not gonna like that hey I want to thank you so much for your support here on the channel likes comments shares subscriptions always very important to

trail channel the page not a group or anything like that that's where I'm daily updating links as far as advocacy stuff goes it's just it's insane right now I I'm speechless I don't really know what to say because I don't have all the information I'm not as tied in as somebody like a grim green or even Matt from suck my mod and somewhat reserved but I'm doing my part in the background I'm writing letters I'm making calls I'm taking interviews with the media so far only a couple of outlets have used it including the Washington Post but I mean you know we're all trying to do our part and the best thing you can do is get yourself educated and use those links that are down there at the bottom of the description I've said it before I'll say it again you got to educate yourself so you can educate others do it in a calm fashion so they don't see you is just some kind of raving lunatic calmly explained to them that this is what we need to stay off of cigarettes and we want it to be around for other people that are currently smokers to have an alternative that is safer and you know claims that I make I'm just passing on from stats that I get from public health UK and from the Royal College of Physicians it's a it's 95 percent safer they even put vape shops in their hospitals over there but we know why it's different here because if you look up the MSA the master settlement agreement that's the problem here it's all about the money I'm gonna get off the soapbox that's going to do it for this episode we'll catch you next time on the vapor trail Channel", "OWg8S1qBciI": "the easiest way you can get your medical card 29 glorious states and the District of Columbia now have laws that broadly legalized cannabis in some form but the majority of the states still require would be legal smokers to receive medical marijuana recommendations from a licensed physician before entering those golding dispensary gates if you're having visions of your 80 year old family doctor freaking out when you asked him about toking up don't fret just yet getting your med card doesn't have to be a headache here are the fastest and easiest ways you can get a license to light up first let's check out the old-school way the traditional way that we'd patients can get an MMJ card is by visiting a 420 doctor in person if you choose to go the IRL route there are many downsides if you live in an area where medical MJ doctors are hard to come by you could face long wait times rushed consultations sketchy locales and ridiculous fees also note that in many states getting a local weed card allows anyone including potential employers to search databases of ID's to find out if you use cannabis so not exactly fitting if you enjoy a little thing called privacy so now you may be thinking to yourself there's got to be a better way well there is it's a hundred percent legit and it's right on the internet in the last few years there's been an influx of online services that will screen individuals for cannabis use by connecting doctors with patients using video chat sites and apps like hello MD ease MD and nug MD have physicians available to discuss how marijuana can benefit your health and get you smoking sometimes as soon as that same day typically users are asked to submit basic information such as their address state ID and relevant medical history before being connected to a doctor via chat or video call after completing the online visit patients will receive a digital copy of their letter of recommendation which they can use to order weed as a treatment for their medical condition or ailment a couple days later clients receive hard copies of their letters in the mail which are valid for one year the best part the pricing is completely affordable usually ranging from about forty to sixty dollars depending on shipping and other options you might choose and if you already have your medical card but it's time for a renewal these services have you covered for that as well so if you have 10 minutes to spare and want to drastically improve your health and life with the joys of cannabis join the 1.5 million people currently boasting their weed card you don't even have to leave your house to do it [Music]", "TEVwniV1vxc": "hey Fox you asked us to repeat our experiment but with a wave and we made it we got this wave and we have to modify it with our device like last time inside the tube we'll put a piece of cotton that was weighed before experiments we need to vaporize this kind of big jar and it has yellowish colour and 0% nicotine that is according to many people almost harmless fill our reservoir and gather our setup were the same working principle compressor sucks air which passes through cotton and comes out lounge compressor and start our experiment whip instantly feels in bulb starts to settle on it and condense onto walls quite fast we finished with first revealed and let's check the condition of our lungs on the walls we can notice accumulation of liquid and also a lot of small drops inside the condition of cotton at the moments really hard to see and let's continue during these manipulations we noticed one unpleasant thing about this wave it tends to settle on surroundings living rate which won't evaporate but it doesn't smell that much so it's up to you with all this hassle evaporating whole soup of liquids we spent a day and now let's check it out condition of improvised lungs we can see that carton changed its color a little bit probably because of dyes but it's nothing compared with cigarettes get that cotton and wait and it got extra 30 grams which is half of a liquid from jar which left in our lungs unfortunately I'm not a scientist and I don't know how safe it is to have this much of liquids inside the human body but based on my observations I think that given a choice between regular cigarettes and electronic according to condition of cotton I would still choose second one because it seems less harmful in the last video many of you guys wrote that lungs clean after something gets there yes sure but they don't have time if a human leaves these deposits every hour even if our lungs

"now a KXAN news in-depth report it's one of the most powerful weapons local schools have to catch children doing drugs drug dogs can sniff lockers and cars even backpacks and purses without a reason it's all free game as long as students are not wearing them a mother though is now questioning the effectiveness of those dogs after her daughter was singled out kxan erin cargile has been digging into the story for months trying to figure out just how useful the canines are easy easy Krakow is ready good boy hey go hip-hop chica the mission sniff out drugs the place the student parking lot at Anderson high school he's more accurate than any scientific equipment out there he and his handler Austin ISD police officer Tony Andrew check the cars huh okay then move inside look trying to find the five cents this golden retriever is trained to detect meth heroin cocaine marijuana and gunpowder seats the search doesn't turn up anything but the district says it's drug sniffing dogs are successful more than half the time not surprising to Bowie high school sophomore and an amber C know so what did you say drugs are a problem in at your high school yeah probably half the school does it the 16 year old wanted to surprise her boyfriend with homemade brownies the chocolate never made a pass first period during a random classroom search drug dogs picked up on a scent officers thought was pot and they were like are these your brownies and I was like yeah they are my brownies and they said did you do anything special to these brownies and I was like no ana says she was taken to the office and questioned by school police who called and his mother she was just totally frightened and they had asked her questions like do you do drugs does anybody at your home do drugs I tried to tell the policeman I said well what dog would go for the brownies and so he said no these dogs are trained and there's no way that they would ever be attracted to the chocolate police sent the brownies to the lab for testing but as far as Anna's mother was concerned the damage had been done you can get on Facebook and ruin a kid's reputation and nothing flat by you know talking about them and I think that it's irresponsible and hurtful to take a child a policeman to take a child out of a classroom and you don't even know if that child is guilty or innocent I had some people that were like wow and it's a STONER I didn't know that about her I was like oh I'm not I'm a good person Phyllis after two and a half months the results were in turns out the brownies were drug free yeah I mean it's like tell me something I don't know I'd much rather see a social worker in in school than a dog walking the halls we wanted to know just how useful are they according to a ISD last school year the canines made 211 trips to campuses and detected drugs 138 times so far this year the dogs have made 66 campus visits and found drugs 38 times I think it's a very effective tool because all the stuff my dog has found wouldn't have been found if we he wasn't in school officer Andrew says the brownie situation is extremely unusual sometimes dogs have bad days and that that day a dog had a bad day we identify that as an issue and that will be fixed now Rocco is one of two AISD drug dogs at one time they had five but have had to retire a couple recently due to medical issues and they're not cheap a drug dog can cost the district between seven and ten thousand dollars that includes sending the officer off for training with the dog now other local school districts that don't have their own Police Department call on help from other agencies with drug dogs Erin Cargile KXAN news", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "2Z1Nu7VQ5ak": "all right so this is our terpene distillation unit start here with the heat mantle goes to the boiling flask you're gonna have your material class cars is already loaded with lime peels and a little bit of rosemary it's gonna go right in there a little steel what steel mesh filter inside from that take this top youtube over here to the graham condenser the graham condenser your water and terpene mix will go through the coil while the pull the fluid goes on the outside the coil from your condenser you go down here to your boiler water separator the oil will stay on top while the water goes to the bottom and it will siphon out through the side into a separate cup and then you'll try to keep it little water as possible in the actual tube and then you can siphon the water or I drain the water first before you drain your terpenes this is one of our newer chillers this is a 5 liter BWR - Oh 5a it's a negative 20 Celsius version we have the inlet and outlet ports here your inlet port will go to the bottom of your condenser and the outlet port goes to the top of your condenser this will ensure there's no air bubbles or anything inside the condenser while she was running through turn on the unit we need to start up screen let's start eating because it's too far from your set temperatures here's it's a hair of the silence that when the alarm features in the unit so our temperatures already set to zero degrees Celsius so we're going to first we're going to start the circulation and seeing the condenser it's going to fill up rather quickly now we're just running water through because we don't need to go too deep in temperature values and then we died a bully just for easy demonstration purposes now let's start cooling with your chiller you're just going to hold the cooling button until the run cymbal pops up on the left under the set there we go now India is ready they'll kick on you the compressor start you can go ahead and cap off your bill area we start extracting guys you can see our water started boiling a few minutes ago it turned a little bit of color because the steam goes into a lime peels and it's not hot enough it obvious through yet so it dips a little neck down that's not a big deal they'll go up and through the system eventually see our chiller is down the temperature set just over one one degree Fahrenheit I'm sorry Celsius nothing's left to get but we have pre-loaded our oil-water separator they do that just so we make sure that yeah water is being siphoned out rather than terpenes onto Vardhan being siphoned out before it's enough water so you can see our chiller we have ice buildup in water that shows that the chiller really did keep up with the temperature and set it to zero degrees Celsius which is the freezing point of water this killer really holds up well to steam as opposed some other killers that we tested right now we're gonna get rid of most of the water in this thing just open it up and let it drain out now while reading this out we want to make sure they're not like any of the terpenes through the stopcock it's okay to keep some water in the flat we will show you a video on how to further separate it later all right", "NiQhENt7DJY": "[Music] what's up peeps my type see it today I have a 200 watt kit device set up to show you guys and this one right here was sent to me for the purpose of this review from geek vape it is the Aegis X 200 watt kit comes with the Cerberus yeah I know I'm butchering the name it's part of the routine baby the Cerberus sub ohm tank mic that looks like a legend on one side yeah that's the point that's why it's called the X it looks like the legend but then as you turn it around you have a 2.4 inch o LED display but mike is that like one of those mods that's waterproof shockproof dustproof well that's what they say it is but uh we'll see should we do a test should I like destroy this mod I was thinking about doing it I was talking about doing a test on this to destroy it but tell you guys the truth I'd rather give it to somebody in need and that's what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna do what I was trying to destroy test I'm pretty sure it's gonna stand up through time but uh the only that worries me is it is a big display it is plastic pretty this that's a plastic cover that's on there but if you were to like smash it on something but that's see that's not realistic you're not gonna take your mod and smash it on an accidental drop you'll be fine which I'm gonna do right now ok you'll be fine with it the device all of it was it powered off and it's working and looking at it I have no cracks no dents no burrs nothing going on with it so let's not waste any time let's dive down let me show you guys the kit everything you get I'm gonna show you guys what they sent me they send me this beautiful reviewers package yeah it's beautiful and this is not a retail packages just for reviewers so let's do that let's dive down let's check out the ages X bi geek vape alright guys and here's the sample packaging the reviewer packaging that geek vape sent me and guys this is not the retail packaging this is just a promotional item they send me the suitcase you can see they're a nice little handle going on there where we call these Pelican cases I think that's what they're called Pelican cases open it up I'll give you guys the same experience I had opened it up and inside there says geek vape we got two sub ohm tanks here which is the Cerebus guys know that Sarah bus subong tank two mods and then on the top side they're over here we're gonna have two little boxes for each we're just gonna have to use in manual you know what let me show you guys what's in there so inside there there was this little envelope and that envelope contained a little warning card little advertisement promo thingy ages solo and then the other side ages X and I think warranty info here yes so inside that little box we did have a micro USB charging cable slash firmware upgrade cable user manual Oh rings this is a plug a spare plug for your charge port and some extra screws a spare glass for the tank and a spare coil so like I showed you guys before you do get the set service Cerberus cerebus sub ohm tank nice tank I've done a full review on this in the past awesome tank it's got nice mesh coils really like these mesh coils from geek vape and here is the ages X so dual eighteen sixty two hundred watt 2.4 inch oh LED display on top here we do have our 510 will fit up to a 28 millimeter without an overhang we have our micro USB port which is here this is the extra as I was showing you that they supply you pop that open and that's where you could either charge it which I don't recommend using it to charge but for firmware upgrades that's where you would do it we have our fire button up and down button Aegis branding we got this nice aluminum outside almost looks like it's got like wood grain going on there brushed finish which is real nice the rubberized all around this is ip67 rated you can see when you do turn it on the backside it does look like the original legend which I'll put it right there to get a basic idea and for a size comparison there are about the same exact dimensions and just like the original has that like leather thingy going on here it's nice soft to the touch the frame itself this one here is the green color it's gonna come in a bunch of different colors there's the bottom designed by geek vape battery door simply do one of these and there you go pops right open we have positive and negative marked right there on the door the inside as you can see there we do have positive and negative marked for your battery orientation and here's one with batteries in it so you get a basic idea with batteries this also has some protection all around because it is a waterproof mod and you just push it down like that and it's locked in place so display one two three four five powers of device on alright let's do a little zoom in on here there we go so as you can see there we do have our battery indications we have our wattage power standard m1 I'm gonna show you guys all different thing that you could do in here scrolling we have our resistance voltage amps puff counter now obviously the power this device off you're gonna do five clicks the power off now if you press the up and down button at the same time you will lock the device you'd see it's locked you're gonna see a little lock symbol don't have to worry about changing the wattage but I could still I can still fire the device and obviously when you press them again keep them pressed down you'll unlock it like it is right now now if you press the fire button up on and down button at the same time you will go in stealth mode well you could still fire it but your screen will be just the way you see it now clicking a fire button three times you see em one just got highlighted you have M 2 M 3 and M 4 so you could do three different modes and you customize them alright so I got an M one right now press the fire button again power just got highlighted you have power here you have TC RS titanium TCR nickel stainless steel TCR you have a bypass mode over here you could do custom curves and then back to power press the fire button again see I'm in standard powerful you got soft and then back to standard press it again your resistance and over here you could reset your puff counter and to get out of this just don't do nothing and you can see m1 will go right back into the original color which is just it now and I could fire away now to get deeper in the menu system you're gonna click the fire button three times 1 2 3 it's on a highlight press the up and down button at the same time keep them pressed and you're gonna have this section here so you have Auto theme color version a BB and reset so all though is you could do auto or off that's when you put an atomizer on new atomizer on it I'll ask you for the same resistance and so forth scroll down we have theme click on that so you have this theme here this one or that one okay that's where I have it at next thing you do is color so you could change the colors inside there pretty cool put it back to where I had it press the fire button again next thing you do is you have your version firmware off or on that's for your battery and then you could reset the device scroll down and reset it and not to get out of this simply just do nothing just leave it like that and there you go now when scrolling it does do it in point 1 increments keep it pressed and you could see that'll speed up and go into 1 watt increments and it goes up to 200 watts you can see there and then you could Ron Robin so we do have a round robin feature with this alright guys and that was the 200 watt age is X by geek beep let's go back up on top let's vape on them and I'll give you guys my thoughts and there you have it the up-close ages x geek vape Mike your thoughts on this one ok my thoughts on this one I'm loving it I think it's an awesome mod the display on this thing is beautiful it's nice a big vibrant I could see everything it's an awesome looking mod alright oh I'm jumping into pros Mike what about cons the only kind of have with this would have to be kind of wish the menu system was a little bit and the easier side you need to remember click three times press up and down buttons to get inside the menu system yeah I kind of wish there was a way that they have made it a little bit simpler maybe four clicks of the fire button brings you into that menu system would have been easier that way that's it that's really the only complaint I have other than that if the device function wise functions beautifully the device fires right away I like that the on the platform I could put up to a 28 millimeter without overhang 510 is in the center charge port easy access to it for charging what I don't recommend charging it but for firmware upgrades but in an emergency you need to charge it it's easy access to get into it the battery door is nice and solid on here love the battery door as you guys saw in the beginning of video I dropped the ground batteries did not come flying out so it's gonna get a big pro it feels good in the hands and have to give them a pro now one thing about this is if you're a righty and you like to use your index finger the fire the display will be in your hand but if you are thumb fire the way I am display will be facing you now if you're a lefty obviously it's gonna be the opposite if your thumb fire you're covering so yeah it's one of those situations with this mod just something worth mentioning another prominent I like that they actually added where I could do three at least a few different wallpapers in the air which is a pro I can change the colors up inside here which is a pro device is pretty nice they I think they did a pretty good job with this I love the way it feels in my hand it feels like a legend feels like the legend with just a brand new chipset which they've had and that's gonna have to be a pro to the chipset but like I said the only thing I kind of wish instead of me clicking the button 3 times click the up and down button to get inside that menu system I'd rather have been maybe four clicks to get in there three clicks to be able to change the one thing in the menu system for for the other menu system and then five clicks the turn of the vise off I think would have been a little bit of a simpler process well they're not geek vape you guys did a good job with this one very nice device and I like it you know some of us out there we are older you know not only young people vape older people late and some of us older folks have bad eyesight and with this one here I see everything beautifully which is a big Pro in my book Mike how much and who's selling it don't know how much who's selling it you can have to do your research check out Element vape comm vapor DNA comm they should have them soon in stock if you are in China having gifts should have them also use coupon code a MV 15 on having gifts I'm sure that coupon code is still working that's it I think I pretty much covered everything for this device or for people asking yeah that's the intake duel that I'm using on top of there yeah buddy so before we sign off from this video down below in the description I do have links for advocacy make sure contact your governor your Senators your president send emails file

not allowed it's a YouTube policy just my links down below as always sir thank you a number [Music]", "uBkFE3tlh8I": "[Music] everyone welcome back to our Channel and today we have the new edgy stakes box what by geek made it's 200 18 650 month with the big colorful screen as you can see and as a kid it comes with the Cerberus tank with the mesh words and at this video we're going to be doing the unboxing well quickly go over the device I will show you how to navigate it or will fill up the tank and then go back on top and wave it so let's dive down now and this is the packaging the new edgy specs kit by geek wave comes in on the side to have the name on the back we'll have some features of it package contains scratch and check part social media of the Ghibli let's open the box and here's our month I decided first and at the bottom we have the servers tank with the pre-installed coil now check this little box and in this box we have the USB micro USB port plug for the mod and some screws for that here we have some o-rings for the tank USB to micro USB cable to charge the battery and upgrade the firmware we have the spare glass cube for the tank and the sterile oil and here at the bottom of the box we have the protective film for the mod we have the user manual for the kit in the little envelope which contains warning cards warranty card and some formal card and here's the new edges Xbox mutt and by the look of it we can tell that the gig vibe kept overall appearance of their super popular edges legend mod then it's still dual 18 650 200 watt output device but now we have the large 2.4 inch colorful display on the side so let's do side by side with the edges legend model then the size of the mods is almost identical as you can see the mods are same tall the depth is almost the same it's just the XX is a little bit less white and the sides are more smoothed out and from this perspective they looks very similar this metal frame and leather part we don't have the Aggies name on the frame here and if we turn it over we have the display here and here we don't the displays here then on the top we have the connector part right in the middle and it should fit up to 28 millimeters diameter autumn eyes errs or at least 26 will be no problem this edges the 24 will go right through this metal edges but you still have the rubber cover here and here we have the USB micro USB port for charging and updating the firmware as well with this piece rubber cover and the front plate here we have the fire button and wattage of wattage down buttons eggy's here and the whole mod is covered with this rubber protector and it has ip67 great water and fire shock resistance as the all eggy series mods at the bottom we have the same battery cover system as on the edges legend with the venting venting holes here now let's open it up like so and we have the battery orientations inside and on the cover as well so now let's throw in the batteries here the positive goes up and here the negative goes up and it is five clicks to turn on the mod one two three four five here we have the logo and look at this large colorful screen we have the battery bars on both sides for two batteries we have the mode where all now we have the wattage here it goes up to 200 watts maximum and it does round-robin here we have the coil resistance we have the voltage output amps and your half counter and to change the modes it's three clicks one two three here we have four memory modes m1 to m4 and to continue press the fire button here we can switch to VB see its core power output bypass temperature control for nickel titanium and there was stainless steel at the beginning here we have a key CR and back to power and press one more time the fire button here we can switch the modes of the power output powerful soft and standard let's just leave it at the standard here you can lock your coil resistance if you press the down button and we can also reset the puff counter and if we go to curve mode we can set the time of each curve for example one second here which also can set the resistance to lock it resistance and choose the wattage for each curve and for the second one as well and for the third one and so forth and to say if you just long press the fire button and same goes for the temperature control here we can lock the resistance as well and you can choose the wattage maximum wattage and long press the fire button to save it now let's go back to power mode and in the mode selection press up and down buttons together so you can enter the screen menu here we have some themes you can choose we have three in total we can choose five colors for the themes the software version battery display of the battery and we can reset the settings and if you press fire button and wattage top or down buttons you can adjust the brightness of the screen just like oz has gone the other eggies mods and if you press these buttons together wattage up wattage down you can lock the screen but you still still can fire it now it's on bucket and if you press three buttons together you can go into the stealth mode just turn off the screen and you can still fire and the kit comes with the server Saban tank with the cantle mesh coils and I'm sure you guys already familiar with it here's the coil so let's prime it now we're going to be using the delicious vanilla para and tobacco ages by flavor ethic so don't forget don't forget to prime your coil first when you swap in the new coil or starting a new tank to prevent dry burning it put it back together make sure it's tight now let's fill up the tank oh here we go we're done here so let's go back on top that's right let's leave it and we are back on top with the brand-new Eddie stanky bike equipped with the server some time on top of it so it's time for a close check I have it on 76 what and fully open the air flow let's have a bit and as you can see the vapor production is on point and same goes with the flavour mesh coils can top mesh coils on the stand doing a really great job and the mod itself has some weight in it and it's to be expected with all this shot proof and waterproof fissures and I think for me it's not really necessary to test those features because the geek web has good reputation when they say his mods when it comes to that a lot of people already tested that and I'm sure this mod will survive some regular Falls and then drowning in the water it should be no problem with that in a hand it feels like like the edge is legend but it more comfortable to hold it because all these edges are more smooth for this new mat and with this large and colorful screen it looks more modern and more futuristic in my opinion another great job by equip and it's time to

let's say a heart medication that we have to make for a baby like a lot of times we work with pediatric cardiac units in hospitals and you know a little baby might have you know a heart disease or a cardiac condition and they might require a medication that is not obviously made at a dose that a baby would use either in the strengths and milligrams or in the appropriate form to give to the baby so our technicians and our pharmacists who work here at town and country compounding will actually formulate that medication say into a suppository that mom or dad can give to the baby that way or it might be a flavored liquid that they can put into the bottle or we have special nipples that you can put the medication into you know that baby's used to sucking the pacifier you can put the medication into the pacifier and those heart medications are just not made for the baby because obviously there's not that many babies with you know these type of conditions", "FsJzCdFlpyQ": "Turns out it's kinda hard to come up with a good prop For a show about illegal psychoactive compounds that aren't gonna get you in some pretty significant trouble So, I got nothing But, today, we are talking about Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Otherwise known as the major biologically active substance in the cannabis plant Otherwise known as marijuana So, here it is! The molecule, not the marijuana No matter what you think of this compound, or how familiar you may be with it There is no denying that THC is pretty potent Its effect stems from its ability to bind to receptors in your brain called \"cannabanoid receptors\" And the reaction that takes place after that binding occurs Now, calling them cannabinoid receptors is kind of misleading, it makes it sound like they're designed to be stimulated by cannabis They're not They're receptors located on neurons and they're activated by chemicals called neurotransmitters Which basically allow neurons to communicate with each other Cannabinoid receptors are found in all different parts of the brain Their highest density occurs in the areas of the brain responsible for pleasure, thinking, memory, coordination,  time perception Normally, these cannabinoid receptors are not activated by cannabis, they're activated by a chemical called Anandamide And that neurotransmitter plays a large role in making short-term connections between nerve cells It's also largely responsible for the brain's ability to forget things Which is very useful in our normal, daily lives. We can't remember everything And it seems to have a hand in regulating our eating behavior As well as generating sensations of pleasure It's name, Anandamide, which is kind of a beautiful word, comes from the Sanskrit word, for inner bliss Anandamide, for what it's worth, has been found in chocolate Anandamide and THC belong to the same class of chemicals, which we call cannabinoids By mimicking Anadamide, binding to, and activating, those receptors, THC interferes with the normal functioning of your brain Well, your brain is now on drugs By attaching itself to a neuron, THC screws up communication between other neurons Let's say neuron one needs to tell neuron two to do something, like \"remember a phone number,\" Or \"hit a baseball with the baseball bat\" Well, if THC is bound to one of those neurons, that communication is more likely to fail And the person is less likely to remember that thing or hit that baseball So, roughly that's how THC affects the brain But, there are some other obvious, and interesting questions here, like: Why, on Earth, would a plant decide to make a chemical that does this? What. Wha- Why? To paraphrase the author Michael Paul, A plant does not go through the expense of making such a complicated and extraordinary molecule, and continuing to produce it, if it isn't doing that plant some good It turns out no one knows for sure why marijuana produces THC, but there are some fascinating theories The first: THC turns out to be really good at absorbing UV radiation And so it's possible that, since marijuana often grows at higher elevations, That it needs the ability to absorb that radiation without, you know, harming the plant THC also has some antibiotic properties so it's possible that that's how it's helping out plants It also may help us out Scientists have done studies and found that THC is a fairly potent antibacterial And third, is my absolutely favorite reason, and that's that other animals have these cannabinoid receptors too And it's possible that leaf eating insects have them, And that THC is there to put them on drugs So that they, like, forget where they found that delicious plant And they're like, \"Oh, man. I had that really good plant yesterday, but I can't remember where I found it\" Then they just end up, like eating cheetos, outside of a 7-11 at 2 am Which, you know, if you're a beetle, it's not so bad I live in Missoula, Montana. It's a college town, fairly high pot smoking population here Also a very high deer population I'm starting to wonder: the deer are always walking around downtown, with this, like, glazed look over their eyes And I'm thinking maybe they're getting into somebody's stash And now they're all addled, can't find where they found that delicious brick of marijuana on someone's back porch They're just walking around downtown, hoping, hoping beyond hope, that they'll stumble across one again Animals on drugs! It's no laughing matter!

molecules\ncitrus plants make terpene molecules evergreen plants make trippy molecules\ndrippings are made by a lot of different molecules including cannabis they do\nhave medical effect even at very low concentrations and terpenes and\ncannabinoids actually share similar precursor molecules so that they're\nthey're made from the same basic ingredients and the plants biological\nsystems end up making different molecules\nit's the terpenes that are responsible for the smell of marijuana it's flavors\nbecause the cannabinoids THC and CBD don't have any smell to them so when we\nare smelling the terpenes whether it's a lemon cush or it's a very piney\nfragrance those are the terpenes and not the cannabinoids terpenes are common to\nhuman diets they are listed by the regulatory agencies as generally\nrecognized as safe' they behave very safely have a long history of use in\nhumans topically they're very safe fresh there can be some minor irritation if\nthe product is old terpenes can sometimes on rare occasions cause minor\nskin irritations and nothing ever harmful happens from them and they are\nwhat they do is they interact with different enzyme systems in the body\nneurotransmitters second messenger systems and these are part of the ways\nthat they create physiologic effects the cannabis plant can have a very wide\nvariety of terpene expressions even within the same plant itself terpene\nconcentration will vary throughout processing it can actually the terpene\nlevels can raise as the plant dries and also\nas the plant ages it loses as the dried flower age is it will lose some of its\nsmell those are the terpenes so that when you open a nice new jar of really\nsmelly flowers that can kind of permeate the room\nthose are the terpenes literally leaving the plant and going into the air they do\nhave medical benefit at very low concentrations in the plant because of\nthe way it uses them will will be fairly variable for example upper leaves upper\nleaves tend to be preyed upon by insects a lot of the time so the plant will put\nout anti insecticide terpenes such as limonene or piney versus in the lower\nplant might be more appropriate for it to put some of the bitter Cisco terpenes\nin ought to prevent grazing from forest woodland mammals animals things like\nthat so different terpene levels in the upper versus the lower and the terpene\nlevels can change throughout processing also when you are preparing or making\nyour own medicine with cannabis a lot of people bake with cannabis you'll notice\nthat the room starts to smell like marijuana after it's been baking for a\nwhile those are the terpenes in the air they've left the plant and are not\nuseful for medicine when they've done that so one tip when processing and\nmaking home medicine is to keep the baked goods covered which would be\nsomething you normally wouldn't do say for example when you're cooking brownies\nyou would normally have them lift it up but it might be appropriate to cover\nthem with foil for example to keep some of the terpenes in there terpenes are\nvery effective even at low concentrations inhalation method we have\nsome good human studies on an terpenes can be effective topically and orally as\nwell so they're very versatile and they complement the cannabinoids and create\nsynergy so we create synergistic effects depending on how we use them\nterpenes are generally volatile molecules which means they like to go\ninto the air because of that when when one is\nprocessing terpenes or even just storing your flower at home is very important to\nkeep them tightly sealed glass containers I think are best for this how\nbroad are the variabilities and terpenes and where do you find higher\nconcentrations they can be quite broad the different levels of concentrations\nand if you look at any kind of the laboratory analyzed fingerprints a lot\nof labs are doing terpene analysis you'll see a pretty wide range of\nvariables the human smell and the palate can be very effective at detecting\ncertain terpenes and certainly combinations of flavors in wine the wine\ntasting world for example Somali A's have training and\nwhen you go to the test set for the Somali A's you're literally smelling the\nwine and you should be able to tell not only what type of wine it is but what\nyear it was grown and what soil it was grown in you'll notice when you first\npurchase something at the store and you take it home and you open it and you\nsmell it it might have a very powerful or pungent aroma to it again the\nterpenes but two or three weeks later especially if that jar has been opened\nclosed open closed those levels can change so processing can change it are\nthe type of soil that is grown in can can change it conditions of humidity and\ntemperature during the time of growing can affect it so terpenes tend to do\nwell in soils with a little less nitrogen the French have a saying about\nwine to make great wine the grapes must suffer and I think that they're talking\nabout real hot days real cold nights and some of the plant molecules in the grape\nthe proanthocyanidins are much more expressed during stress some of the\nplant chemicals are more expressed during times of stress so terpenes are\nquite variable but use your nose and the nose can become very sophisticated\nand also we have beautiful laboratory analytics now some of the displays I've\nseen are quite nice in terms of gauging the various different levels terpene\nconcentrations can vary and this is one large reason why some people do much\nbetter with certain types of cannabis than others and again that's a very\nindividual specific choice so and then on the medical side there is a very\npeople have very different reactions to certain types of cannabis and a lot of\nthat is the terpene profile so understanding as a consumer either a\nrecreational consumer or a medical consumer what works for me what doesn't\nwork for me that takes a lot of time it also takes experimenting with a lot of\ndifferent products botanical medicine is a much more fuzzy kind of a slow\nmedicine and it does require a lot of time and it requires at least somebody\nhelping the patient who knows what they're doing who can make proper\nsuggestions the patient can do a lot on their own through diaries of dosages\nstrain selection etc but a lot of the time an expert can sometimes be very\nhelpful to make suggestions and the terpenes are a good example of this huge\nvariability not only even within similar chemo types of the plant but also within\nthe same plan itself and then the cannabis one week is going to be a\ndifferent type of cannabis two or three weeks later especially if it gets is dry\nand exposed to open air and a lot of the terpenes can escape terpene production\nis more genetically than and environmentally determined so strain is\nvery important and cloning can produce similar results\nbut there is an environmental component terpene production increases with wide\nexposure so think of wine being stressed in the heat of the Sun kind of a thing\nand decreases with soil fertility but it does increase terpene yields are higher\nwhen the plants are deprived of nitrogen so to maintain tight tolerances good\nmanufacturing practices like you would a pharmaceutical for example cannabis does\nrequire the the vegetative processing of the plants to really have tightly\ncontrolled temperature light and humidity the more sophisticated recreational grows are definitely doing\na lot of this home grows maybe not so much but realize that there are\nenvironmental factors that definitely do affect it and that also genetics are the\nsame so again protecting your phenotypes sharing that genetic information is an\nimportant part of the terpene whole terpene profile so when we look at\nstudies we know that rodents laboratory animals show there can be actually\npretty profound effects on their activity you can have the animals in a\nin a relatively lethargic state and you can introduce terpenes and you can\nobserve increases in movements and movement patterns while very obvious and\nthis can happen in very low concentrations so that definitely\nsuggest the pharmacologic effect on their nervous systems\nas low as low as five nanograms per ml and then we also see positive effects at\nundetectable levels in the blood which could be because the terpenes even\nthough they come in and already low concentrations they distribute pretty\nwidely in the body if it's in the nervous system they really go into the\nlipids pretty quickly so the body can absorb a lot of the terpene\nand take them right out of the plasma but we can still have effects at very\nlow concentrations some studies show strong serotonin\nactivity which could be partially responsible for the effects on mood pain\nand sleep and we see this a lot with some of the quotes indica strains and\njust a caveat we know that we're gonna be changing that nomenclature soon but\ncertainly some types of cannabis will make people much more sleepy than other\ntypes of cannabis a lot of this is involved with the terpene profiles I\nthink that when we have an educated palate we can learn to smell the types\nof cannabis that tend to work best for us some people will notice that they do\nmuch better with certain types of strains than others and again back to\nthe genetic component a large part of terpene production is genetic so\nutilizing genetic information can potentially be helpful for folks as well\nthe terpenes will start with mere scene Mersin also known as beta mere seen is a\nterpene that is common to a lot of other plants lemongrass has high levels of Mir\nseen in it as do mangos and hops hops and and lemongrass are known to have\nsedative and relaxing effects and hops is actually a cousin of cannabis in the\nplant world so when combined with THC especially\nthere's a synergistic effect with Mir scene and it really can help produce\nsedation Mir scene is one of the molecules responsible for couch lock so\nfor those people who really like in indica to really get into their body and\nfeel relaxed that a lot of the times is a high mersin component it does have\nsome pretty remarkable physiologic effects as a standalone molecule it's\nanti-inflammatory through prostaglandin pathways so anytime you're using an\nanti-inflammatory approach there are different in\nNitori pathways and when you hit more than one you have this potential for\nsynergy as well so l so in addition to an anti-inflammatory is a good pain\nreliever I mentioned the sedative aspects of it\nit is a muscle relaxant and in animal studies mersin blocks liver cancer from\nforming this is I think really interesting and we will attach a pretty\ntechnical link to a pretty technical article on terpenes and liver cancer I'm\nnot suggesting that that's the case but just in terms of liver protection\nthinking of medicines we normally think of medicines as things that hit the\nliver hard acetaminophen tylenol for example can literally cause liver cancer\nthis is a pain relieving molecule that actually in animal studies is preventing\nit so and again potential for synergy with other pathways whether that be for\nsleep induction or for pain relief or for muscle relaxation for spasticity\nthis is a pretty good molecule and is shared by a bunch of other plants on\nthat line sometimes it could theoretically be much cheaper to get\nterpenes from say lemon grass or mangos than it would be to hunt for a cannabis\nplant and try to create one that's super high in a certain level sometimes I\nrecommend that my patients would enjoy like a mango smoothie or a mango drink\nwith the cannabis or a lemongrass tea along with the cannabis there are ways\nthat we can utilize these chemicals very affordably from other plants because\ncannabis is still a pretty expensive plant if you think about it D limonene also limonene is what it's\ncalled this is has a very lemony smell to it so even something like a\nfresh pledge something that kind of smells clean and bright we know in human\nstudies that we can take the pressed patients we can put them in a room we\ncan expose them to the limonene at very low levels and measure their depression\non something called a Hamilton depression score and you can literally\nsee the before and after their scores the scores on the depressions are\nreduced they also reduce their use over time of antidepressant medications we\nsee we see a lot of folks changing their medications with cannabis I recommend\nany antidepressant drug to be done under the supervision and care of a physician\nbut what the science is showing is that this terpene is actually having an\neffect limonene is a very potent antidepressant through inhalation what I\nlike to use the lemon fragrances for or if people are having a bad reaction to\nTHC a lot of the times the lemon can kind of lift them out of that dour mood\nI don't know if you've ever had an experience of trying a particular strain\nand then all of a sudden you're in a bad mood or you're worried about something\nthat may or may not be this but if you see that same pattern happening over and\nover again with the same strain that could be indicative one thing that can\nbe very helpful are some of the lemon flavors with that limonene does affect\nserotonin pathways so there is a mechanism that physiologically makes\nsense why we would be having these anti-anxiety properties it can help with\nGERD topically can be helpful against acne bacteria and in laboratory and cell\ntissue studies actually causes breast cancer lines to self-destruct so it\nliterally turns on an auto destruction program in breast cancer cells again not\nin humans we need we need more study on and I find it to be very synergistic\nwith THC for folks who tend not to like THC but may need a little bit of THC\nbecause that helps with their pain is a good terpene to have for daytime use\npining pining is one of my favorites not because of what it does but because I\ncan just smell it so easily so a lot of the times I don't even need a lab to\nknow that it's there it is anti-inflammatory through prostaglandin\npathways it also acts as a bronchodilator which means it opens the\nairways which can be good for asthmatics especially good for folks who have may\nhave trouble with inhalation up I mean oriented product where they want to do\nan inhalation might make that a little bit better pining does aid in memory\nthat's one of the places where I think it can be most useful people who tend to\nget a little dumb or stupid when they're using too much THC the pining can kind\nof help neutralize that as along with the CBD and it does aid the memory as an\nacetylcholinesterase inhibitor so we know the mechanism about that so when I\nthink a pine when I smell pine I'm thinking oh that's good that the THC\nhigh is going to be more tempered less of a stupid patient less likely to take\nthe IQ down baby carry off lean beta carry off lean the evolutionary function\nof this terpene if the plant uses it to stop itself from being eaten either by\ninsects or even mammals herbivores and at the same time there is a predatory\nlace wig insect that when it smells beta carry off Elaine it's attracted to the\nplant so it's actually repelling the insects that it doesn't like and it is\nattracting the insects that eat the insects that\nlike kind of like a ladybug will take care of insects in a beneficial way very\ncommon to black pepper beta carry awfully niz a terpene that is common to\nblack pepper and also copaiba balsam it has a good anti-inflammatory activity at\nlow level and can be good in a topical product Linh Elul is chirping that is\ncommon in lavender and many people are familiar with lavender it's become very\npopular lavender pillows very nice relaxing smell for a lot of folks it's\nbelieved that Linda lue mod modulates glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters so\nlargely responsible for some of the anti-anxiety effects of it and also it\nis a sedative on inhalation and in a rodent model so we talked about earlier\non limonene in a rodent model getting the animals to move faster the lin Ahlul\nwill slow them down and it is an analgesic via adenosine receptors so is\nworking on a different pathway from the prostaglandins that a lot of the other\nterpenes run on I think of this as a sedative something that along with mere\nscene can really help with a couch lock and again the terpenes can be present in\nthe cannabis plant or they can come from another plant such as lavender we don't\nnecessarily need to have them together I don't recommend this but some folks will\nactually pepper not pepper in but some folks will actually sprinkle in some a\nlittle bit of lavender flower and with their smoke to add a little bit of a\nflavor I don't I don't know very much about the smoking of lavender but from a\nterpene perspective that certainly make sense on one level but again a\nregular lavender diffuser in the atmosphere or even a lavender candle or\nsomething like that can have a positive influence in the room for patients or\nrecreational users who are using cannabis again this is something that\ntends to be calming and sleep inducing so think couch lock think a sleep aid\nthat kind of thing I do think we have a shortage of experts in the field and and\nand this specialized knowledge is important too because it's not about\nwhether or not cannabis works a lot of the times it's how to get it to work\nbetter or best and when we have a shortage of experts the market doesn't\nbehave like it should because the consumers are not experiencing the\npositive effects that they could be experiencing if they are getting good\neducation and good advice and again this being a plant it's a very fuzzy thing as\nyou can see from all the information in our videos here little things make a\ndifference so what is important is quality of products good selection of\nproducts folks who can make good recommendations for those products and\nthen consumers who are educated enough to make intelligent choices to choose a\nproduct a B or C and to try them out and see which one may work best for them so\nI do think that the whole industry suffers with a lack of expertise and I\nhope that part of what we're doing here is to kind of raise the overall level of\nawareness so that people can make good choices out there for this botanical so\nagain with botanical medicine there are so many things to consider and it is not\nso much having an ideal perfect product but having the patient be aware and be\nable to make choices and adjustments so again knowledge is a very critical thing\nand that's one of the things we're here doing it medical\nmarijuana for one one you", "YzvlJW22QeM": "hi guys welcome back to vvv and today

that hey get back to work calming", "IDr0yI-tYts": "What's up class. The topic of today's\ndiscussion is; do terpenes have medical benefits? It is an excellent question,\nit's one we get asked all the time. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and I'm here today to tell you the truth about whether terpenes actually\nhave medical benefits or not, in today's episode: \"Do Terpenes Have\nMedical Benefits\" from The Terpene Institute. So as a terpene manufacturer\nthis is one question that I get asked all the time; is whether terpenes have\nmedical benefits, and what terpenes should I use from my medical benefit. So here's\nthe thing, the FDA was specifically designed so that people don't just go\nout there and make products that claim to have medical benefits. There's good\nreason for this. Now we all understand that cannabis is in this weird situation\nwhere, we know that it has- it helps people, but the FDA isn't allowing it. But\nthe problem is is that people were going out there and preying on sick people. Sick people, they really get desperate. For good reason, they're dying, or they're\nvery ill. And then you get some fraudster that comes along and they're like, \"well I\ncan cure your cancer, just give me all your money on this expensive ass product\". Because those people are under terrible situation, they get preyed upon.\nThe FDA, in part, was created to make sure- to protect people from situations like\nthat. There's a lot of situations like that in the cannabis industry. So what's\nreally important is that we protect the medical patients, because they truly are\nthe backbone of this cannabis industry. They got us here, they put in the hard\nwork, and we need to protect them, so that they understand what does and does\nnot work. So, the question here again is whether terpenes have medical benefits. Now I'm a terpene manufacturer. I make terpene profiles, they are in millions\nof products across the country. I'm pretty well qualified to answer this\nquestion. So here's the answer: terpenes have been researched by other\nscientists. And those scientists have said that individual terpenes do have\nmedical benefits, such as anti-nausea, anti-inflammatory, a whole range of\ndifferent things depending on the terpene. Now, again with the FDA, the FDA says that we cannot create products that are intended to cure, diagnose diseases. So as a manufacturer it is not my place to tell you that this bottle can be an\nanti-inflammatory. Because I'm not qualified to make that decision. What I\ncan tell you is that other scientists have looked at the ingredients that I\nuse in this bottle, they have said that those specific ingredients do have\nmedical benefits. Now customers always come to me and they say, \"Drew can I use\nthis as an anti-inflammatory?\" What I always recommend you should do for any\ntime that anybody asks you the medical benefits of anything in cannabis, is the\nsame response that I give people. It is up to your doctor to take a look at your\ncondition and tell you what would work best for your condition. If your doctor\nsays alpha-pinene would help your condition; you can call me and I will\ntell you which products contain alpha pining. You would then need to consult\nwith your doctor as to how much of that to use to treat your condition. I simply\nprovide a product. I can make no claims about whether it has a medical benefit,\nor if it will or won't help you. That is up to your doctor, a trained professional,\nwho understands your health. Anybody who is doing anything but that, is mainly\ndoing something illegal, and probably doing something fraudulent. The problem\nwith that is, I understand you were trying to help another human being. I can-\nI get it on a compassion level, I've grown for I don't know, 70 to 100 medical\npatients over 20 years, I grew for a lot of medical patients. I gave it all away\nfor free and never charged anybody, okay? I understand that. The problem is, is when\nyou take something like this, and you're talking to a medical patient, if you are\nnot a doctor, you do not understand what underlying problems this person may\nhave. You do not understand what medications they may be taking. You don't understand if there may be interactions between some of these terpenes, and some of the medications. Does this person have problems they are not telling you? Do they have compromised immune systems? You are not a doctor. Not a trained\nprofessional. You're probably just operating in the cannabis industry like\nthe rest of us. You may be trying to help somebody, with all your heart, with best\nintentions, and end up harming them or potentially killing them by recommending that they eat some terpenes, or use this terpene on their skin and it absorbs\nwith their bloodstream, and messes up because they got a liver issue. Those are\nnot decisions for you to make. If anybody asks you, or if anybody asked me, again\nthe response should be; you need to talk to your doctor or a trained medical\nprofessional. Ask them if my products have a benefit to you. If they do I will\nprovide you your products. You need to discuss with your doctor: how much to use, when to use them, and so on. Anything other than that is exactly what the FDA\nwas created to stop. Preying on people, telling them you have the cure, telling\nthem what they should use. Don't play doctor. These are people's lives,\nyour money's not that important. Find another way to make a dollar, okay? So, on that topic we need to discuss another couple things in the industry that\npeople shouldn't be doing as far as FDA regulated stuff. But that's a whole\nother video. Watch my video on CBD's, that one's gonna be crazy controversial. But\nit's a really important topic that we need to discuss. The Terpene Institute\nhere was designed just to give people a common sense approach to terpenes, and their use in this industry. I tell everyone: I don't have a college degree.\nHigh School was barely there for me. But what I do have is a very successful\nbusiness putting products in the hands of millions of people that are also\nmaking tons of money. You're probably smarter than I am, you probably have a\nbetter degree for it than I do, and if you want to get into this\nbusiness I will teach you how to make money. You can go to college but your\ncollege professor probably drives a Volvo and hasn't paid his house off. I'm\nin a little bit different situation, so you can choose who you want to learn\nfrom. Make sure that you go and watch our other videos, and learn something, learn a\nbit about the industry. If you want to try my products, go to MrExtractor.com.\nI make cannabis terpene profiles. I take individual terpenes from plants and\nblend them together, and I make affordable, excellent cannabis terpene\nprofiles that you can use to make vapor pens, flavor your dabs, dip and dab,\nanything you want to use it for. I'll walk you through it at a good price. Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video.", "JxVuBHMKSuU": "hi I'm Scott with Flex your rights we talked last time about some of the ways that a police encounter can get out of hand and even go horribly wrong and a couple of people asked the same question response to that video which is what do you do if police say they smell marijuana and this is actually a really tough question and for reasons that we'll get into it's it's something that you might want to learn more about even if you don't actually use marijuana the truth is that you don't have a lot of options in this situation but let me break it down for you and I'll just try to be as helpful as I can the reason this is such a big issue is that the smell of marijuana by itself is considered probable cause to believe there's a crime going on so as long as people lease smell it or claim that they smell it in most situations they can automatically search you and unfortunately the courts trust police officers to be honest about this which creates all sorts of problems and and that's why it's something that can affect you whether or not you're a marijuana user the smell of marijuana is something that the officer might bring up as an issue to sort of manufacture probable cause after you've refused to search and so that's why it's a big deal and so let's talk about about some of the ways that you can protect yourself from having this happen to you first and foremost we want to eliminate the possibility that you're actually running around reeking of marijuana believe it or not a lot of police officers aren't liars and they aren't going to just say that they smell pot if they don't so most of the time when an officer claims that they smell marijuana it's because they actually smell it and that's the reason that they think there's something going on that's why they want to search so so first of all we have to eliminate that factor and that's going to reduce your odds of getting jammed up considerably above all this means that you aren't ever smoking marijuana in your car smoking in the car is just the best and most efficient way in the world to get arrested for marijuana we get emails at Flex rates every day from people who got in trouble and nine times out of ten it had something to do with smoking in or around the vehicle that's just the number one way that it happens in my ex and and there's no there's no reason for it it just doesn't make sense I mean if you're so impatient that you can't you know drive for 30 minutes without sparking something well then you're gonna hate being subjected to a weekly your analysis when you're on probation after getting busted inevitably so cool it with that for your own good please and beyond that if there's anything in your car that might smell like marijuana for example a bag of it or an apparatus or what have you you know keep that stuff stored away and sealed up better yet keep it out of the car you know it really shouldn't be there unfortunately making sure your car doesn't smell like marijuana might not be enough it's really just the beginning if the officer becomes really suspicious of you they can lie or just imagine it even when it isn't there and for you that can be just as bad as the real thing because it means that that they now believe they have probable cause to go ahead and search the vehicle or at least that's what they're claiming another important thing is just to make sure that you keep your car clean in general because when police see a dirty car they think of drugs so if your car is clean the officer is just a lot less likely to even start with you again this is a preventative measure but you know it's it's important it really does make a difference along these same lines remember that police profile like crazy so if you're running around looking super cool all the time they're gonna notice you I you know I would never recommend that you tone down your style you know it's a free country and you shouldn't be afraid to be yourself and be awesome but also just be aware that if you have a distinctive look or a flashy vehicle it just means you're more likely to get harassed you know it's [ __ ] but but be ready for it I get emails all the time from biker dudes and people like that you don't even do drugs but are getting pulled over and harassed and searched by police all the time for dope it's just a dumb stereotype but but it's also the reality of how our laws are enforced particularly under the war on drugs think about what what you have with you for example if if you do fit a profile or if you have a history of getting harassed by police you factor that into your decision making about whether to make yourself vulnerable to a criminal arrest now the last thing and this is perhaps the most point of all is that you always want to assert your rights no matter what keep in mind that that when police say for example that they smell marijuana it might just be a trick they might just be trying to judge your reaction or scare you and they're looking for sort of these verbal or nonverbal you know cues from you your eyes darting around or your breathing heating up and these kinds of things that police officers deliberately try to provoke you to create those reactions when they're suspicious they may not be their intention to do a full search of the vehicle unless you give off some sign of guilt and so things like making references to marijuana you look stone you smell like pot these things could just be a trick and so you don't want to panic at that point and waive your rights you always want to refuse the search if they're asking to search the vehicle you always want to say no and if they're claiming to smell marijuana you want to respond the way that an innocent person would would respond and hopefully you are innocent because you haven't been smoking pot in your car so you say you know officer I don't smell anything or you know officer whatever you're smelling it didn't come from in here you know it may or may not stop them but it but it gives you a better chance of getting out of the encounter and most importantly if you do flex your rights and ultimately you're searched illegally if you're arrested as a result of illegally obtained evidence all of these things can be challenged in a court of law now probable cause derived by something like marijuana odor is hard to disprove in court it's very hard but an officer who for example would make a claim like that dishonestly may very well have a track record of making the same claim every time they pull somebody over and the search is refused and so you got to keep in mind that there's a track record here in a good attorney can get in there in a court of law and maybe even win your case so don't give up that's the important thing is to sort of be prepared for all these possible outcomes and this is a particularly tricky situation and one that sort of lends itself to a little bit of corruption and dishonesty on the part of police officers but if you're ready for it and if you make the right choices if you keep your car clean if you assert your rights even this situation is something that you can have a chance of driving away from safely and finally please do check out our website at flexor rights org we have a detailed

real did you know that Palmetto State is the official name of South Carolina I didn't well this company had a big impact on the entire CBD industry let's get to it let's just see if it's real first see that authenticity Ward gives it away a little bit they claim 600 milligrams of cannabinoids and our lab found 560 milligrams of camera noise or only 6.8 percent less that's extremely accurate for the CBD industry now here's the breakdown 492 milligrams of CBD THC high levels of both CB c and c BG pay attention to those the CB G and CBC this was named after a girl named harmony who lived in the Palmetto State thus Palmetto harmony the story goes that she reduced her seizures by 90% and reduced her pharmaceutical intake by 80% this story is very similar to the case study of Charlotte's Web another brand in strain of hemp that has high levels of C B G and C BC they need to walk in a fine line here because the FDA doesn't even let them talk about this even if there's research behind it because it needs FDA approved research you look up the research don't listen to me I'm just a dumb CBD reviewer a visual lab test is here it's just one tests I don't claim they'll all test this way the cost cost is high as well 16 cents per milligram 15 cents is average but at 80 bucks it's a little high if cost is a concern even Charlotte's Web is a little cheaper a great company alternative companies Bluebird botanicals which is even cheaper and has these similar cannabinoids and then there's Lazarus Naturals which is super cheap has these cannabinoids for a fraction of the price but I've only tested one of their products and they don't have the same reputation as all these other companies this is just hemp and MCT oil you can dive into the milliliter breakdown here again links below to all of this now this company did get my CBD examine authenticity award because they've been around they have zero negative reports that I could find USDA Organic the story's real there's research the founder is a badass woman of hemp I didn't make that up she are in that tie as a pioneer pushing for the legalization of CBD in South Carolina so that kids literally dying of epilepsy can have access to a natural substance that steamed non-addictive and safe by the World Health Organization yeah she gets extra points for that I can't believe that hemp was even illegal for the better part of a century not anymore because of badass women like Janel Ralph and that's my review subscribe and I will see you next time", "P2qeSKorcBE": "[Music] now we're heading southbound now we're in
