{"F76VX9CWFEE": "Schaffer I've been thinking about ways to try to help your skiing and I thought after visiting you last Christmas which was awesome by the way steam goes fantastic thank you for that that maybe we could address some service work I got to know your waxing setup in your garage pretty well it's sweet really nicely done I didn't watch you wax very much because when you first came into work on skis I saw you approach the ski with fear in your eyes and then when I saw you work on the skis I realize you should have had a lot more fear in your eyes and I want to try to start to eliminate some of the cause for that fear and so I have come up with a system for you a special system for special guys like yourself to try to make this easier first of all excuse need wax they gotta have paraffin ironed on to him once in a while and what you're going to have to scrape skis and when you do you need the right tools group scraper first of all you should always scrape your grooves first my groove scraper is this beauty you can't have it my brother made it for me it weighs about 6 pounds with a brass handle and a stainless steel rod I hate this but it works it's a cheap piece of plastic that has just the right shapes and contours to get into a groove even a Rossignol groove so you need to you need to get one of these I'm gonna send you one of these maybe I already did it I sent you one of these Red Creek groove scraper super cheap next thing are normal scrapers all professionals prefer three millimeter scraper with the reason is this skis don't stay flat they never stay flat and so you have to sort of be able to bend and flex the scraper a little bit and help get the wax out however we have some special edition 5 millimeter red creek scrapers for special people like you because if you're perched up here over the ski and and you're a little bit terrified stiffer scrapers a little more stable I'm gonna demonstrate really quickly I am gonna use my tool [Music] special five-millimeter scraper for special people protip John if you're doing the edge of the ski use the end of the scraper so you don't dull the scraping surface come son like this right here if you see 45 degrees there you go do it like that so I don't have to get angry at you when you're scraping the ski get your thumbs right over the work put them down low on the scraper like this and then they sit right on either side of the groove and your fingers can be little guys just like this there you go that'll make it less terrifying don't go like this don't like perch your hands up high don't you just just get behind it and push that's good this thing is for when your scraper gets dull and it will get dull it'll take a lot of Wax right off the surface you're gonna need this brush we call it the monster brush it's really good for getting wax off the surface between the five millimeter scraper a good sharp groove scraper and this you should be okay you really should be able to scrape paraffin after the monster brush you just want to use your standard brushes if you're not a total cheapskate you might have some roto brushes like me now look this is when we pick up and get exciting I have here some liquid paraffins almost every company is making liquid paraffins now they're not all the same I haven't tested all of them I have been working with the star ones for a while and I happen to know that lakhs contributed to some very fast skis in some of the early World Cups these are really really high quality HF paraffins so we're looking for both convenience and performance here because there's so much wax material in this product you can actually iron it after spreading it on the ski with a relatively low temp iron about 125 and you will get some saturation of the material into the skis and they tend to perform better that way as well so I'm just going to demonstrate it's a solving based product which means that shipping is a bit of a pain you got a ground ship but you just spread it on my finger paint it if you're concerned about the chemicals just use a little fiber lean doesn't take a lot it covers pretty easily the cost is relatively low and if you don't want to use heat you can just let it dry but I'm going to show you an ironed application quick pass with the iron down the ski will put the wax into solution not deeply into solution but plenty well enough to ensure really good durability and really good performance at that point you're pretty much done there's not much heat in the base it cools really really rapidly and if you just let it dry that's fine too I'd recommend giving it a few minutes you can skip scraping altogether that nice five millimeter scraper that I got you you don't need it I really like this brass brush it's inexpensive it's really fine it's really mild on the base it just cleans the structure really well and takes the the excess material off one bottle of wax one brush quick iron hit if you've got the patience in time for it and you want a little better performance and durability otherwise you're good to go we've got a cold a medium and a warm and they're really high level performing products we're using them at all levels of racing and finding some added benefit to them over regular paraffin I want to reiterate though skis need paraffin skis need to be fed with paraffin the bases need paraffin in solution and this isn't really gonna take care of it you get good performance out of the surface but you got to get your skis waxed every couple of weeks so my recommendation is to check with one of the local you know local people who know what they're doing like check with smullin know check that go for tape get Brian Kate over he's a nicer guy anyway I should be good to go this stuff will keep you keep you going fast dish you know relatively speaking", "8bnaBpCCoNM": "YouTube what up what up we are trying this wax liquidizer I'm gonna try to make some cartridges today this is where I all started on it right here wax liquid visors all made me start doing YouTube and everything else we have mandarin cookies wax it was pressed around here at 16 so the majority of people that are using this stuff is using wax like this anyways not dispensary wax so I want to try to make it is wrong as we can so I'm through this I got the oven at 200 right now it's preheating once the preheats we're going to throw it in there let it bake for 20 minutes and I said gonna deke Arbit to get all the extra plant matter out of it and all that and it's in the oven preheated 200 degrees on fire in the oven in our D carbon process harder whoa got that shot get out of here 20 minutes down believe is closed I'll pop in and out and show you guys [Music] I'm gonna put ERPs in this cuz I believe by putting in the oven I think that makes the turf [Music] I'm gonna throw this and see the water looks like let's take a look at some of this pull her out that is d\u00e9cor THCA I believe all right it's out the oven [ __ ] are real anxious here wanting to try this out well it's already done it's done bubbled up I'm throwing this we got it I mean a little bit 0.5 mix this all up like throw it in

different needle because if you suck up and there's still some of that left some of your tarp left in there that didn't mix right it's gonna leave that weird filmy residue in your cart it's gonna look like [ __ ] right off the rim so that's a big no-no it's starting to I mean it's not looking [ __ ] I'm not even interviews how thick those thicken around I didn't put those thickened earnings at all

for ukulele where we're going to be learning the easiest chords that you can play on ukulele and get started with some real songs right from day one I've got my recommended first song that you should learn on ukulele coming in just a couple of minutes and at the end of this video I'll show you my top five with cochise link to in the description that you should start to learn as soon as you've got a little bit of experience and you've learned these three easy chords but first of all let's talk a little bit about the ukulele itself this is a concert ukulele and most ukuleles that you probably have if you do have one with you now and likely a soprano concert or tenor ukulele which are all absolutely fine for this course it is just a baritone ukulele which is quite noticeably bigger and we have different tuning notes for that one but the tuner notes for your ukulele here are g c e and a and we can check those and I recommend that you do check them by getting yourself a tuner that can just clip onto the edge of your ukulele here and this particular ukulele is an act lot ukulele which I'll link to in the description it comes with a gig bag it comes with a tuner selection of picks and even a little sort of starter guide which is really cool to have all your chords laid out a few easy songs how to record diagrams a lot the stuff we'll be looking at in this video but you know there's there's a great little free booklet in that one and it's a good affordable option if you already have a ukulele do not upgrade until you realize there's a reason that you need to upgrade for example you know yours is going out of tune all the time or it's particularly hard to play or you don't like the sound of it or look of it those things are good reasons to get yourself a new ukulele if this is something that you wanted to do and you're wanting a nice portable instrument that's really easy to play and it can have loads of fun playing some new songs with now other than a tuner there are no other accessories you need at all to be able to play ukulele you can grab it and get started right away you have the option of getting a strap if you find it easier to hold in your strap would clip onto here and here the tube pegs and then you can put it around your neck and that will support it and can make it easier however the easiest way to do it is to support the ukulele neck with the side of the palm of your hand and then just rest in your thumb almost on top but just around the back like this and then supporting the body of the ukulele with the inside of the forearm here if you're sitting or standing or if you prefer just rest it on your lap and keep it a little bit lower like this and it can be more secure in that fashion if that's what you prefer the first chord that we're going to be learning is a C major chord and it just takes one finger to be able to play I would prefer if we could use the third finger and this would be at the third fret and holding the ukulele in the fashion that I described before that would sound like this when we hold the ukulele in this fashion we want to really curl over our fingers like I never claw hand like this that just means that when we're playing any other cause that we go for we're not muting any strings and just getting this sort of dead sound keep your fingers right on the tips and curled over and don't touch any other strings at all and then it should sound really good and wring out exactly how we want the chord diagram that's on the screen now is written this way round so the top of the chord diagram is actually the end of the ukulele here every line is a fret going horizontally every line vertically is a strength and that is what this particular chord would look like the C major chord the second chord we're going to be going for is the F major chord now any guitarists among you must be thinking oh my word the second chord we're going for is an F that's really difficult well on ukulele it isn't it only actually uses two fingers and the fingers that we will need a fingers one and two on the first fret of the second string and the middle finger on the second fret of the fourth string so counting at one two three four the one nearest to you and there is our much easier F chord than it is on guitar we're hey this is good thing now it's with the F chord that you may wish to experiment a little with having the thumb a little bit higher or a little bit lower so we have these two ways which we can support the ukulele with this hand this is tends to be more secure with the outside of the palm of the hand and the thumb just here so some of you may prefer to have that thumb lower and particularly children may prefer and may get better results and a cleaner sound and a better sound bringing out takes a quite a bit of pressure when you're not used to it but ukulele strings are much more fingertip friendly for anyone children and adults alike so this is a great gateway into learning stringed instruments and perhaps one day again yourself a string six string guitar and being able to rock out but we're gonna rock out in the ukulele at the moment we want to strum all the strings on the ukulele unless there is a little cross over a certain string in which case you wouldn't strum that one but if very rarely happens most of the time we're going to be strumming all four strings just with our first finger and kind of using the nail a little bit so let's just change between those two chords now for around ten or fifteen seconds just to get some experience of doing it before we look at our first song so the C chord third finger third fret and then the F chord chord number two F major the C major chord number one the F major chord number two and the more practice we have the more repetition the easier it is going to get and the faster you will get playing real songs [Music] in fact that is how we can play most of the song that we're going to be going for today right now and this is you are my sunshine I'm sure everyone watching this video knows how the lyrics go to this one let me give you a quick demo and then I'll show you how to do it yourself just strumming every time that a chord is written and the chord sheet is linked to in the description below we want to play you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey you'll never know dear how much I love you and it's just the final line please don't take my sunshine away though we need a third chord fall so there's so much of this song we can play with two chords let's do it right away let's not delay at all so ready with that C chord changes are nice and slow and just strumming every time a chord is written starting with the C chord on sunshine ready play along with me you are my sunshine my only sunshine here's where we need to change to that F chord the second chord that we did do that for me now and ready on the word happy we strum again you make me happy we need to get straight back to C now so that first chord with the third finger here and it's on great when skies are gray it's the same as that again so back to the F you'll never know dear back to see how much I love you so hopefully now you see how important is to get those changes down you need to be comfortable changing no super quick but quick enough to be able to do it at that sort of speed so I invite you one more time you can skip along if you've got it but just change between the C and F and try and figure out can you hold the ukulele like this or are you going to go for this method which is perhaps a little bit more advanced and I'd encourage you to try it if you haven't yet we're we're using the thumb at the back of the neck and just the tips of the fingers to support the ukulele or you have this the third and final chord we're going to go for here is the G major chord but we actually make the shape with our fingers of a D major chord if you're familiar with that on the on the guitar and that is played if you're not familiar with it with the first finger at the third string second fret middle finger second fret on the lowest string on the bottom string and third finger third fret making a little triangle now it's this chord that is really handy to get used to the method of gripping the guitar between the side of your palm and the thumb because that puts your fingers on this angle which can be really handy and just really helps us support going between the three chords that we have the C the G and the F G major chord uses the shape of a D and although we're using three fingers should be okay for most people and the final line of our song is please don't take my sunshine away that was please don't take that's the C chord geez shaped like a D my sunshine away so if we're comfortable with those changes we can have a go at this song now and then add some strumming to it if you're not you just need to drill those changes a little bit more till they are there but I'm sure most of you will be able to change at least between those first two chords to do the bulk of this song and really get get going with you ukulele straight away so from the top we're gonna start with the C chord and just stay there for two strums ready play along with me on sunshine strum on sunshine you are my sunshine my only sunshine to the F the second chord which was this you'll make me happy back to a C when skies are gray f you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't take the g-major chord my sunshine end on C away one last time let's go for broke let's do it guys ready from the top you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't take my sunshine away now I'm gonna be suggesting another five great songs that are super easy and use these same three chords and just in a second but the last thing that I want us to do with this song is just try strumming on what we call the beat so when we play you are my sunshine my only sunshine we're playing on what's called the first beat of the bar and a bar is where some adults choose to have a drink but also it is a count of four beats okay so four beats to a bar to a regular pulse of one two three four okay and where we're currently strumming you are my son three four one two three four well we want to try and do if we can is strum and every one of those beats and just change chord on the word where you already know where to change to because you've had a few goes it so just as an example and just to go for broke with you guys because because I've got confidence in you is to start with our C chord and strum on every pulse on every beat you Wow my sunshine my only son you make me happy when skies are gray okay sounds really good right but does make it harder for those chord changes and it makes it harder if you strumming and singing at the same time so let's try and take it back to just what's happening on the ukulele for now we're gonna start with the C chord and we're going to strum it two rounds of four we always count to four in music there's a running joke that musicians can only count to four and somewhat that's true especially for me but we can start off with that C chord and we need to count for twice but stay on the C chord for example one two three four one two three four okay it's after that last one though we need to lift off as soon as you've strummed and changed to that F chord strumming four four and back to C for form okay let me shout it out now you've got the gist of it and we'll have a go at playing this together I will shout out those changes as we do them ready on the C chord in 1 2 3 4 C 2 3 stay on the C chord 3 4 F 2 3 and back to C F again and C and here we just have two strums of a C G G and C you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't do just took my sunshine away [Music] and I is a really simple way of playing you are my sunshine we're gonna learn some cooler strumming in tomorrow's lesson and but that's a great way to get started and I wouldn't do the strumming more complex than that if you use to more complex than that get on to the other days we're gonna learn some really cool stuff the other five songs that I would recommend at this kind of level if the score cheese that I link to below just use those chords C F and G but many of the songs will work with just these three chords in fact it's kind of hundreds really and you can follow chord sheets off the first one is happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to you we also have Amazing Grace again link to in the description the cauchy and I'm looking forward to filming some tutorials for these soon this is Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me so on and so forth there's lean on me by bill withers as well this is a simplified version just using these three chords lean on me when you're not strong and I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on [Music] it won't be long till I'm gone and somebody do they and finally something a little bit more rock and roll we've changed the key which we'll be talking about in later days in this 10-day course but this is how to play twist and shout by the Beatles played in this fashion CC f''fgf FG and just repeating that and singing along the rocky now we'll shake it up baby now shake it up baby twist and shout twist and shout come on baby [Music] lots of fun to be had there alright just a little bit to get started but if we start with real songs and those are great choices we can start to get more experience under your belt of how songs work and how you can go on to learn any song that you want even without a youtube video tutorial thank you so much for checking out this video please check out day 2 if you have enjoyed this 10 day static course so far and please subscribe to Mandy guitar youtube channel which is where you'll find more ukulele videos as soon as we have them uploaded I will link to some more on the screen now thank you so much for watching bye for now [Music]", "YnSIbI75mm0": "[Music] hi it's Matt at roughhouse studios and welcome to canna basics today we're going to be making ecig juice out of some very high-quality rosin pressed wax the first a quick word from today's episode sponsored a uniform smelling like bugs and skunk ain't no smell from you vaporizer when u blaze concentrates with wax liquidizer wax liquidizer deca [Music] in order to do this tutorial today you're gonna need some cartridges to fill up you're gonna need some rosin pressed wax it we'll get into that a little bit more in a second you're also going to need a shot glass to mix your a solution in you're gonna need some sort of solution such as wax liquidizer or you could use propylene glycol essential oils and vegetable glycerin the rosin pressed wax that were using we bought this rosin press wax from TLC its backs that's pressed from a machine using heat and pressure rather than using chemical solvents it's very clean and a very potent nice way to get cannabis in a compressed form this is cookies-and-cream live rosin so it was pressed from green plant material and we're also using some rosin that we had pressed this was pressed from some purple punch this was grown by jungle boys really high-quality medical grade cannabis this purple punch is a purple it's a very very smelling we had it pressed at the TLC dispensary where we bought it it was pressed one day ago for making this you can see it's a nice creamy sort of waxy buttery wax it's great it's awesome this is one of the best waxes done I really enjoyed the flavor and smell of it so we're gonna start out with it so we're gonna this is our fresh pressed rosin wax and this is the berry punch and we're putting it into the shot glass we've got about a gram of the wax that we're going to use for this tutorial so we're going ahead and scrape up all of that off of our parchment paper that we're going to use and put in the gram of wax into our container and you could use a regular shot glass we're using the shot glass that actually comes with the wax liquidizer kit okay now here's what you could use propylene glycol for this like I said we do recommend wax liquidiser because it has several different weights of propylene glycol already included and it's more cost efficient but you could also buy propylene glycol and use that as the majority you could also put a couple of drops of essential oils if you want the flavors if you decide for the wax liquidizer it already has propylene glycol and three different weights included in it so it's gonna help it keep from separating back out and it's like the optimal solution for doing this and it also has the essential oils already added into some of the flavors there's grape pineapple there's about six different flavors but we're gonna use the original flavor for this tutorial because it's devoid of any other flavoring and the reason we're doing this is because we're using really high-quality wax and one of them is an even live rose and press wax the terpenes and all that are already in that wax that were using is what we're going to preserve the flavor of so for this case we're gonna use unflavored you could use whichever flavor that you want so for this ratio we're using two milliliters of our propylene glycol or our solution here of the wax liquidiser per one gram of the wax okay so I measured out just a little bit shy of two milliliters here because I was just a little bit shy of a gram because we had to dab a couple of dabs of that rosin wax it was amazing so I put the propylene glycol or the wax liquidiser in this case on top of the solution just give it a little bit of a mix to incorporate it together and now for the fun part we're gonna put it in the microwave now goes in there for about ten seconds but I found that it took a little bit longer for the rosin than it did for the the BHO maximum that so I had to put it in two times but after two times the wax set was made from the fresh pressed rosin was ready to go it incorporated together nice honey golden color and the flavor and terpenes of that as we find out later is going to be excellent okay so now we're gonna go ahead and do the even higher quality wax that we have here this again was jungle boys grown cannabis that we're using this rosin puck here it's a half a gram so we're using one milliliter of the solution and you could use less of a ratio we could have used a half a milliliter and it would have been thicker and probably not as clear but what we end up in the end is great but I think you could go to like a 1:1 ratio on this or the other two we could have probably gotten by with one milliliter with the one gram of the purple pot rosin me here we go we're gonna put that in the microwave now the one thing I noticed with the rosin pressed puck here is that it took about twice as long even as the rosin press the previous one did that was kind of broken apart and scattered but instead of putting it for a long period of time instead of increasing the time to 30 seconds or whatever it's I would recommend putting it in for 10 seconds repeatedly so you don't let it get too hot and just prolonging the heat a little bit so that it has time to dissolve in there and that's what I did and after about the fourth time of putting it in there it came out almost perfectly clear and when in just a couple of minutes those couple of little dots and specks had dissolved and gone away and it was like I said almost perfectly clear just slightly amber amazing-looking e-cig juice a little thinner than it could be like I said on this one I think I could have gotten away with probably a half a milliliter and been fine and had a little thicker juice but in the end it really turned out great and as I said that was a little a couple of specks that were left in there after an hour so we're completely gone it it was completely clear by the time we got ready to put it into our tank and so that's the next and pretty much the final step other than smoking this is gonna be to put it into your prefilled tanks her into your unfilled cartridges that are refillable and this was one that I actually bought that was purchased empty because I didn't want anything to taint to the flavor but you could also refill you know like heavy headers or brass knuckles or whatever you those things are usually refillable [Music] okay so here we go our first try of this really really great cookies-and-cream live rosin and hit was amazing really amazing you could get the slightest little hint of the propylene glycol so I wish I'd use a little as ratio and the end on that one but it was amazing some of the best ecig juice I've ever had ever for cannabis this stuff is really great so I highly recommend if you can make it press your own rosin buy some rosin get some propylene glycol or some wax liquidiser and do it you will not regret it if you'd like to get wax liquidiser please check out wax liquidizer calm i would like to thank wifes liquidizer for sponsoring this video I hope you've enjoyed this video on how to make ecig juice from rosin if you

"clT0ZfwR5j4": "means ask for the 99% diamonds we got you a half gram and 99% diamonds they're hard as a rock not that wet tar penis they don't stick to you so we're gonna turn it into a cart so yeah let's get this started so you pretty much start out it's a clean empty like Pyrex container Wow what's up hey I'm doing a video what's up you coming over yeah on YouTube like I'm in the middle of the please please what's up you can you feel me coming over or do you don't all right you need you an extra empty Pyrex little glass container take that you're done baby there's a canary yellows I like the clear ones better I don't know while they're gonna have the tarp but these ain't bad these are like infused in the turf they're like not in saw so they still give you that little bit of flavor but they pack a super super duper punch knock down knock down blink all right that's our diamonds in there now let's add some of this wax liquidizer here pineapple express make sure you shake it up real nice this is still good that's been old it's a newer one pretty new might go with the Strawberry Cough what do you think public sponsor strawberry cause this one's been a banana orgy Strawberry Cough we're gonna do straight and it's hurt just strawberry cop it says to add ingredients add two milliliters of wax liquidizer to a microwavable safe cup saw glass along with one gram of your herbal concentrate microwaving mixture for 10 seconds well I'm not microwaving it and I'm only doing one milliliter of wax cuz the more you add the more runny it is and it just I don't know it ain't the same you can stretch it stretch it to be like you know you can get ten carts out of it or you can get like two decent ones so I'm gonna go with the 100 cuz I only got point 5 in here too so yeah we're gonna do one gram or 1 milliliter of this here again make sure you shake real well it's nice and clear stuff they say one of them tubes full equals one milliliter so there's your 1 million right there oh [ __ ] with the Diamonds oh man I'm really ATG I hope this comes out good all right that was 1 milliliter of wax liquidizer Strawberry Cough see it sorry it looks like it's starting we're gonna take us inside put it on the heat I don't do the microwave I throw it here and the stove I don't all melt down to the bottom somebody told me that who knows break down a little bit around whack shatter stuff like a crumble don't take this long usually tardive been mounted up this is just a harder denser that moonwalking again leave it on there for five more minutes all right this was looking like really clear really nice but really runny but it's hot they should thicken up I hope I'm gonna throw it in a needle a syringe and see what happens see outside all right it's only put it out those are them diamonds before it's too thick and I hope it does but I didn't flip that one soon so there is there this on there take that baby don't buy so far it's hard it's definitely still hard so you gotta give us some time to cool down you know first and the less bubbles you keep in your syringe the cleaner it comes out the bubbles make it all fuzzy they won't come on after the cartridge sits for a little bit but it happens we got a G got a G buying around [ __ ] look unclear [Music] super clear throw it in the cart you know Wow is that clear as clear could be damn that is dope queer [ __ ] this clears out it looks super good super clear everything mixed right the molecules are all in all fuzzy-wuzzy we try to get these last couple drops oh you're supposed to let these sit for 24 hours and I really am on patient it does move out a little bit more than I want to kind of pissed me off like I said it's still hot we'll see what happens but let's throw on a cart homemade cartridge from like wax liquidiser Suns right miles I'm sorry it's running I don't know why they tell you to put two point two milligrams whatever but let's try and smooth to throw like a lot of that other cut bullcrap pretty good I fell it it's good tastes good as long as this [ __ ] don't burn up in like seven hits the last video I made months ago is my phone it must have been crappy wax i noticed if you use better ID potency wax that you get a better outcome when we need more diamonds not I don't know 99 percent but they were anywhere from 96 to 99 and this stuff here so get in the stuff that's killing everybody out there is a thickener agency that's not everybody's putting in their cartridges not everybody but like the street lower than the street people China maybe who knows their felonies courts with that thickener just to make them look like they're thick and so you think they're good well that's not the case no more they got this new liquid it looks like distal and literally cleared this one you can flip it over it runs real slow you add that in the card and that's what has that vitamin e in it ain't bad for your body or for your skin but when you're in hell in that I mean look at the crisis that's going on right now like it's the same like ruining everything good that was going good for the medical marijuana program is getting run out with this cart stop these it's just sucks you know but how is that my snow that [ __ ] that [ __ ] works that works how's the bottom up still nice and yellow around every time you take a hit though oh yeah but it's not good or guys just killing [Music] that's pretty good I can't believe it Chase is really good my axe liquidizer man you did it the first video I made I messed up use the wrong wax you got to use a a decent type of wax to get you the best pass this is this looks as good as I might did it with this Dylan just Allah", "yLoe9ufP9vE": "are you guys so we're gonna do a lower leg locks with roll-on softbox want to use our set I saw the blue roll-on I've already prepped her skin with our purple gel and I've let it dry make sure you let it dry fully so it's your waxes and roll and it can stick to those hairs the right way so the way you want to hold your warmer is with a star pillow go outward so you notice is roller has like an angle you want to make sure the rule the angle is downward outward with the hair growth so I'm going to start at the highest point and I'm going to do it quickly just like that you should go in the entire leg this is the most effective and time-saving way to do it rather than the wax strip wax strip just roll onto the entire leg or at least the first half the upper half and so the rollerball is cool because it actually does not have a temperature dial like all of our other star performers that's because the heating unit that it comes on heats to the perfect temperature already so you don't even need to mess with it you just need to plug it in let it melt all the way and you're good to go so I can use the strip a few times in a row I'm just gonna use it about twice don't want to have her legs stick Eve this is our first leg wax ever listen this is definitely one of my favorite methods for legs chest and back as well it's just really easy it's really quick and that's probably the most important thing the time-saving because you know you want to fit in be able to see as many chains as possible in this excess off [Music] so the tweezers take this hair up here and remember you guys with the softbox you're not gonna want to go over same place twice I know the roll on

"APKSTn5zRt4": "hey guys it's Nikki and today we'd be doing an honest review of the Sally Hansen hair removal wax drip kit and apparently it's the number one waxing brand in the u.s. fa and so I kind of wanted to see what this would be like because I have used hair removal products in the past and I've also used Nair on my legs before and that has always been okay but there's always the possibility of getting a chemical burn which is not safe to do and I've definitely gotten a chemical burn before from using there so I feel like this is going to be a good thing to try to do an honest review form and I've also heard some pretty good things about this product but I wanted to see for myself and for you guys to see if this was actually a product that you should go out and purchase so basically in this kit you get six extra large waxing strips and 24 regular large waxing strips and so this is what the extra large looks like it's kind of hard to see because it's a little bit transparent well that's kind of what it looks like and here is the regular large strip I guess if I put in four am I sure it's better to see here's the extra large and here is the large so the largest basically half the size of the extra large strip and it also comes with this finishing oil which is supposed to remove any of the wax residue and also remorse dereyes skin so let's go ahead and let's try this okay so first thing you have to do is pick a wax strip I'm going to go with the regular large wax strip for now and you have to warm it up with your hands in a gentle way just to kind of warm up the wax and the selling point about this waxing kit is that there's no mess there's no microwave involved so you basically have a safe temperature to apply to your legs so you're not overheating and burning yourself while you're waxing okay I think I've warmed it up enough and you have to go ahead afterwards and you need to pull these apart China okay this is kind of cool okay there we go so then you have to pull it apart okay I don't know which side is the waxing side I'm assuming it's the Sally Hansen so I'm going to get my leg put it here and I guess I'll put it right here for you guys you have to put it in the direction of the hair grow so guess like that then after that to go ahead and you have pull in the direction of the hair very quickly and they specify that stretch skin with one hand pull strip off very quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth I'm going to go like this pull it back like they want me to and then make at the edge okay I'm not looking forward to this bar the stair it's so bad and you have to pull back really really quickly ow oh my god that hurts so freakin bad holy crap so there is definitely a good amount of hair here and my leg is super super baby smooth now holy crap whoa that is like the smoothest wax I've ever done at home by myself wowza okay just so you guys can kind of see I don't know if you can see it's kind of hard to see the hairs I kind of have these long sort of blonde baby hair so it's kind of hard to see what it looks like it's pretty pretty good I have not seen a wax strip kit that has been this good and honestly I mean it hurt really bad but your waxing yourself you should expect vents that are hurt so I also think that it's really important to use the extra-large strip too during this review because I feel like because it is so big that the results can vary based on just the amount of wax you have my theory is that it will pick up as much hair as the smaller condensed large strip so I thought we'll take a look and see if it has the same result as the large strip so I've warmed it up with my hands and now I'm going to rip this so you have to put it in the direction of the hair grow and then slide it down oh oh my god that hurts so bad Wow oh my god that hurt really really really bad but it looks super super super baby smooth my god that's a really really baby smooth Wow after you wax your leg it says that after hair removal apply a small amount of the finishing oil to the treated area with cotton ball or tissue to wipe away any wax residue and help remoisturize the skin so I have a tissue here and I'm just gonna oh that actually smells really nice I thought it was gonna smell sort of kattiline and it doesn't okay so I'm gonna apply a small amount to the tissue like they want I just put a little bit this is really really moisturizing and really relaxing and it's removing all the rest of your wax also reading through the directions I'm starting to realize that this isn't just for legs it's also for arms for your armpits it even says that you could use this on your neck area and bikini area so the box also says that results can last up to eight weeks and that obviously varies on the individual and it also says that it can help to slow the appearance of regrowth which i think is really really cool um basically it's hard to give a full review in such a short amount of time because I would like to see how these wax strips are going to look in eight weeks or even two weeks or even a week from now so I think I'm probably gonna do a follow-up video as well to this video to see how it looks compared to when I started basically in that respect I think that this is a really really cool product and I if I felt like I was going to like a fancy event or a wedding or whatever I think I would totally buy this again and use it I personally don't know if I would use it on something sensitive like my armpits or my bikini line because I feel like you have to have a high pain tolerance to handle that but if you are like hardcore and you just want to go ahead and do what you do and like rip off your hair on your bikini line and be fearless I say go for it that concludes my review for the hair removal wax drip kit from Sally Hansen I totally would recommend this to a friend or even family I think that this is a good product so far I will make a follow-up video in a week or two to kind of show the results so far and if it really is um kind of reducing the appearance of regrowth of hair and even if it lasts up to eight weeks or however long it might so stay tuned for the next video and I'll see you guys next time bye", "KypNADeYK1s": "[Music] do [Music] so today we're going to work on a solo arrangement of tears in heaven by the great eric clapton this song was actually voted on on my patreon page where every month we do a different tutorial based on suggestions and votes of my patrons so check it out in the link in the description below where you can download the tab that's on screen here too let's go and dive into tears in heaven starting with the intro so i think the intro is probably the hardest part of the song and it's also the most fun to play we're going to start here by spreading a g chord taking our index finger placing on the second fret of the c string and take your ring finger and place on the third fret of the e string now what you're going to do is instead of placing the middle finger on the a string which we usually do when we start a g we're going to leave it off we're going to pluck now the c and the e strings and you can use a lot of different combinations of fingers you'll notice what i prefer to do for most of the song is what's called forefinger picking which means my thumb's on my g string index is here on the c my middle here on the e and my ring finger here on the a there's actually a link to a seminar i did on this technique linked down below that you can check out another way that you can do it though is you can pluck with like the thumb and index or you can even just use your thumb to play those two whatever's comfortable it's okay and then we're going to play the open g string [Music] and then we're going to play open on the a and we're going to do a hammer-on to two on the a and then we're going to pull off this is really hard this is the thing i mentioned being probably the hardest part of the song and of course it's right at the beginning right but the trick to doing this is making sure that that ring finger excuse me that middle finger that's doing the hammer on is coming down on the string very perpendicular and then when you do the pull off portion you want to make sure that you actually pull the finger down and pluck the string so that very first part sounds something like that now if you're really struggling with it it's okay to take the other fingers off to see if you can get that hammer on and pull off to sound a little bit better and worst case scenario you can just play the two on the a and skip both the hammer on of zero to two as well as the pull off if those are too difficult for you so so far now we're going to play the open g right after that hammer on pull off from here we're going to go to our first chord change of it we're going to go to a d chord to do this we just take our index finger barred across the second fret take our pinky finger place on the fifth fret of the a string and we can pluck or using our thumb strum through all four strings either way works then we're gonna play the five on the a again then we're gonna switch chords again at the very end of this measure to an e minor to do this your index finger is going to move all the way down to the second fret on the a string middle comes up to three on the e and the ring comes up to four on the c with the pinky coming off so we have zero four three two we're gonna pluck that or strum through so the first measure is something like this now going in the second measure you'll notice the symbol is a lot frequently shown on the tab that 0 4 3 2 is in parentheses next to the one that we just played when you see that and they're tied across that just means that the notes continue to ring into this next measure so whenever you see that we don't play it a second time we just let it ring because the chord starts on the end of the first measure but rings into the beginning of the second and from here measure two is going to be all single notes we're gonna play the two on the a which is right there with our index finger already then we're going to play this little riff that's really fun to play you'll see the middle finger is already here on three of the e we're gonna play that and we're gonna immediately slide it to five so you'll notice on the notation there's that little line leading up to five that means we play the three and immediately slide it to five but here's where it gets even trickier right after we do that immediate slide we slide back down to 3 on the e so it goes like something like that so holding the e minor [Music] and then for the end of measure two we're going to play two on the c which you'll notice your index finger should be ready to go on and we're gonna hammer on to four on the c with the ring finger to get a good hammer on sound you want to make sure that that ring finger is going perpendicular to the string we don't want it to be relaxed like that that's not going to get a good sound perpendicular gives you the best hammer on sound and pretend that you're literally using your fingertip as a hammer and really hit it and maintain that contact so that sounds something like this that little riff starting with the five it goes [Music] and then measure three is going to be open we'll play the open c and open e strings together we're gonna take our ring finger place down the third fret of the a string play that by itself then we're gonna play a d7 to do this we just leave our ring finger here on three of the a take our index and bar it across two of the gc and e strings and we're going to pluck or strum with what's called staccato you'll notice on the music here these little dots above the chords those dots are a musical term called staccato which means to play things very short and the way that we do this is simply taking our left hand or rather a fretting hand and we're going to remove the pressure so that they're very short so we compress play remove compress play remove and then from there to finish this we're going to go to a g chord every day g index on two of the c ring on three of the e middle on two of the a pluck all four let it ring into measure four now and then we're going to pluck g c e a to finish that all off so it's a little bit easier there at the end here's measures three and four just so that you can hear it go something like and here is measures one through four so the entire intro part of the song should sound something like this [Music] now as we go on to measure five you'll notice now we're at the melody of the song and the reason this is so important is this is where we start with the actual words you'll notice it says would you know my name by the way one of the saddest songs of all time beautiful melody we'll talk more about that later but we notice now there are words associated so whenever you're doing a chord melody like this we're trying to intermix the melody notes which are often what's saying along with chords or harmony little fillers to make it sound more full so in this case on measure five you want to start playing the notes that don't have lyrics associated with them quieter and the notes that do have lyrics associated with them we want to play louder just to create that dynamic difference so when we start on measure five it's going to start with our g chord again everyday g index on 2c ring on 3e middle here on 2a we're going to play the c in e strings and then the g string nice and quiet then we're going to play 3 on the a louder because that's the word wood and then for u we're gonna play the three on the e nice and loud and for the word no we're gonna play a d chord this is a little bit of a tricky transition you'll notice it's actually the same that we played in measure one going from a g chord to a d so a quick tip is that index finger doesn't have to come off you can actually just pivot and slide it to bar across the second fret all the way and add the pinky finger on five of the a and we're gonna play that all four strings that's the word no then the word my we're gonna play the five on the a again and then we're going to switch to an e minor chord so index goes down to two on the a middle finger here on three of the e ring finger here on four of the c now that's measure five it's a bit of a doozy it looks something like this would you know my name now going into measure six some more filler action you'll notice all of measure 6 is filler so we want to play it nice and softly and it starts with the chord continuing to ring so that's what the little parentheses around the e minor chord are telling you but then it has the little line with a p which means pull off to zero on the a so what that is is after we play this we let ring for a moment then we're going to take our index and we're going to pluck the a string by doing a pull off so it goes so i'm physically plucking the string with my index finger that's the trick to getting a really good sound with your pull-offs let me play three on the e which is already there then we're gonna switch chords now to an e minor seven so the way that we do this is we have to take both of these fingers off the index goes to 2 on the c and the middle goes to 2 on the a we play just the c and e strings then the g then the a they're at 2 on the a and that's that filler so that measures something like this starting with e minor as we go into measure seven we play our c chord again three on the a for the c note there if i so that starts back with the word so the c is quiet if i a little bit louder then we go to our g chord another pull off we really like these embellishment techniques with this song so zero two three two g chord index middle and ring with the index on two of the c ring on three of the e middle on two of the a pluck all four strings or strum through them and then do a pull off to open on the a so this is exactly the same as the intro the exact same little pull off technique instead of doing a hammer on and pull off we just have to pull off so if you're finding that difficult again you want to make sure that you're plucking the string so you'll notice my finger is bent this way when i start and when i do a pull off oftentimes i'll let it go recessed so that i can get a good connection coming off if that's too difficult you can just not do the pull off and play open a and that's totally fine as well let me play three on the e which is already there the two on the a just add the middle finger back on and then to continue on with this we're going to go to measure eight we're gonna play a d chord it's a little tricky um you know d chords are uh they can be tricky and the way that i like to play this is the index finger barred in what we call a partial bar so what that means is my index finger is going to bar across the g c and e strings and it's going to raise off so that the a string is open this takes some kind of yoga for your fingers of getting that bend so that the e string is going right in that little slit so that you can bend off of it took me a long time to get comfortable with it but once i got comfortable with i never played a d another way if you're finding that really difficult to play you can also play it with three fingers stacking your index middle and ring and that's okay too but we're going to play those three strings the c e and a and then g c e then we're going to continue with this filler because you'll notice this is the word then of heaven and then filler the first filler thing that we're going to play here for a chord change is we're going to go to four and three on the c and e what we do is we leave our index finger where it was take the ring finger add it on four of the c middle finger on three of the e and play that just the c and the e strings and now the index can come off it doesn't need to be playing anymore i'm going to slide it up two frets to six and five to get the completion of that little filler so let's hear measures seven and eight real quick it's something like this if i saw you in heaven right and here's all of measures five six seven and eight should sound something like this would you know my name if i saw you in heaven so you'll notice i play those filler notes softer right because they're meant to be more in the background so sounds really good it's a lot of fun to play if you're struggling with some of those filler notes only play the notes that have lyrics with them that's a really easy way to make sure that you're playing [Music] just the song that you know so kind of a little tip if you're struggling with it so now as we go on to measures 9 10 11 and 12 it's actually pretty cool because these measures are exactly identical to 5 6 7 8 except for one note literally every single note is exactly the same except one note and that one note is here on measure nine so we start with the same g chord going to the same d chord but and then instead of playing the five on the a a second time we play open on the a which is tricky so what we do here is we just take our hand off now the reason for this is because we're immediately going to our e minor so it's okay to have that hand kind of come off but other than that other than that one note that zero on the a for the word the of the same it's exactly the same 9 10 11 12 are exactly the same to 5 6 7 8 which is kind of neat so measure 9 going all the way through should sound something like this would it be the same if i saw you in heaven exactly the same right so again we want to create those layers by playing our melody notes louder and more pronounced and our harmony notes our non-melody notes a little bit softer make it a nice differential so from here we go on to measure 13 which is actually sort of the you know the if that's the verse this is kind of the chorus you could call it section a b whatever it's uh the next part of the song it's gonna go to an e minor chord here so to do this we just take our ring finger place on the fourth fret of the c string middle finger here on the third fret of the e string and index here on the second fret of the a and we're going to actually just play our g c and e strings to start and that's a filler note you notice there's no lyric then we're gonna play four on the c and then three on the e which is our first melody note i and play it again must and then open on the a so we're moving that index finger for the word b and then we're going to go to strong and here it goes to actually a b chord and and this is kind of cool because our e minor chord that we play here if we move it all up one string so not a fret but a string so instead of being zero four three two it becomes four three two zero we get our b it's a b7 chord but we're working on it here for b and we pluck our g c and e strings kind of cool right so it goes [Music] and after we play that we've got some filler that's going to take place we're going to just play g c e a for measure 14. pretty straightforward 13 into 14 should sound something like this i must be strong and then we go on to 15. we're gonna play a d minor chord just like the d chord there's a special way to play d minor that you should work on um to eventually get comfortable with that's much more difficult but once you have it much much better of a of a fingering and what that is is this it's just the index and middle fingers so earlier when we did the d chord with just the index we did that partial bar right where the a string is open with this one it's even trickier because now it's just the middle finger is barred across the g and the c leaving the e and the a strings both open so that then the index can come onto one of the e i remember the first time i saw somebody play this chord i thought it was physically impossible but i assure you it's not and it's a very good way of playing the chord my big trick for it is have that middle finger come up over the fretboard a bit because i'm trying to stick the c string right into the divot here on my finger where it sort of bends backwards middle finger does not have much flexibility and so we want to make use of every little advantage we get so that's my favorite way of a d minor you can practice that if you're struggling with that a lot it's totally fine to play a d minor like this two on the g with our middle finger two on the c with our ring one on the e with our index both are going to be fine and then we're going to play two on the c and then one on the e for the words and care and then re we're gonna add the three on the e with our ring finger here and then at the end of measure 15 it switches to an e7 chord to do this we take our index placed on one of the g middle finger on two of the c and eventually we're going to play the a string but not yet so just have those two fingers there pluck the g c and e strings we're going to play open on the a and then we're going to add that 2 on the a for the cuz i so 15 and 16 should sound something like this and carry on and now all of these measures measures 13 14 15 and 16 should be something like this i must be strong [Music] now we're in a full e7 chord here right so don't move that chord as we go on to measure 17 because what we're going to do is take our middle finger off and then slide both fingers up one fret it's actually really easy to go to this a minor chord two zero zero three index on two of the g ring on three of the a and we strum through all four or pick all four again it doesn't really matter which technique whatever tone you're looking for then we're gonna play open on the a and open on a again so that's no i don't then we're gonna play three on the e with the ring finger b and then we're going to go to a d chord here for the word long belong and we're going to bar across the second fret and what's cool is we can actually bar completely across the second fret because we're not going to play the a string for a while and when we do we're going to need two on the a string so bar all the way across for this d even though it's only two on the g and two on the c for the word long it's going to set us up and so let's kind of rewind just a bit measure 17 so it's no i don't be long and then 18 has these two little fillers same little staccato plucking of the d chord that we did earlier right instead of being a d7 all the way it's just the g c and e strings [Music] then we're gonna play two on the a which is there on the full bar here then take everything off open a twice and have and then we go to in heaven which we're gonna get to in just a moment so let's go and hear what this whole thing sounds like measure 17 and 18. it goes like this [Music] now when we go to vin we're going to actually go back to the intro of the song so the very beginning of the song that we played we're going to play the exact same thing for measures 19 and 20. they're exactly the same as 1 and 2. so the same little riff all of that is exactly the same to what we played in measures one and two so that's kind of neat if you got comfortable with one and two 19 and 20 should be pretty straightforward but then 21 and 22 are going to end the song so it's a little bit different here to start with 21 we're going to play the open c and e which is exactly what we did on measure 3. we're going to play the 3 on the a also the same as 3 but now it changes we're still gonna go to that same d7 chord two two two three barring your index across the second fret of the g c and e strings with your a already threaded there with three on the ring we're gonna pluck our c e and a and then we're gonna do g c e now when i do this part when i play this i like to slow it down a lot because it's the end of the song we want to convey a little bit more emotion so when i get to measure 21 i really really really slow it down and as we go into 22 22 starts off the same way as one it's exactly the same which is uh excuse me that starts off the same as measure 19 or 1 not 21. uh measure 22 is the same as 19 the beginning of the outro or one the beginning of the intro and it's going to do that little riff but then it's going to go all the way up to 0 11 on the c string with the middle finger and then 10 on the e and the a with the index bard strum all the way through all four that's a really pretty g chord to kind of end it so 22 exactly the same as 19 or 1 until this chord and because we started slowing down on measure 21 we continue slowing down through this to kind of end it so here's what the outro sounds like starting at 19 with the then of heaven so it should be something like this then [Music] and that ends the tune tears in heaven this is one of my favorite arrangements i've actually done here on this channel because it's so much fun to play and it really makes use of those embellishment techniques like hammer-ons pull-offs and slides and the reason for that is because it's a clapton song and clapton's kind of the you know king of guitar at least one of them so we really wanted to to pay respect to that by including as many of those little embellishments as we can it's a really fun one to play a lot of bar chords and other things to work on and remember if you're struggling with it just play the melody just find those lyric words and you can still have some fun with it as always if you have any questions feel free to leave them down in the comments below as well as if you haven't already please check out my patreon page which is linked down below it's really thanks to all my patrons i'm able to make these lessons here on youtube and if you're a patreon patron thank you so much for your support i can't tell you how much it means to me i'll look forward to seeing what you guys think up for next month's tutorial and i'll see you then take it easy you", "jycNrR58Phw": "here we go so we did this painstaking scrub thing so right here if you look at it if you want to put in the work in the hours and you want to look like this after we shut the video off we thought we were gonna be smart and we were gonna just make it a big surface and scrub it down before it dried it didn't work out so since it's just a roof it's not really my fault but whatever um we're going to go over like this and honestly this here some of us just didn't want to come off like it's just kind of stretching over the body or whatnot um we're going to see how it goes but as long as i have a wax on it to kind of protect it for a little longer life we're going to call it good enough for the roof so now let's see what it does and looks like on the roof now i'm sure you can go on any youtube page and get a much better description but you're not you're here so let's see what we do here all right but like everything else of mine it is 20 years old 25 i think 25. add a little more wax on it oh i decided to go with i found this this has got to be at least 25 years old too because i found it in the same box i found this one so um and i like the liquid instead of the paste so we're gonna go with it like i said if it don't work we know not to use it down there trial and error baby trolling error i might be buying a new uh i can't say they don't build them like you're used to um let's see i think it's the wrong way he's going to watch all right this does not it just seems like it grows so fast i'm gonna hit the rest of it just because but um i thought maybe it would take some of this gray out but it's not going to and honestly we really try to take like just we don't have enough enough enough to do it so um we're going to finish this roof up kind of like this because it's just a roof which is the wrong attitude to have but uh i've been at this a long time now and so this what i thought was going to be a two-hour project has turned into a almost all without an all-day project but like a four-hour project we've only done this most of it was going to find stuff so i'm gonna have him do the same thing here so he can feel what it feels like to do the same crap here i was doing it though i know that but we're gonna put the wax on now there you go kid all right go get them no you gotta flip it upside down no no no no the whole pad the whole pad yeah there you go now no no not that that's a lot this is why i want you doing it not watching jesus crow okay so listen to what i tell you very carefully here you want to take this and do not turn it on because if you do we're wearing it all right so smear it and then turn it on do not hit the button okay there you go a little more now turn it on hold on hold on yeah smeared a little bit more of that green stuff in here yeah all right now go get here [Music] you can see that shine look at that so you can go down farther look at that you do see the difference though you can see it you can see the line that's awesome maybe we should put a little more elbow grease down there it's more user error than product error i think at this point but we didn't have enough of the the paper stuff only not to pay for the pad stuff to really kind of do the job i wanted to and honestly i just this was my test pilot up here to see if stuff would work um you know we just might hit that hood with just a little bit of it and then put these times because he likes the tone of it so we might just keep it like that so go with it you good okay no we didn't wax over there we can put more wax on it so hit that again and then we'll do it again don't scratch the paint just gonna watch your face because it flips up it's gonna hit your thing all right okay just do a little whirl like you're gonna do syrup on pancakes okay that's why we're doing it look we got wax on a window no no no don't that's gonna be hard to get off that okay you do that okay all right we're gonna do this real quick we're gonna do one more out so we can watch you work there you okay there you go yeah just a small there you go let it rip we got that part over there like a good supervisor all right so we're going to finish this up i just kind of want to get you on camera so you can see yourself when you're almost 15 years old and the enthusiasm you have for doing it", "fsKLyYsMkp8": "[Music] welcome back everybody I shared you guys what I thought of the wax liquid eyes are in previous videos and I gotta say I got a pretty good response from people it seems like people are really interested in this stuff which I figured people would be which is why we're talking about it again but this stuff let's talk about the way taste flavor-wise what does it compare to and is there a new comparison out there one of the biggest questions that I get about the wax liquidizer is what does it taste like it tastes awesome - it really depends on how thick you make this thick you make your base 3 milliliters of your base here with one gram of a concentrate will make a perfect liquidize vape juice so like in the other video I showed you which I'll show you right here I put it in my smock babe which I happen to like a lot and yeah this thing rocks and let's let's give it a puff and this stuff smoke so good in any vape it's it's incredible and if you make the 3 milliliters to 1 gram it doesn't burn your coils stay good it's really nice but you can get as obnoxiously baked with this stuff you could just be laying in bed and just you want to believe how big he can really get like I showed you I put it in one of these little tiny ones it wasn't a big fan but I gotta say my my one friend he's a huge fan of his and still to this day he just uses this but I can't I couldn't do it the flavor just was killing me right now at the rock and hardest with the banana I will say that there's strawberry in this now the strawberry kicks ass banana all day I'm worried I really want to try the pineapple I'm really interested in that and they have great I do not like grape flavor but I'm really interested in that it sounds like it's probably pretty good another question I got from somebody is what does the flavor taste like is it like what that that awful disgusting COFF medicine flavor that some brands for some reason thing tastes good no it's definitely not I remember when I first started using blue it's an e-cig it was an e-cigarette and I used blue when they were just went on isohunt on like a torrent site and nobody knew about that these things weren't even a thought and blue had a really cool selection and I had cherry as one of their big yeah flavors when they got bigger and they changed to the carts the chariot to the cherry flavor that they had today it tastes the cult medicine what and for some reason was a terrible decision on their part I don't understand why some plate is some brands think that that flavor tastes good get that artificial cherry flavor and that's what people really want to taste but long story short none of these flavors have that medicine taste they all taste like you know the artificial flavor that you want to actually taste it tastes like a banana it tastes like strawberry it doesn't taste like a medical strawberry but I did see a different brand on Amazon for this stuff but at the same time yeah I'm sure it's the same stuff but get the good stuff this stuff this is something you want to support but I get mine from blue dream and blue dream in Jersey is you know legit they got all the whole attire line up and if there's anything new that you know wax liquidize we can come out with blue dreams gonna carry it so I always Rock with blue dream and you're anywhere in like South Jersey it's definitely a vape shop you wanted to probably check out and all the vape shops I've been to almost nobody else even knows about this stuff cares to carry it or is too afraid of the stigma because though yeah it's for cannabis but you know these guys are actually willing to stick their necks out there and support a community that is strong isn't a bunch of scumbags like some people like to portray it so [ __ ] stigma and smoke", "aNDaoF4QxM0": "hey everybody welcome back in today's lesson I'm gonna be going over what I deemed to be the prettiest ukulele song in the world I posted this on YouTube a few years back and I got a lot of comments and questions on it so I thought I would do a new in-depth tutorial kind of explaining the chords and the strum patterns for the song a little more in-depth than I did before so join me today and we're gonna go through this song I'm gonna play you the whole song and then we're gonna break down each section going through the chords as well as the strum pattern and then we're gonna have a little chance for you guys to play the song along with me so you can work on the song at home yourself so thanks for stopping by and let's get into it so first I'm going to play the entire song for you guys in real time so you can hear and see what I'm doing as far as the court progression goes and the strumming pattern and then we're going to break it down into the left hand and the right hand and eventually put that all together so you guys can play this song on your own all right so let's take a look at the chords we're gonna use here for this song so we're gonna start off with an a major chord so the a major is played with our middle finger on the second fret on the g string and our index finger on the C string on the first fret and that sounds like this [Music] our second chord is a major 7 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put my index finger on the first fret on the g string and my middle finger will also be on the first fret on the C string and if you guys want play along as we go here to make sure your chords are sounding the same if they sound a little different make sure that you're in tune and also make sure that you're getting all of the strings to ring out equally as you go our 3rd chord is the a7 chord and that's also a major chord and that's just going to be played here with my middle finger on the C string on the first fret the 4th chord is an a 9 chord so I'm gonna keep my in my middle finger down here on the C string on the first fret and I'm going to add my pinky to the a string on the 2nd fret and that looks like this [Music] the next chord is a D major chord you can play this a couple different ways the way that I prefer to play it especially for this song is with my middle finger on the g string 2nd fret my ring finger on the C string 2nd fret and my pinky finger on the E string so kind of crunching all my fingers in here for this chord you'll notice my hand is kind of tilted a little bit towards the headstock of the instrument here that gives my fingers better ability to space or not space but crunch in here or this deeper another way to play the D chord is by compressing all three G C and E strings down at the same time with the pad of either your middle finger your ring finger or your index finger so try those different options see what works best for you I prefer this way for play the next chord is the D minor chord so very similar to the D major chord I'm going to keep my middle finger on the C star on the g string 2nd fret ring finger C string 2nd fret and now I'm going to have my index finger on the 1st fret on the E string and that sounds like this I'll also note that it's very important to make sure you're staying on your finger tips if you notice here I'm bending my fingers at my last knuckle here so my fingers are not upright like this my fingers really are bent almost at a 90 degree angle and my thumb is behind that chord squeezing the chord down so your thumb position should typically be intersecting the middle of the chord where you're playing the final chord that I'm going to show you is the Kord and that is played with your middle finger on the g string 2nd fret and your index finger on the 1st fret on the E string and that sounds like this so those are the chords we're going to use for the prettiest ukulele song in the world ok let's talk a little bit about the strumming pattern that we're using here for this song there's a couple different strumming patterns that I'm going to use so I'm going to break each one of them down individually the first pattern that I use and I'm going to be playing this with an a major chord so if you want to follow along this pattern is down down up up down up so with my index finger sweet spot that I like to use for strumming is from the back of the sound hole here to about where the neck meets the body of the instrument so you'll see me strumming kind of in this general region so the pattern is [Music] so let's just do that together really slowly here now I'm not really getting very big with my strum here I'm keeping it within the confines of the body of the instrument so that's important especially as you get into more intricate strumming patterns for having your timing stay on board keeping very concise with your strum so that's the one pattern that we're gonna use the next pattern that we use is kind of a staccato bouncing down strum so you'll hear this part when I'm playing the D chord in the song and that pattern simply goes like this so what I do is I kind of cut my fingers and do a little bit of a C shape and as I do that I play the chord and I release my left hand so that I'm still touching the strings but I'm not compressing the strings down so you'll hear the note or you'll hear these chord stop after I play it so that when you do that multiple times in a row will kind of give you this bouncing effect so I play the three strings for the D chord if you strum all the way through you got to make sure that you get all of the strings muted with your left hand so let's do that together slowly here so I use that in the B section of the song and then let's talk about the little quadruplet strum pattern that I use towards the second half of the B section so this part here that I'm using I use on the a chord in the B section the last chord of the B section so that strumming pattern I'm gonna go down with my index finger down with my thumb up with my thumb down with my index finger so [Music] so let me play that a little closer to the tempo of the song now on the very last time I play the a chord of the B section I add one extra up strum as we go back into the a section so it's [Music] okay so at the end of the a section you'll notice there's a little variance in my strumming pattern from the down down-up up-down-up so I just wanted to go a little more in-depth of exactly what I'm doing at that part for you so after we do so that's the variance there right at the end so let me show you how to do that so I'm gonna be holding the a 9 chord for this part so refer back to the chord section or the PDF chart for this and you're gonna be doing an up strum and it's a staccato up strum so what I'm doing with my right hand is I'm just doing an up strum but to give it that kind of staccato effect I'm muting with my left hand so to do that I basically take my fingers and I decompress them from the strings but I keep my fing fingers touching the strings as I do it so so the first 3 strums are on a 9 and then I pull my pinky off with my left hand and I do an up strum with the a7 so let's do that together slowly here so it's a nine a seven so that is the little nuance and the strumming technique that occurs at the end of the a section let's go ahead now and do a play along for the prettiest ukulele song in the world so I'm going to do this repetition at about fifty to sixty percent of the actual song tempo for you so grab your uke make sure it's tuned up get in good playing position and let's try to play this song together at about fifty to sixty percent of the actual song tempo here so I'll give us a one two three four count and then join in with me one two three [Music] all right so that is about closer to 75% of what the actual song tempo is now let's do a play along closer to the full tempo of the song and I will also include a tempo marking on the PDF worksheets that I have attached to this video so you can check out all of the chords charts and strumming patterns in a physical copy that you can download from my website so let's go through this now at full speed thanks for watching make sure you hit the subscribe button below for more killer ukulele lessons also make sure you stop by all four EUCOM where I have PDFs tablature and information on all of these videos with in-depth explanations of each of them thanks for watching and I hope to see you again soon", "ZHUEFLwEtMA": "welcome to another ukulele tutorial I'm Lara and today I'm going to show you how to understand chord diagrams and how to read tablature chord diagrams represent the chord shapes that we play with our left hand as we strum the chords and sing through a song tablature on the other hand shows the notes that we're playing to finger pick a melody we'll start off by looking at chord diagrams and I'll teach you five key tips to understand how to play these chords we'll look at several different chord examples after that we'll move into tablature and I'll share with you five key tips to reading tablature and finger picking a melody we'll look at a song example of a famous song that you will likely recognize now let's get started with our chords the first thing to understand is how your strings relate to the lines in the chord diagram the vertical lines in any chord diagram represents from left to right strings four three two and one so from left to right you can also think of it as g c e a chord diagrams generally show five frets so if we look at the squares at the top the first row is the first fret the second row is a second fret and then we have the third fourth and fifth fret the next thing to understand about chord diagrams is that an open circle indicates an open string so there are no frets played on that string a closed black circle indicates that that fret is played the first chord that we'll look at is c6 notice the open circles at the top of each string on the chord diagram this means that every string is left open we don't have any fingers of our left hand on any strings this is the easiest chord to play I want to point out that I'm playing a tenor with a low G if you have a high G on your instrument you can follow this entire tutorial just keep in mind that when we play our chords they'll sound slightly different because your fourth string will be one octave higher than mine now let's take a look at our G chord the fourth string is open the third string will play the second fret on the second string we'll play the third fret and on the first string we'll play the second fret this is the most common fingering for G however some people on certain occasions may switch the index and middle fingers generally for transitioning between g and other chords this is the finger you want to use with your index finger on the third string ring finger on the second string and middle finger on the first string the next piece to understand is that in general you will create your own fingering for these chords there are some occasions when you might see the fingerings on the chord diagram and we'll take a look at this but most often the fingerings are up to you now let's take a look at our E minor seven chord for this chord we have open circles above our fourth string and second string so those two strings will be left open we have closed circles on the second fret of the third string and the first string so we will play those two frets notice that I'm playing this chord with my index finger and my middle finger this is just one option I could also play it with my middle finger and my ring finger you can experiment with different chord fingerings and you might have a preference based on how comfortable the different fingerings are and also which chords you're transitioning from and transitioning to as an example I may want to use this fingering of middle and ring finger to play E minor seven when I'm transitioning to a minor [Music] on the other hand I may want to use my index and middle fingers to play this chord when I'm transitioning to see the nice thing about chords is that it's entirely up to you how you would like to play them on rare occasions you might actually see left hand fingerings indicated on a chord here's an example this is a g chord and it's showing two three and four indicating our index finger as finger number two middle is number three and ring finger is number four so this diagram is showing us that our second finger should be in the third string our third finger should be in the first string and our fourth finger should be on the second string the next tip is that if you see multiple circles across one fret you can play them with one finger rather than playing them with multiple fingers across the various strings this is called a barre chord I'll put a link above to my short tutorial on Barre chords if you want to learn how to play them I walk you through five essential tips to make them much easier to play let's take a look at an example of a barre chord this is C minor I'm playing the 3rd fret across strings one two and three I'm only using my index finger to play this chord another option for playing this chord is to use your index middle and ring fingers to play these three strings you can try it both ways and see which one you prefer the last piece to understanding chord diagrams is that four chords that are play at higher up the neck you might see a number on the diagram that indicates which fret to start on let's take a look at an example of a chord that's played higher up the neck this is a D chord keep in mind that chords can be played multiple waves up and down the neck you may have seen D as a second fret across strings two three and four this is a different fingering for D and it starts on the fifth fret looking at this chord diagram you'll notice the number five and the letters F are to the right of what is usually our first fret this is an indication that this chord actually starts on the fifth fret there are two closed circles on strings one and two so I'm going to play these two with my index finger next we're moving one fret upped to go to string three which I'll play with my middle finger and then one more fret up on the fourth string which I'll play with my ring finger the tip to keep in mind here is that if you see a number two the top right of the chord diagram then that number is the fret that this chord starts on if you're enjoying this tutorial please give it a thumbs up and thank you so much for subscribing now we're moving into tablature tablature is a form of musical notation that's different than sheet music and it allows us to read all the frets that are played for finger style ukulele when we read tablature will be finger picking the notes so it's important to have a bit of background on finger picking if this is new to you I'll put a link above to my tutorial on finger picking 101 where I walk you through some of the essential fundamentals the first step in reading tablature is understanding the correlation between your strings and the lines in the tablature it's different than what we saw in the chord diagrams let's take a close look at this tablature is displayed with the strings and horizontal lines there are four strings so you can look at these as either a down to G or string one down to string for the next piece to understand is that the numbers that you see in the tablature represent which fret is intended to be played on each string the numbers do not represent which fingers of your and play these notes that's often a piece of confusion so remember that the numbers represent the frets as an example we'll use the first line of the chorus from the song you've lost that lovin feeling notice the numbers above the bars that separate each measure these indicate the numbers of the measure and they don't impact how you play the song but they're there for reference for example if you're playing in a group and you all want to start together partway through the song then you can reference a certain measure to start on looking at the first measure the number three is shown three times on the a string this means that we should play the third fret of the a string three times moving into the second measure we have five zero five zero still on our a string this means that we play the fifth fret followed by a zero is an open string and the fifth fret again and then another open string in the third measure we have a rest and then two zero two so we'll play the second fret open string and then second fret again in the fourth measure we're bringing in our second string for our E string we're going to go back and forth between the first string and the second string on the third fret now here's what it looks like if I play through this entire line [Music] now remember that you get to decide which left-hand fingers you want to use to play the melody and it's also up to you which of your right-hand fingers you would like to use to pick the strings the next tip for understanding tablature is that you may play more than one note at the same time let's take a look at an example let's look at our sample line again and you'll notice that I've added more numbers underneath our second note there are now three zeros notice that they're all stacked on top of each other and that means that they should all be played at the same time there are two ways that we could play this the first way to play this chord is to finger pick all four strings at the same time the second way is to play all four strings at once in a Down strum for the first measure the two options would sound like this either or [Music] if we look at the second measure instead of playing only the fifth fret of our first string we now have three fives listed as well as a zero so this means that we're playing the fifth fret on strings one through three and the fourth string is open here's what this sounds like so our two options for playing the second measure would sound like this either or our third measure has not changed however we do have some additional numbers at the beginning of our fourth measure instead of playing only the third fret of the first string we're also going to play the third fret of the second string and then we have two zeros four strings three and four indicating open strings here are the two options for playing this measure the first is the second is [Music] here's a look at this entire line [Music] the next tip is that sometimes tablature will also list the chords playing the chords is optional and generally you'll want to play either the courts or the tablature sometimes you can play both at the same time but this can be a bit confusing when people start learning tablature so let's take a look at an example of this now here's another look at this line with the chords added in above the measures you'll see C F G and C if you were to play this song by strumming the chords or finger picking the chords you would use these chord changes as a guide in general you'll want to either follow the chords or follow the tablature if you want to combine the chords and the fingerstyle melody here's an example of what you could do on this line you could play the C chord at the beginning of the first measure and the G chord at the beginning of the third measure here's what this would sound like [Music] [Music] the last tip is that our petty OHS will have a squiggly arrow next to them and arpeggio is when a chord is played out note by note rather than played all at once let's take a look at this notation now we'll go back to our sample line where we had the additional notes you'll notice now I've added squiggly arrows next to these notes these indicate arpeggios when we play an arpeggio we want to hear the individual notes so instead of playing them all together we're going to play through it more slowly notice the direction of these arrows they're pointing toward the a-string this means that these arpeggios are played like this you may also see an arpeggio pointing in the opposite direction toward the g string that would be played this way it's much more common to play arpeggios in a downward motion toward the a string here's what this line sounds like incorporating the three arpeggios [Music] I hope this tutorial has helped you to better understand chord diagrams and how to read tablature now have fun with your ukelele and thank you so much for watching you", "JKtPE3HfL5c": "hello hi everyone today we have a tutorial on how to strum clearly you want your strum to be clear articulated where you hear every note and you have control of the strum so we'll go over some techniques right now to help you achieve that I like to start with my thumb now some people strum with their thumbs forever you want to eventually move up to strumming with the index and actually more advanced players you see that they strum with all of their fingers at once so we're going to start with the thumb mostly to show us how much power we should have in the strum so if you take your thumb I want to get it right under your string like it's cutting into your thumb yeah pluck it out you're not going to break the string I just want you to get used to how much power you have all right you should be able to do like that string out so let's flick each of them we got G C yep these strings are strong use your strengths and really pluck them out so that now we're going to pluck from this one string down into the next and stop on the next string you can grab your uke under here if you need ya same amount of power you see how my thumb is really getting cut into by that string you're going to pluck it down and stop on the next string you might want to push your thumb into the fretboard okay gives you a little bit more control if you push your thumb into the fretboard alright so you're pulling G down to C stop on that next string now you're going to pull down to the E string be able to stop on that string you're getting as much power as if you were plucking out but now you're plucking down pushing in that fretboard yeah your thumb moves back into the fretboard e to a and then a down so then when you play them slowly together each string is nice and clear now you can start going a little bit faster okay each you can hear each note clearly that's the goal if you feel that your strum is muddy that you can't hear the notes then start here nice and slow that's what a strum should sound like we'll try it on C right with your thumb if you find that once you play chords it's not strong anymore then you need to press harder with your cording fingers to make sure that those strings are all the way down on the fret okay now after you feel confident with your thumb then you can move to your index so I like to put my thumb and index together if you see from the side the index is sticking out a little bit so I'm using my thumb for power but I'm using my index for grip so strumming this way is going to give you more control as you learn more advanced strums using your thumb actually you can hurt your thumb you have more chance of hurting your thumb it's different people teach different strumming and different people like strumming in different ways so find what works for you but this is what I like to do is put the thumb and index together have the the index sticking out a little bit then you're going to do the same exercise get that index finger underneath the string like halfway down your nail okay so you're not picking with the top of the nail you're really using this for power and now you're gonna pluck out okay so for some people if you're not if you don't put enough pressure on it then your fingernail is going to slip off you got to put a lot of pressure on it and then also use your thumb behind here to push on that string like I'm not can you guys see how how much I'm pulling that string up here there you get the eye really pulling in sir yeah gee okay now see get your index under there try not to let the fingernail slip it's like if you're skating on ice you got to step harder on it and then a okay so when you can do that with your nail now you're going to do the same thing where you push one down into the next and stop so I'll move a little bit closer so that you can see I'm stopping I'm pushing my nail into the fretboard there yeah it'll be easier if you really put pressure into that fretboard it can take it that's our G to C C to E try to build a control where you could stop on this string I'm stopping on this string right so some people they're like they flick off and then they can't control where their finger lands if you don't have that control yet go slower press into the fretboard okay also sometimes people put too much pressure and they happen to skip past that that second string try to build a control where you're put the power into just that string and you're able to stop it's all fine motor control so that's also all muscle memories so it's just a matter of practice so let's go from the top make sure you're stopping on each string now we move a little bit faster that's how you get your nice clear strum so yeah it's keeping this this thumb and index position you don't necessarily need the thumb but if it's just hanging out not doing anything it might as well support your index finger okay now let's try the island strum right if we're on C we're gonna go down you want those downs to sound nice and and sweeping like a harp now let's go over up strum okay so it because you want the up to be just as clear as the down so if you have the same finger position and you go from the bottom string you want to get that same amount of grip as you come back up right so pluck up alright now you're going to pluck up and stop on the next string right if you don't if you lose the grip of it then you don't have control of the strum so you want to make sure you have grip on each string and you are using the fleshy tip of your index so when people say do you need nails to strum and ukulele you don't need nails at all because you're using the middle of the nail as you go down and you are using the fleshy tip of the finger as you come up okay so our island strum again see right the down and up are nice and clear okay so take your time and practice slowly see if that helps you get a little bit of a clearer strum and let me know if any interesting issues crop up and I will try to tackle those in the next video okay happy practicing see you guys 1 2 3 when this guy", "x3uCW6EyGQQ": "[Music] Oh before anything you start with putting in your waxed which is this right here and if you can see it has a roll on so basically you just slide it in like that all the way inside and it are you important to note is that you need to prepare this ahead of time because you do need to have it warm for about thirty minutes before you're gonna um do it so basically you just slip in the AC core do it in plug it in let it sit for about thirty minutes so this little B right here the little logo and I think you can kind of see it where it turns on there's a little red light so that means it's warming I'm going to be trying this wax on him since he has much more coarser and much more hair than I do and so I'm gonna go ahead and do that for him and hopefully he's a really good trooper by letting me try it on him first and then I'm gonna do myself I decided that I would show you I opened one of the little packets of the removal wipes and they really are feel like a good quality they feel cloth like this feel like actual cloth and you can kind of see it you hear it um I've had other wax kits that um the little removal strip feels very very delicate and I've had some break apart in my hands and so I really do enjoy the quality of this strip after 30 minutes you need to check on a strip paper to see if it goes on smoothly if it doesn't then just leave it for an additional 10 to 20 minutes and then if it starts going smoothly then you can go use it so this is the area that we're gonna wax um right here it's just part of a area that he decided he wanted to get rid of and as you can see as the wax starts warming up you can see a little pink show from the wax and so now his um this area has already just taken a shower it's been washed dried clean and so it's ready to apply now you have to apply it in the same direction as the hair growth and one thing I do want to mention here and maybe you can tell see how it's still kind of tacky I still had to leave it warm up a little bit longer and you can tell because it didn't smoothly remove all of the area and it was a little bit more painful that way so once I warmed it up very well and it was more of a runny consistency my husband said you could it wasn't painful at all also um when you were going to remove it you remove it and the opposite on the opposite of the hair growth so in this case if the hair growth is going down you pull it the opposite way also um my husband was very stubborn and he doesn't want to trim his longer hair it is recommended to avoid any skin and you can damage or also to have uneven hair removal you need to trim the longer hairs now here are all the wax strips we used in order to remove his hair and as you can see it's very well quite full and we used many many strips but it was it was successful it was a pretty good removal as you can see by this picture right here it did remove quite a bit and then after we did remove it we use the little finishing wipes and they're very good it's a very nice light fragrance and it's like an oil to soothe the skin after it's been you know waxed and irritated which wasn't painful at all my husband it was much easier than he imagined and keeping the temp remain in a good temperature and it made it really easy actually um it would have helped if he would have trimmed the long hairs but in overall it was a very successful hair removal and now I'm gonna try it on myself okay so I just finished training myself but it was very hard to remove first of all you can hardly see my hair second of all so the little that you can't see since it's so thin it's very difficult for the wax to actually grab onto and remove so there was areas that it didn't miss so I did my arm my underarm area and there were areas that were not removed completely that is one of the areas that I do actually have more thicker hair but even so it didn't completely remove all of my hair I would say out of a hundred percent it probably removed 75 which is still not that bad but not as you know in my husband's opinion he doesn't want to come out in camera but did he did not in it this did remove a hundred percent agreement that I don't have to worry about guessing the correct temperature of having to reheat it in the microwave or hurrying up and using it and then going back why did you have to warm it up according to instructions was thirty minutes it wasn't three minutes that I did the wax needed to preheat for about 40 minutes 45 minutes in order to be at a more manageable temperature where the wax would actually glide on easily and I was moving remove hair let's see I do like that it's very easy to use you don't have to worry about this slipping because it does come with a really really good um little grip here on both sides so this doesn't slip while using it I do like that it's much less messier than any conventional exes that I've used in the past all the spilling and the little spatulas or whatever you get a little bit here but you know that nothing remained up I did my husband's area of hair removal was pretty big and I did my underarms and look this is the little refill and it's only down to here and we did a pretty big area so it's only like a quarter or less than a quarter of the of the whole whack so definitely will be buying more for hand I personally will not be using it because like I said wax I've discovered is not for me since the type of hair that I have is not the type of hair that can easily be removed with wax um but for him he definitely did like it he will be using it again and like I said the racks the literal cartridge seems to last a good amount of time so that's gonna that's good and like I said is that you know you have to preheat it for a good 40 minutes 45 minutes which you know you have to plan out your waxing well ahead of time other than that I general I think I would give it a seven or eight for my personal use I don't give it anything lower because it's not really the waxes fault that I have very thin hair and my husband gives it a nine because it's very easy it was relatively pain-free I mean it wasn't anything excruciating like he's had before mostly because I think he's burned himself so that's good you're getting of the temperature and if it's okay or if you're gonna bring yourself so yes we will be using this in the future my husband well I won't just because I don't have enough hair for it to grab on but in general yes we're pretty happy so thank you Influenster think you beat for this awesome awesome product and I do awesome because it did remove my hair at my husband's hair so yeah I have a less hairier will husband and so thanks for watching and I hope I didn't bore you guys see you in the next video bye", "2JeLv3Y2-iQ": "welcome back everybody to clues customs so today we're going to try polishing up the paint so let's take a quick little walk around here while i'm wrapping my ice cream because you do not get a physique like this without eating bad stuff for you so we're gonna try to get rid of let me see if i can show you this oxidation stuff here it's this is i think just part of the paint stuff but i want to try to see if i get rid of some more of this and then really is the hood here so this is the the real paint this is the bad paint or the bat you know but i think it's gone gone but we're gonna try putting some paint on it i mean some wax and stuff on it we're gonna see what happens you wanna watch this because you're gonna be needing this okay so let's go back here and this is what i did i went to autozone autozone didn't have nothing i don't know if everybody decided you know what we're going to clean and wax our car today or clean and wax our crap car today or whatnot but they didn't have nothing so we went up on the roof there as you can see the the wax machine there we put some of this stuff on here it made it smoother it took that grit off but it didn't really take the crap off like it looks like you have dirty old like um mechanic hands on top of the roof so i went then to walmart you're gonna wanna watch this because we're gonna learn the hard way okay so come on over here so i'm gonna have i went and got some scotch brite because i watched some youtube videos and then i got one of these a bug sponge i got this here i got another one of these i have one on there and then they give you an extra one but i'm gonna need one for the final coat this is what we're using rubbing compound heavy duty cleaner this is what i think is gonna be our last coat and then i'll use it for my regular cars anyway and this is for the chrome rims on it um i don't think the chrome rims are kind of that badly oxidized there might be a little bit but i think with this and a little bit of scrubbing they'll come out fine and then we got this here this is just a regular old dawn power wash stuff this stuff i don't know man if i need a go-to this is kind of seems what i do and then if that don't work we're going to try rust lime and calcium so would i suggest you doing this on a newer car no so we're gonna do this on top of the roof where no one's gonna see it anyway we're gonna try it there and basically do little small spots and go from there so that's what we're gonna do all right so we're going to stop this so i can show you what is

snacks twizzlers what are they i don't know nobody does i do know that they're licorice licorice is also how an alcoholic describes a bottle of hand sanitizer it's not liquor per se but it is licorice trust me it'll get the job done you notice i got my michael jackson slash twizzlers collab jacket on you know what i'm saying to commemorate the moment let's take a peek i mean we know what twizzlers are they look like the braids of a redheaded person you know if you had this as your hairstyle you'd have corn syrup rose these look like what drumsticks turn into when you're on acid i can't keep time on my beat because time is non-linear it's all an illusion if you made a gingerbread nightclub this is what the velvet rope would look like outside you see all these claymation characters standing there waiting to get in the club speaking of claymation characters a really depressed claymation character would tie this into a noose you know what i mean is that too much gumby attaches this to his harness when he goes mountain climbing or do you think gumby free solos i don't know gumby is an old reference even for me i know what you're thinking you're like hey wax what else is going to happen are the california raisins going to make hammocks out of them these things are like a rope being that they're a rope why don't they sell them in like a spool you know like bubble tape they could do a twizzler spool i think they do sell like just really like long ones really that could be red vines i don't know i think it's the the word spool sounds weird it sounds like stool and splooge and it just sounds gross it's not like tape which maybe tape sounds gross too but tape worm i think that's actually a genius marketing idea twizzler spool yeah absolutely you know if you get them at the movie theater they just like what length you want and they just kind of like if you go to like a like uh if you go to michael's arts and crafts in my fabric what length twizzler do you want speaking of movie theaters this is true by the way twizzlers other than popcorn are the most eaten foods at a movie theater that makes me think it's not just movie theaters taking a hit during the pandemic it's also all things associated with the movie theaters like twizzlers or even movie theater popcorn suppliers conspiracy theory the coronavirus was invented by microwave popcorn companies because they're probably killing it right pop secret indeed what is your secret pop secret a laboratory where you're making coronavirus the fda walks in for a random checkup what are you guys doing here pop secret they're like just making new butters i picture it as like you know it's a conspiracy in that there's like a zoom call between uh orville redenbacher the dude from jiffy pop and the pop secret board act 3 or whatever covet 19 which is a conspiracy between the 19 microwave popcorn leading brands and we're here to take down big pop you know the mafia family meetings where like all the different families get together it's just like the mafia of popcorn yeah when they find orville and redenbacher dead in the back of a studebaker poorville and redenbacher when they find both orbital and because that's two different people orville and redenbacher oh i'm thinking of uh you're thinking of the wright brothers orville and wilbur oh i am i am i am orville redenbacher when orville ran reading by when orville redenbacher's found dead in the back of studebaker with tommy gun wounds to the face we're going to know that he's the one that's snitched we're talking about twizzlers right talking twizz you know licorice candy forget all that nonsense let's get down to beeswax which is probably what those taste like i don't get it i don't get it dude you know when you're a kid and you blow out the candles in a birthday cake and you lick the frosting off the candle and you get you get one lick you get all the frosting then try another lick and you just taste the birthday candle this just tastes like that back in school did you ever chew on the top of a pen um it tastes like a pen cap this is probably the first thing on snacks with wax where i would say it doesn't have enough sugar you ever think about um you know you're kind of trashing these but you could actually be a good spokesman given that your name is wax so you're asking me would i sell out like if twizzlers can to be and be like look we love your music we love you your snacks series we want you to give us a 10 out of 10 and we'll give you a million dollars if you endorse twizzlers and you go on tv and you say twizzlers are the best the best best candy i've ever had you asked me if i would do that my answer to that would be two million for two million i would do it i would do it for a hundred thousand dude for a hundred thousand dollars i would go on tv and tell the world my favorite candy was twizzlers it tastes if you like lipstick blender you put in one luden's cough drop about a 10 year old worth of birthday cake candles a little piece of a rubber tire and a stick of lipstick mix it all together then hardened it into into uh what it really tastes like a crayon it tastes like that it tastes like a crayon i'd rather eat a crayon there's something pray off about it i know you want to eat one yeah whenever you wear that hat with your hair you look like some kind of like 90s rocker dude what band are you in bro not like stone temple pilots more like um what's that bush yeah you're being a bass player i was actually the drummer of soul asylum i'm gonna tell you up front i haven't had a twizzler probably in since i was a little kid you know i don't know why i'm laughing at that so hard it doesn't look like a food product it doesn't feel like a food product it feels like it's made out of polyurethane it doesn't feel like it's biodegradable yeah if you put if you rolled up enough of those you'd make skateboard wheels i can't even believe that this is actually what it's like what is this even it's like leathery almost the texture of it i can't believe there's no plastic or like you know some kind of non-renewable energy oil it's like petroleum-based you good it's all good yeah it's okay though long story short i would never buy these i would never eat these i'm an empathetic person and i know that a lot of people like these twizzlers because of that i consider this generous i'm giving these things a three out of ten because personally i think they taste like crap there you have it legendary tactics i'll be very active even when i'm geriatric big wax i'm coming at you with that laid back maneuvering if you'd like to know about this pocket that we grooving it you get one what do you think you're so good why is it

recommended by travis eddie let us know in the comments what should we review next", "Tn5j3uIu8cI": "hi this is Jenny from 21 ukulele songs and by request from one of our fans I'm going to teach you sing it in the rain [Music] singing in the rain only uses four chords the way I'm doing it I do a C and a minor in there I have a C sharp diminished which is just these bunny ears right here and I have G C and that's it the strumming pattern I'm doing is down now and the pattern is C [Music] little jumpy thing now I found ahead and added a chunk so it sounds more like this that's definitely what a percussion might sound like with the hi-hat on beat two and B for the way I do the Chuck is on my down I just allow my hand the heel of my hand hit the strings I get kinda gives a cool effect but you don't have to do it could leave it out if you wanted there's also a melody tab that I do for the middle of the song and it's written out you know if you go to our website ukulele dot IO and click on contact us email us and we'll send you a copy of it I will do a lesson on the tab at the end of the song but suffice it to say right now that it is up here with the first finger on the seventh fret [Music] enjoy okay I'm going to show you a little bit more about the melody town I don't want to shift a lot cuz it's fairly fast so what I'm doing is I'm putting my first finger in the seventh fret on the third-string and that gives me the note of G if I put down here and then I play the open g string I have a low G tuning but you can hear that they're the same note they happen to be an octave apart but on how do they be the same I am going to be playing on these three strings and I'm going to place my pinky here and I'm going to use my thumb and my second finger my index finger my middle finger so the first thing I might practice is just playing each fret that's what we call a chromatic scale that's what you do when you go from white key to black keys on the piano and you play every key in order and you can try using different fingers thumb and index to kind of get used to that because you it does go pretty fast and you want to be able to use all three of these pretty easily then the next thing you'd want to do is play what's called a AC scale we are starting on the note G in the key of C which makes it a mixolydian mode but you don't need to know that but you could play E and then you go to the which is on the seventh fret so you go seven nine seven ten seven eight and I don't think you ever use either up or f-sharp in this song so it doesn't really matter in this song you're going to be using this note this note then what you do is you just practice super slow and you go seven seven and I think both fingers down [Music] because it makes it easier for my fingers to find theirs if I'm leaving them down in the court shape so both of them are down since I go from a fingers down a little bit of musical notation when you have the curvy line like this that's called a tie and it means you just hold the note and don't play it again it's the same pitch it's a tie it's two different pitches it's a slur slurs a lock once and get to it just best I'll call it a hammer one on you clearly or pull up it's that way but these are all from one pitch to the other that's a music notation thing and you can look at the notes above maybe playing a different instrument if you know that to kind of check it out but yeah I practiced it quite a bit I did it with the metronome super super slow I did it five or ten times at a time it took me about a week of working on it some guitar ukulele players do not like using the pinky for the tenth fret cuz they so they'll just slide their third finger there a ring finger to the higher notes I find that my pinky is totally fine so I use it because then I can be more accurate and not playing wrong notes but anyway I hope you enjoyed it thanks so much visi ukulele got IO to sign up for free ukelele

ourselves facials anything and everything that usually you can get done on a spa we're now doing at home so waxing is one of them so when i go and get my my self wax normally on my face i basically get my whole face wax but i get my eyebrows i get my lip and i get my chin those are usually the three targeted areas so i actually still can't go yet to get them waxed so i picked up today sally hansen wax strips i did a little bit of research on what to get and um this was one of them i think this was around 5.99 and i'm going to check it out all right so i'm opening it up this is for face and bikini i'm going to spare you and out to the bikini um let me see it says it lasts up to eight weeks inside it says leave skin feeling smooth easy to use in the on the back it says before peeling apart rub wax strips between your hands to warm the wax separate the wax strips oh man this is gonna be let's see let's see how difficult this is all right so i have opened everything up i have opened everything up i wasn't sure what this blue stuff was this is finishing oil oh i guess that's we put on at the end all right so these are the actual strips i was thinking like like literally gooey wax that i have to put on my my face okay so important it says before peeling apart rub wax strips between your hands to warm the wax now this is going to worry me how um how warm do we need it but i'm going to go it says to getting it good i'm getting it good i actually can feel it getting warm all right let me get the directions again okay rub wax strips between your hands to keep to get the wax warm i'm gonna do my chin over here you see this little see these little buggers they're white look at white hair i'm getting old i'm getting all peel apart separate okay i can feel it oh my gosh what size they both feel waxy all right so i'm going to put this one on here how long do i keep it on for you guys are going to see me peel this off and either scream smooth on one direction of hair growth and pull off close to the skin all right that's good enough ready three two one i'm scared wait ready three two let me let me put this down oh my hands get stuck ready three two one go all right i had a couple little hairs come off i have two hairs there i had two hairs come off with that let me okay let me do it again see i feel like this side is what maybe this is the wax okay all right ready this one feels more waxy okay ready all right so i peeled it on let's see how many little buggers i can get off ready three two one go all right that got way more off all right as you can see definitely feel so they have a little wax residue all right all right not bad that whole area there it's a little sticky but this is probably why we put the the finishing oil on right all right i'm gonna dab a little on oh yeah i can feel the wax coming actually right off all right all right so i was i was a little nervous is the first time ever doing like wax strips like this at home not good oh it's very smooth here i love all right so there we go if you're looking for some wax strips sally hansen very impressed i will say this i don't know if i would do my eyebrows because it would have to be a really targeted area but i would definitely do these on my lip and on my chin and any straggler hairs that i have over here i would do that on all right so if you're looking to do a lip and

this and then i scrubbed it so if you look at this this all is this is we're just using the um the buffer okay but when i use my hands i'm going to show you use a little muscle i'm not going to go crazy on the roof it's just not to me and him he thinks not doing it adds character to the truck but i want to protect what little of the paint is left and i'm doing bigger swirls i probably should be but if you do this here i'm going to show you here i should be doing circles circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle okay look at that see look at that see that gunk it just took off like it was like rubber it like took off like it just it really is it's taking it off and now i'm going to take my little where'd my little cute pad go my little buffer pad perfect okay and then i take this right here and i take this here same crap and just go over it and look i hope it shows it on the thing but it does such a good job taking off that the crap so i do a little more here now i'm going to show you and then we'll do it i'm probably doing it better than i really want to do it but i want to show it to you if you want to put in the hours it's going to take to make it right this is what you can do but anyway i think that's the right way see right there that little mark right there drives me nuts let me show you here but right there i mean look at the difference between this and that and look this looked like this so i don't know what this here like see it's just little swirl marks it's not going to be perfect but then when i hit it with the wax i got some clean wax cleaner wax mcguire is what walmart had um we're gonna hit it with that and see if it brings it up a little bit and that'll be about right it's not professional we're not looking for a professional i

another wax to grind podcast for all y'all broadcasting from the attic record store in millvale pennsylvania that's right center of the universe where there's nothing wrong if you want to do the butt all night long but what if you don't want to do the butt all night long i think we're going to go to lawrenceville i think everyone is a butt in lawrenceville but seriously southside are in the house you know what i mean i got to throw some shade at the uh at lawrenceville fair enough the history sure yes absolutely but a lot of people from lawrenceville actually do come to the attic and uh have vast knowledge about records and shop here so we're just kidding of course naturally um we're going to start out this week by talking about some new releases max is usually in charge because he is here and he is receiving the records and he's posting the records so max let's go through some of our favorite records this week we'll do it very quickly by the way this is our third episode of wax to grind we have a very special guest for you trey zombres and uh stay stay uh stay on board we're gonna get out the sleazo meter a little bit later so make sure you stick around so one of the best records this week is this one can you see it r.a the rugged man if you're into hip-hop this guy's been around since the early 90s speaking of sleazy he he was uh kicked off a few major labels for doing uh some notorious uh sleazy things but now he's back and uh he's better than ever and uh he's had a long career and actually that's probably his best record he's released yet which is pretty impressive so um that's on nature sounds and it's a really good record pick it up all right the rugged men all my heroes are dead it's got all kind of people from wu-tang ice tea cool g-rap chuck d vinnie paz what's up vinny all right this is a nice reissue that uh i would suggest uh even though he was uh i remember this is rocky erickson and he was the singer of the 13th floor elevators i remember i was lucky enough to go visit him one time short maybe about eight years after this was recorded maybe ten and uh he was in a pretty bad state apparently for a long time he was living amongst like uh he had a hoarder house like mail and they're all all the tvs were on and it was very bizarre but he could still record beautiful music and this ep was especially one of my favorites and it had some great songs like starry eyes don't slander me you don't love me not yet clear night for love i mean this is a hundred percent great songs it's just an ep but it just got reissued on alternative fox uh i would recommend that one if you're interested in any rocky's post 13 floor elevator stuff um here's a label here uh it's called on or on records from the uk they've been doing a lot of good uh uk post punk stuff if that's your thing like early creation and c86 stuff uh here's one of my favorite ones they've done the razer cuts but they've done uh the early loft single which is really good and uh [Music] a really great second single by the wedding present which is really good fast jangly post punk you know not for punk rockers but not quiet you know it's it was uh definitely things were changing around there in the uk and this label has been putting out a lot of good stuff so there was a lot of mod crossover at that time like television personalities is your perfect crossover between post punk but they were all teenagers so their instruments sounded more artsy so they had that mod they're coming out of the punk scene but they were mods they worshipped the jam you know what i mean and uh but they came out with something different now this was more of an arty scene more of a more of an influence from the velvet underground than the straight mod scene like say the cigarettes or somebody like that but there's definitely mod influences in some of these bands and that was really the only you know that was the beginning of the throwback to the 60s because you know the 60s weren't that far away in like the late 70s early 80s you know so that's when that first started and this label is doing a really good job they put out um all kind of great bands o-n records or on records they do they give you all kind of booklets info um extra postcards and things like that and and they're doing a good i i hope they keep covering that scene because that's a under underrepresented scene in the reissue series and i think it's kind of interesting how that genre of music like you said sort of like morphed into other things and combined with other things but retained its integrity so that it's sort of like you know you when you're making a recommendation to somebody you can give a solid recommendation to people that like a b c and g um it doesn't necessarily have to fit in that tiny little box to appeal to a large group of people well that's what you know the original punks like you know the guys that created creation ed ball he was in the three tv personalities or labels like dream world or all those labels they were the punks that were there but instead of like you know some of it broke off and and then went like harder and take it more to the punkier edge some of it went artier some of it was 60s some of it was mod you know it's funny how that punk spark is just and then you look at it now and it's so specific now you know and uh but this is the start of like instead of like uh you know staying with the motorhead influence or bands like that they went with the velvets and bands like love and bands like that and um it's an interesting thing it still has the punk energy lots of guitar very young uh you know they were still young but it's still definitely takes in a lot more influences than your typical poke you know if that makes sense great breakdown all right and speaking of which is the velvet underground now this here now this cover is from a concert from when the velvet underground played with the mc5 in boston the mc5 opened up for the velvet underground and tried to get the kids there to like tear down the hall and i guess there was a mini riot and then the velvet underground got on stage and berated the mc5 for being [ __ ] because they liked the clothes and that's what this flyer is from but that's not what's on here i was hoping it would be but no but it's even better it's outtakes from the loaded el era you know some people say that's their worst album some people think it's their best album it's definitely their most normal sounding album but these demos give it a rough edge that make it sound much better and some of my favorite velvet stuff is on here like i found a reason like the the original demo and then like the original rock and roll and sweet jane which actually had a whole another bridge to it which got cut out so you can hear how it was supposed to sound on this sounds great legendary outtakes awesome stuff i'll go hurry up here sun city girls long time um i first heard them on like like old skate comps they used to be on mystic you know it's funny now they're now they're world music connoisseurs they're legends now you know and they've had a long career out there in like arizona but they do world music now this is a limited edition of a thousand you get a dvd in it and it's really good if you're a sun city girls fan jump on that a lot of bands transition over the years don't have that type of life expectancy don't continue to release records that people are not only buying but enjoying especially when they go through so many transitions and style changes so that's kind of neat that you broke that down as well it's always interesting to see a band that can actually um that can withstand the test of time and so many drastic changes going from mystic records to this to work it's not something that you know usually people i want these records i want that records i want to sarah you would see them on flyers like back in the 80s with like skate punk bands you know and here they are they're still doing stuff they're traveling the world making videos making interesting music that's great it didn't work out necessarily so much for celtic frost and discharge when they took a big change for real i mean some people do like those records and you know everybody wants to change once in a while i am myself not a fan of the big metallica change going from injustice for all was a it was a deal breaker for a lot of people i do see some things in it that i do like but they change so much that i do prefer the first three records but as a musician do you really want to sit there repeating yourself to a piece of hand no but i think it's it's the fans such a fine line to walk a fan base isn't always forgiving about you know about change especially when they're married to like your first couple you know your introductions i mean the beatles albums as a band everybody knows uh in under a decade transitioned each record sounds strange that's a good point and it's really hard to believe that they knocked it out of the park on each record you know good points that is one band who would stylistically change very rapidly the stones did as well it was a little bit more of a gradual or at least it was a little bit more they had more of a history um as far as releasing a lot of records over time and having a chance to sort of move from you know moving and develop where they wanted to be at the time with the beatles was so it was so like i don't think people realize and how quickly they change right i think when you get a little bit older and you really and you realize yeah yeah and what they offered and changed and it worked i think it's difficult for bands to do that uh but so again i think it's a great recommendation and also a good history not only of the band but an example of that taking place that's interesting can you think of any other bands that like uh i mean how about van halen with diamond dave who i love and then with sandy hager who i'm not a fan i think there's a big one whenever you're talking about changing uh somebody such as personnel and a front person definitely everybody's equally as important but most people especially if you're not a musician musician most people if you're not a musician are going to hear the drummer and the singer first they have to be able to tap their toe to it it's gotta have they have to be able to keep time and they want to hear what the singer has to say and hear the voice so i think that is why even the best of the guitar players the bass players keyboard players when they're replaced sometimes it's not as noticeable to somebody that doesn't you know uh pay attention to that sort of a thing um but i think that's the thing about the sami hagar change yeah you know you could motley crew uh van halen um i'm trying to think of other bands that made big big changes you can talk about bonds millions oh happy birthday bond scott oh is it bond scott's birthday yes happy birthday bond scott shout out of course and i think when it's a case where a period of time has passed and somebody actually passes away so when people talk about brian johnson versus talking about bond scott i think we're talking about i understand having a preference for one or the other it's all about taste but when somebody is just completely removed from the picture yeah then the band goes on absolutely yeah for sure for sure you got any other new releases yes a couple more that's okay this one is isn't exactly new but it's new on vinyl to me the rat pack live at the sand uh you know mostly for the sami davis junior dialogue which i love also you know made most famous from the sopranos boat scene you know this record was used as good revenge on the sopranos were you a soprano fan i watched it all um i would have to re-watch to remember but it that would fit in perfectly yeah maybe that's just because i'm thinking about fancy sinatra making an appearance i love nonsense sinatra which we will talk about and another new band from boston banshee who uh are an interesting boston band to me they sound like if alice cooper sang for the stooges and a cambodian opium den it's pretty wild if you're a fan of like union carbide or stooges or fuzz wall they give you an interesting booklet it's pretty wild stuff it's been a while since i've heard a good sleazy rockin wild rock record man and i dig this record by banshee uh check it out if you're into um i don't know if this one's colored or not oh yeah there we go i don't think i've ever seen vinyl that color yeah it's cool and so um yeah that's just a good new record that i've been digging man it's right up my alley lots of fuzz this is something really rocky yeah cool packaging yeah banshee from boston uh check them out and then um locally [Music] i've been i i know you heard this because we are speaking of it we spoke about it in the last episode that we did with todd from the cheats but we are such fans of this record of this seven inch that is fresh off the presses and we're lucky to say that they're from our city pittsburgh pennsylvania and you know i could go on about this for so long i'm such a fan i know you're a fan too i just it would be you know it would be really really cool if we had somebody from the band to give us a little bit of a story behind i don't know turn on the magical record cam let's think maybe if we will ourselves to do this we can make it happen hmm how did the fat out my thing go down oh like a blossom in a spring just keep going funyun like a bloomer like a blame and onion apples look at this ain't no baseball games i don't know what well i didn't ever get out back now this is becky a.k.a hey mick jagger mick jagga from the chokers now you prefer becky instead of mick jagoff for tonight okay because i've heard a lot of people refer to you as jagoff i was just thinking maybe that you preferred that i didn't know whether to call myself mick jagoff or mick jagoff like nick oh like oh mick like mcdonald's jack off yes so it would have been a scottish jaguar yeah that's okay there's scottish roots in this part of the country that would have been very appropriate and jagoff is obviously very appropriate for this part of the country so yeah we've been we've been loving the record back yeah we read these names out last year i remember when they hit the store and you brought them in and we're all very excited i think it's a great record um we're familiar with the songs because we've seen you guys but uh what prompted you to choose those songs for this seven inch i'd like to first of all say that there's a hidden track on here but you can't really hide a track on a seven inch and it's called cantaloupe and uh i wasn't putting it on there uh people just think it's a mistake that there's only one song listed on the side b but uh we chose chris strong because it was uh i don't know it's a hit hot garbage also a hit froot loop probably my one of my top songs so yeah fruit loop is a pittsburgh uh anthem i would say and uh it's to my understanding that you submitted this song for a contest do you want to tell us about so dv had a power ballad contest so i submitted froot loop so you had to mention all kinds of things about pittsburgh but uh you know the fruit loop is a hook-up spot in chemly park so i thought it was a shoe and it's a great song you know it's about the right tempo i thought we'd at least get a mention and we did not no and then it's okay i thought it was mom and i don't like you i thought it was a bold move though for that reason that it's it was definitely something that would be a little bit outside of the box as far as very pittsburgh as far as the topic goes which is completely appropriate for what the requirements were but definitely you know it definitely has a lot more of an edge than i would assume what would be submitted to a contest like that but the fact that you submitted it is awesome yeah it was a lark it won exactly you were there exactly what if you would have won two tickets to several parameter shows oh well and a night in a hotel that we probably wouldn't have been able to use can i just say that any of these could be about pittsburgh what did it smell like tonight millville smelled like cooking garbage it smelled like ass yeah it smelled like someone threw away their ass and that ass rotted in the hot sun that's what it smelled like so awesome this could be hot garbage could be also a pittsburgh ballad if it was a balance yeah drop in some references about you know you know one day late pick up on like no like you get how about you could reference and yes and you could reference no one knows when the garbage comes on a holiday weekend since it was july 4. so now you got hot garbage out there and don't know when they're gonna get it our cd is coming out uh very soon too fantastic what's the name of this i think it's just self-titled i guess we didn't yeah it is because we never chose a title i tried a little contest on facebook we couldn't nobody agreed within the band i liked uh children of the corn hole the options were children of the corn hole moves like jag off and i don't like that and debbie does dawn's debbie does those are all brilliant but everybody's like the dondy's thing is too outdated i was like i like things that are outdated and classy debbie does classic though not outdated classic it's a classic i mean how can you update it i mean well what i think is cool about self-titled is a i always love self-titled records they are the best it's it's impact it is what it is out to my ears for doing that i apologize um but also you had a name change we did so that's sort of that's kind of cool because it is still kind of on the fresh side of everything right the not so fresh side fresh chip it's fresh too it's fresh to everyone who's watching this i'm just making a massive build reference yes i what to do i like summer's evening i don't know if it's summer but yeah it's really bad for you it is do people know do people actually think it's good for you does anyone do any douchers in the audience i have a hot water bottle and a rack [Music] but anyway all right so how many bands have you been in now my first man was beaverhead i was the bass player with that show i don't remember them we played one show and i was a pool of chill billy's yeah uh the drag strippers local honey spinster floated [ __ ] and chokers which are kind of the same band so i guess like six bands i might be forgetting something plus i've done you know i've done asphalt mother one oh yeah that's right inferior with you which was a blast yeah that's great it was a and you make a those were fun thanks i know i loved they're both two of the best musicians in town so likewise thank you yeah likewise yeah because um boy i've probably seen you play many many times always entertaining always fun i was just trying to think when did you start when did i start yeah like so when yeah like when were you uh um so beaver beaverhead 93 our wedding show at graffiti oh you played graffiti yeah it was so like the pay-to-play night oh god we all worked there so oh you were working there yeah i was a cocktail waitress there after i left the decade though or no no it went to a decade after graffiti i did yeah i did it was uh the last one it was on a test did you see the decade book where they had the list of all the bands that played and stuff no i did not i did not yeah there's someone put together a decade book cool yeah i couldn't believe how many times i actually played in the last month of the decade oh yeah like they're like six times cynics all those bands mount mckinley how many views have you been [Music] i [Music] rather talk about other people but so let's talk about you now so uh okay so you were always into music since you were a kid oh yeah yeah can i can i pull up a record that i was really into as a kid not yet or not yet oh man format do you remember okay so you watched solid gold right i did the marilyn mccoo years i did who was her guest house that madam the puppet right wasn't it what was that guy's name george something madam i thought andy gibb was her oh the pg's guy okay well the younger brother that killed himself oh man there [Music] and then andy was the younger one who was solo he had shadow dancing i think was wrong yeah yeah yeah and i thought he was he was at one time but i don't remember with him i didn't know if he was with dion guys i can only remember doing that that's oh yeah yeah that's right marilyn monroe yeah and then so the puppet was on there i remember the puppet from hollywood squares yeah i love madam that wasn't the co-host mate it could have been she was a regular he was great just think of that gas station an hour ago the streets of millville you also had various dj gigs correct i did yeah so uh what's your favorite dj gig in pittsburgh can you can you narrow it down oh man i uh i had a regular once a month friday at remedy i play i did every other friday night at mexico city downtown that was my best paying gig um i'd do velveteers occasionally i did a couple of friends weddings parties whatever i never like it was never like i dj'd 10 times a year did you do vinyl yeah yeah and it was it was getting tough man going up the steps to the second floor of remedy with all my records and my turntables and all that stuff it was cool i you know you know how it is being a dj if you're like yeah especially well it's not even that i've had people that weren't into what i was playing that would jump up and down to make my records scared yeah people tell me that my [ __ ] was corny and like it was rough i you know i had some really good nights and some really awful nights yeah and i just kind of let it go after a while i bought a ton of records then though and i don't find myself doing that much anymore because i don't have to like if i if i do something for someone else or do it for work i will do it but if it's just for me so do you remember what music you liked first that you were like man i want to sing like who did you hear like you're like [ __ ] that's like i mean my first i could do that my first love was billy idol yeah um my first like real love but also like my mom was a super disco queen so there's always disco playing and i love that too and i would try to dance with the solid gold dancers my sister made outfits for me out of she took one of my mother's handkerchiefs and a belt and made me a g-string and we were like partying when my mom got home and she was so mad oh really yeah because she was you know my sister was dressing me up and like you know solid dancer outfits which aren't for children so um but yeah i loved i loved the you know the disco era and then moved into like the new wave era um i got really into patsy cline when i was in high school sure um yeah you know i grew up in a town of 1200 people um the radio station was terrible it was like a dull contemporary but uh my sister would occasionally bring home some good music music especially when she went to college and she was a lot older than me so that was cool yeah yeah and what did she turn you into all the new wave stuff and she was a new wave new wave older sister older brothers and sisters or and i wouldn't and you know what i mean i wouldn't know half the music i probably wouldn't even be into music if all those records weren't like we weren't a music-filled house like my mom listened to like the size of the disco she liked um james taylor and anne murray well that's very typical at the time i guess so i guess so my dad listened to a little bit more music so when i would be at his house there's you know a little bit more but yeah we didn't have like access to records and things like we would listen to the crappy radio station and maybe buy a couple tapes here and there but we'd have to like drive a scranton to get music which was 40 minutes away just to get music because every little town seems like it would happen when like it's growing up because those seem to like the days of like every town would have a national regular mart or at least a little oh dude people it was so or even the local ben franklin or whatever what's ben franklin do you remember those little stores remember that i know who would have been freaking out no one remembers ben franklin stores or murphy's like mars they would have records sure they would have records in those little we didn't even have stuff like that we had a drugstore called hilo indian figurines and like cigarettes and porno there was nothing but no records yeah interesting yeah wow i don't know sometimes porno and records will [Music] i like those records before porno was available they used to make porno records that were like triple x what was the sound what were the sounds like was it just like well they were like stories it would be like nympho horny housewives oh and it was and then one was created like yeah and then one was like cowboy cowboy uh you know horny cowboy there's lesbian ones like nasty ac dc lesbo action all these things can i get some of these i was trying to find i had a couple set aside i couldn't find them today okay but i will um i will find them and make sure you get to check them out i swear i have tons of those like nasty paperbacks the titles oh yeah so much no [Music] and then they have like um uh remember there was like a paperback called the sensuous woman they made a record oh i remember my mom yeah they made that into a record with like disco music and then the sound of like bed springs like i collect i collect sex drivers i'm weirdo i'm a creep i'm moving i collect those paperbacks and they range from being suggestive to the worst dude the worst i found one that i gave it to johnny my friend i left it in his house hoping he wouldn't see it and he was like did you leave something in my house i'll kill you i had someone over yes that was a successful maneuver yeah yeah so those are terrible it was a terrible book really terrible they're all like what is it about gnarly sex and it's becoming the butt of a practical joke always like if someone's leaving something in someone's bunk or something check your bunk in your trunk for that junk it's covered well i think i was the one i was reading the other night i was reading the other hooked on swap oh i hooked on swap so it's about like a couple yeah okay so thank you it's about all kinds of couples yeah yes and then there's another one you can cut this that's called that awful dildo you can you can leave it too i don't care it's like one specific dildo that she's like like can't get rid of i can't leave you doing that sounds like a horror movie i mean doesn't it obviously there's no fdc in here but it's also like your name and your dignity so well we can always edit it out on stuff and let everybody else watch the the stuff that we can the show you know yeah all right but this is a sleaze episode so i have you i'm fine with anything i mean i don't care [Music] is so [Music] will okay bring it back",

like this to play chord E you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret 4th string and then you need to bar the other 3 strings over it for like this and god ii should sound like this to guys about curtains coming pattern key or joe strumming pattern hum a song we use knievel a hair that would look like this [Music] so now let's break this pattern into parts and understand how you can play it so this pattern is actually a combination of down down up and chuck okay so you have to practice it like that so down down down down so guys keep on practicing this pattern the same way and gradually as you get confidence you can increase the tempo and this pattern would sound like this [Music] so now down touch up down down up down down up down down so in the same way you have to practice this pattern on all of the chords so called G called L called D minor chord C and God II you have to practice this pattern on all the chords well because when we'll be playing this song we have to change we have to switch chords pretty quickly and only when you get confidence when you get a smooth movement of your hand you will be able to achieve different parts so then in case you're not comfortable with chucking you're still a beginner and you still want to play this song then you can play an alternate pattern that would look like this down down up down down down up down down down up down down knock down so let's to play this song I'm using a capo on fret 1 now this is as for my waist range but if you want you can skip it and you can play this song accordingly now one more thing which I want to update you that as I'm using this capo my chord positions will be changed slightly so for me called a minor would look like this called G would look like this and other chords will be shifted one fret apart like this so guys let's understand different sections of this song so the song starts with intro part and in intro will be using chords in this order so called a minor chord G called a minor called F and chord G ok so this is the part where we'll be playing intro melody as well so at one side you have to play these chords and on the other side you have to play the intro melody which we'll be learning in a while so chords will be played like this [Music] so-called f you have to play a single downstroke and then you move to chord G and you play rest of the pattern like this so so that's how you play intra part now the next part of this song will be chorus and to play chorus you have to play chords in this order so called a minor chord G called a minor chord G chord C chord G and then again called a minor okay and the good news about this part that you have to play our pattern exactly one time per chord on all the chords except the last one so on the last chord you play our pattern two times so it would sound like this [Music] okay and you have to repeat the same thing again and once you're done with this part you have to start prequels and in pre-chorus you have chords in this order so called G called F chord G called E and then you play called G chords 3 and called a minor okay so pre-chorus will be played in two parts so for first four chords by chord G chord F chord G and called e you will be playing a pattern exactly two times four chord so it would sound like this [Music] alright and after this we have to play down strokes so on chord G you play a single down stroke on chord C you play another single down stroke and then on called a minor you again start playing the pattern so just play two times and then you again start chorus part so there's the next part of this song would be worse one and to play worse one we have to play our cards in this order so called a minor chord F again called a minor chord F then called D minor then called C and then called E ok so this part is again fairly simple you have to play all chords exactly one time okay you have to play our pattern exactly one time per chord except chord D minor we're really playing our pattern two times so let me quickly show you how it will sound [Music] the [Music] okay and after that you have to repeat the same thing again now once you're done with this part you again play pre-chorus and then you have to play chorus part okay so that's the complete layout of this song and that's how you play different sections so guys now it's time to learn that intro melody and as I have told you earlier that we have to play certain chords at one side and intro melody is something which I have raised especially for you now if you can't play it then you can completely skip it that's up to you so intro melody would sound like this [Music] so thanks I'm giving you tabs over the screen and I'm sure you can relate each and everything so I'm gonna play this melody really really slow for you and I'm sure you will be able to relate different parts then repeat the same thing again so guys as we understood all instructions when it's time for the song play part so let's play this song and see everything in real action [Music] can you torture your ego give you departure no might even be one good you see a departure there baby good evening getting so sorry Hey oh dude you dirty

the nails on your court hand are really short this will make it so that you have really good form and the strings will bring nicely if you would like to see more song tutorials like this one learn how to play ukulele from scratch and see product reviews and subscribe to this channel for this song we will need chords e please play chords e with your ring finger please don't cheat and use the index finger middle finger we need those for other courts so please do see with your ring finger have you been a finger hover over not touching but hover over so that when you switch to a minor there's very little effort so see to a minor make sure you do a minor with your middle finger because later you will need F and all you have to do is put down the index finger it happens to me and almost every video will have my people say like why can't I play as smoothly as you do and part of the reason is that some students don't want to let go of the index finger being the dominant finger but if you play with your ring finger that opens up the middle finger for a minor so really when I tell you to use these fingers I mean well this is for your own code ok so we were at F with your peace fingers then we will need G or G you're going to pivot the hand inwards think about the fingers coming down from the top this one's not easy it does take time to build but once you've brought it many other chords are much easier so work on G a little bit at a time if you haven't mastered it and finally we will need a 7/8 on also requires the hem to become like completely pivoted inwards this is a really cool chord I think I like that it's a little weird okay let's get started there are three parts to this song the intro the verse and the chorus the rest of the song is just all a repetition of one of those so for the intro all we need is C and a minor two beads on each now you have some options on how to execute these two beats you can just keep it simple and do down strums to switch to or you can do the finger style I highly recommend the finger style because it sounds more like the arpeggios that you hear the piano doing if you listen to the song so we're going to assign one finger for each of the strings and that finger will only pick on that string so the thumb is on G index on C middle on E and ring on a and all I'm doing is picking from the top to the bottom and back up watch me do it first and then we'll do it together it helps if you have nails but it's not like absolutely necessary without nails it'll just be a little softer [Music] try it with me one two ready go each one of these sink winces is two beats so let's go to C chord one two ready go one two now switch to a minor ready go one two so let's do both those chords from C to a minor one two ready go switch if any part of this tutorial is too fast or too slow for you then use the gears either up here or down here depending on what device you're on and you can change the speed of the video too much like you're learning so let's try that again see one two ready go okay see a mine if you would like to strung through this one but they clearly didn't real quick so this song is in a triple feel so if you say one two three one two three one two three one two three that is the feel of the song and you would strum on one and three so let's say it and clap it ready go one two three one two three one two three one two three try again baby go one two three one two three one two three one two three so what you just clapped try the strum that so it'll be one two three one two three one two three one for the purpose of this tutorial I'm going to keep it simple and just do down strum speeds you can use the technique that you like best okay let's take it at the first part of the verse and the reason is that all of the courts here have to beat so you don't have to really like think too hard all you have to do is just switch to the next chord in the right timing so here we go see a minor C a minor one two verse go [Music] this second part of the verse is the more tricky one because you have some chords that only last for one beat so what you need to do is always think a chord ahead don't think about the chord that you're on think of a chord ahead so we go from C for two beats then then V and then move to a minor so let's try that one to see two beats see see see a Mike let's try that again one two ready go try again one two and keep going [Music] okay so let's do the homework I want you to always think one chord ahead okay want to burst go and now we're at the last part of the song because the song is so repetitive once you learn this you've learned all of the parts so the last part of the song into the chorus so watch me do it first and then we'll do it together [Music] so now let's try the chords together one two ready go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so now just for fun let's piece it together intro verse and chorus okay one two ready go [Music] you [Music] I hope that you enjoyed

the ukulele now as a musician tabs can be both good and bad on the plus side you don't need to be able to read or understand music whatsoever to be able to play them on the downside tab doesn't explain rhythm at all so unless you know the song you're trying to play tab will only ever give you half the story but if you're trying to play a tune that you're familiar with ukulele tabs can be a very quick and easy way to help you learn so grab your uke make sure it's in tune and let's learn how to read ukulele tablature so what exactly is tab well if you look at the four lines they represent each of the strings on your ukulele so the fourth line down represents the fourth string of the ukulele the third line down represents the third string the second line down represents the second string and the first line of tab or the top line represents the first string or the top string so the four lines of tab represent the four strings that's all well and good but what do the numbers mean well the numbers represent what threat you have to push down on which string so if for example there was a two on the bottom line of tab you would push down the second fret of the bottom string of your ukulele like this if there was a zero on the top line of tab you would play the top string of the ukulele open that means not pushing down on any of the threats like I said unfortunately with tab it doesn't give you the rhythm but if you know the song that you're trying to learn then it can be very helpful indeed so to learn tab I've picked a song that pretty much everyone in the world will know hopefully even without the rhythm being written down let's take a look at the first four notes all four notes are on the third line down which means you play them on the third string of the ukulele the zeros mean you play the open string and the two means you press down on the second fret I should think even without the rhythm you'll probably be able to guess what it is that we're playing so the first four notes go like this open open to open like this have you already guessed what the tune is yet well let's move on to the next two notes they're on the second line down which means you play them on the second string of the ukulele the one means you play the first fret and the zero again means you play the open string like this so let's put them all together with the first four notes and then we look at the next four notes and they're exactly the same as the first four notes then the next set of notes are back on the second string three and one so you play the third fret and the 1st fret like this then we're back to the open third string then we go all the way up to the first line the top line which is the same as playing the first Ringel and that's a third fret followed by an open string then back to the second string for one and open and then back to the third string for a two so let's play that whole section and then the final notes are back to the first string four one one open and then one on the second string one final thing you might need to know is that if there are two or more notes on top of each other you play them at the same time so let's look at those last two notes now we've got to play the third fret on the second string and the open third string like this and then the final note we play the first fret on the second string and the open third string and first string at the same time like this so now the last line goes like this so let's try and plate the whole song using the tab have you guessed it yes it's the birthday wishes song and that's a very quick explanation of how to read tab for the ukulele and it's exactly the same for guitar there's just two extra lines of tab to represent the two extra strings on the guitar open the ukulele teacher if you have any requests for future lessons let me know in the comments below until next time I love you all and I wish you the best", "7Qh2JQwkhjk": "[Music] hey how you doing justin here today we're going to do a lesson on getting started on our ukulele great fun little instrument these are i've only been playing a few months but it's really really good fun uh if you've played a bit of guitar the skills kind of transfer over pretty easy so uh that's kind of a cool thing and if you've never played a musical instrument before it's a really nice little starter one this one it's got nylon string so it's easy on the fingers the chords are pretty simple to play small portable great for parties you know it's a really good little instrument in this lesson i want to show you how to tune the thing how to hold it how to strum it i'm going to show you four really simple chords and uh give you some progressions to put those chords in so you can play some tunes that's the aim at a little less than a day so first thing getting your uke in tune really really important nylon strings tend to go out of tune a bit so i would recommend getting something like a clip-on tuner or something that that that is there all the time so you can tune up real quick you know rather than having to get a tuner out and do all of that sort of stuff so either a little clip-on tuner this particular uke has a built-in tuner um this is a mate and uh ukulele australian guitar company uh makes great instruments all round you want to check them out mate m-a-t-o-n dot com dot a use their website but uh if you're looking for a uke this is a great one it doesn't matter what one you do this one's a i should mention this is a concert sized uke there's a soprano uke which is a lot smaller same tuning although sometimes they tune the smaller ones up a tone from what i'm going to show you um but uh you know and there's a couple of bigger ones as well but uh so this one's a constant one if you wanted to get one this this size so the tuning is c sorry g c e a and it seems to be commonly called when i looked it up my dog has fleas i don't know where they get that name from but you can hear that the fourth string which is the one closest to the ceiling is actually the highest note so it's kind of high low getting higher that's going from the top down okay and i mean physically down okay the the string closest to the floor is the one i call the first string so first string second string third string and fourth string okay so from the ground it would be a e c and g and from the ceiling down g c e a okay now like i said i really recommend that you get a tuner if you don't have a tuner i'm going to play the notes for you now so you can tune up so this would be the top string or string four this is the note g okay and now to the third string which is the note c this is the lowest note on the uke [Music] and to the second string which is the note e [Music] and now to the first string the one closest to the ground the note a okay so when you pick it up and strum it dog has fleas that's what you want to be hearing okay so that's first really important thing getting your yukin tune second thing holding the uke now it makes sense to me that the uk should be stable and not supported by this hand so that means i'd have to support it with this hand but just supporting it with this hand and leaving this one free means i've got to hold it so tight i can't strum very freely and that's no good and if i just support it with this hand then i can't change chords so really it's a bit of a balancing act here where some of the weight of the neck is held by your hand that you're fretting the chord which is quite different to guitar on guitar you would never be holding the neck the neck should just be completely stationary and it does make kind of changing chords a little trickier when you're having to support the neck a little bit okay and otherwise it's just your forearm kind of holding the ute down i have seen a few people talk about being able to hold the uke like that and play quite freely but you know i i haven't been able to get it together that quickly so you know it might be difficult for you to one thing i do find especially when i first very first started out i just rested the uke on my lap like it was a guitar and now my strumming hand feels quite free and i'm not kind of having to hold the neck up so much so you might want to try that as well it doesn't really matter whichever way you want to do it you know you want to be kind of holding it up quite high it's not like a guitar where you'd be playing it right down on your left that feels pretty weird so i'm going to have a little bit further up but it's really it's what's comfortable for you um i think if i was going to play it standing up i would almost certainly use a strap you could i mean they're so light and small you could use a bit of string you know it wouldn't be a big deal but so generally you're just using your forearm to hold the uke against your body and a little bit of support from that hand okay so that's first thing that you want to get sorted out is just that you know how you're going to hold it now strumming normally with uq strum with your first finger okay there are other techniques and you can do finger style and all sorts of stuff but to start off with you want to be just using your first finger and interestingly you strum kind of around where the neck meets the body of the uke right it's not like guitar where you're back here further it's more here okay and i'd recommend just starting off just doing four down strums with your first finger and then get used to doing some up strokes and making sure that your finger's not getting caught on the strings and then doing down up down up down up down up real common kind of patterns will be like one two and three and four down down up down up down that kind of pattern works really great on you but there's you know there's lots of different kind of strumming patterns you can use like on the guitar you know there's that's one of the things that you want to be studying as you kind of progress is learning different strumming patterns and different ways of playing it but to start off with just don't don't be all stressed just first fingers strumming around the joint of the neck and the body of you strumming it up and down right that's all you need to really be worrying about to start off with so let's go to a close-up and check out your first four chords [Music] so the first chord we're looking at is a c chord and all we need to do to play a c chord is put our third finger in the third fret of string one that's the one click the string one is the one closest to the ground okay so open open open third fret okay this is a c chord okay very very easy okay another really really easy one a minor all we need to do is put our second finger in the second fret of the top string or string four okay so second open open open just make sure your second finger is not laying over and muting the third string there nice using the tips of your fingers that'll be an a minor chord so c a minor now from a minor we can get to f really easy i know f chord on guitar is a bit of a nightmare but on the uke all you do you started with the a minor you put your first finger down in the first fret of the second string and you leave your second finger down so you've got second fret open first fret open and we've got an f chord okay so start with the first finger first fret second string second finger second fret fourth string [Music] that one we've got that's an f chord okay and the last chord we're going to look at today is this one and this one is a g chord i can hear some of your guitar players go no it's a d chord well it looks like a d chord but on a uke it's a g chord okay open first finger's going in the second fret of the third string third finger is going in the third fret of the second string and second finger is going down in the second fret of the first string okay first finger second finger third finger okay this is a g chord so we've got c a minor f g i'd recommend doing that as a little exercise to start off with and just getting used to those chords c a minor f g and back to c just using those four chords that we learned there are hundreds and i actually mean hundreds of songs that you can play now all you want to do is start off learning some chord sequences i can't teach you the actual songs and name them because then i get into copyright problems i've got to get clearances and it gets all complicated so i'm going to put a list of songs up on the website okay that use these particular chord sequences because i can get away with that so first really common chord sequence that you're going to get is going from the c chord to the g chord to the a minor and to the f okay c g a minor to f now just i'm just using my thumb here just because it's really easy for me to hold the you can kind of strum with my thumb you probably want to be using your first finger okay c g a minor two f okay now this chord sequence is used so much it's insane some of you might have seen the axis of awesome doing this little four chords uh little medley of different songs that use it so this is that chord sequence right so if you want to dig that up that video out you know and check out all of the songs that they do and again you can google it or i'll put a list up on my website you know that that chord sequence it's actually called a one five six four okay one five six four that's the name of the chord segment but there are others even that the chord sequence i showed you at the beginning there's lots of songs that use this having this one chord c to a minor [Music] f two g hundreds of maybe i can't think of hundreds of those but lots and lots of songs use that chord sequence as well right so it's a that's what i would recommend for the uk to start if you're gonna get started on the ukulele rather than trying to learn like loads of different chords and any sort of fancy stuff check out those four chords get really confident with them and confident with your strumming and once you've got that together that's kind of the thing that you need if you're playing at a party or whatever you want to have a a good repertoire of tunes that are really easy that you can play if you've had a couple of beers and it's it's no kind of stress and you're not kind of getting all complicated with it you know so that's that's what i'd recommend to starting off with on the ukulele um i'm going to see for plenty more lessons i'm going to do some songs and some more videos with some more complicated chords but as i said for getting started on the uke you've got enough to get yourself going so uh have fun on that it's a fantastic i really really enjoying the uk it's such a laugh i hope you enjoy as much as i do and i'll see you for plenty more lessons very soon take care of yourselves bye-bye you", "MBBmUVqM6Vw": "[Music] Aloha everyone today we have a tutorial on how to chuck so Chucky is that percussive sound that you can make while you're strumming and it's an important tool to have because it really adds a lot of rhythm and that sense of percussion to your ukulele playing almost like you have a little drummer in your one-person band here so today we're gonna walk through the steps of how you learn to chuck so essentially what you're doing and chucking is you are strumming yeah you are making sound on your strings and then you are taking the heel of your hand and you are swishing the strings right you are crushing the sound and actually you're moving those ringing strings against the fret board and it makes a smack kind of sound and it actually sounds like a chick so that's that's why I think you call it checking some people call it chunking that's cool too but to me it sounds more like so I call it Chucky okay so let's walk through that slowly right you can strum with all fingers you can strum with one finger doesn't matter it's a strum he'll to the hand right strum mute strum push those strings into the fretboard strum okay now we just do that a little bit faster and a little bit faster until it gets crisp okay a little faster strong you okay have it a little bit faster than that okay and then if you can get even faster than that and get the timing just right then you get almost no sound and you just get that smack okay it's just a matter of practicing that speed that adjusting that timing until it is really just that strum and then you get that smack down and make that percussive sound I find that students sometimes have trouble getting enough sound before they mute they're so excited to mute that they just start muting right away you need to get that sound first you need to let the strings ring before you then clamp down on it okay so the way to practice is really to go slow let it ring mute ring mute ring a little faster a little faster than that right try to get that smack it's like you're just clamping down right away okay that's how you achieve your Chuck now how do we use the Chuck let's learn the chucking strum now okay so what we do with the chucking strum we're essentially doing a regular down-up strum you're just going down up down up but on every other down you're going to do a Chuck and a Chuck is always on the down strum so you're gonna go down up now you're going to Chuck on the way down Chuck and then come back up so down Chuck down [Music] Chuck and essentially it serves as like a drummer hitting the two and four in the background like one two three four one two three four so we're doing one two three so the timing should be as if you were just playing three four and but it takes a little while to just get fluid with adding the Chuck in there in time so let's try that slowly really slowly go one and Chuck Chuck Chuck we're just doing an open string let's try it on a C be a little bit friendlier sounding ready okay we can practice this with different tutorials we use it and build me a buttercup and banana pancakes and you could check below I'll have links for the different tutorials you could practice that with you can also use the Chuck in the island strum the Riptide tutorial is good for practicing that that's a more complicated strum essentially what you're doing is the island strum is down down up up down up again you're replacing the two and four beads with a Chuck so it sounds like down chuck up Chuck it's more complicated so you got to take it slow okay so let's do the first half we're gonna go down Chuck pop again and down Chuck one more time down chuck up now we do the second half will go up Chuck up let's just do the second half drop your hand up Chuck again ready and up Chuck let's put the two halves together ready down Chuck up drop that's where you want to get to it adds a lot of rhythm compared to just the regular lindstrom right regular island strum has rhythm when you add that Chuck then you can you can rock with it okay so that's an introduction to the Chuck and the chucking strum and the chucking island strum so hopefully that's a good foundation for you for adding percussion and rhythm to your ukulele playing happy checking everyone and I'll see you out there happy practicing ciao [Music]", "zq5Q0IsMn5Y": "hey everyone its Katie with one music school and today I'm going to teach you some basic finger picking patterns and by the end of this lesson you will be able to finger pick any song that you like now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to finger pick on quarter notes so it's just the actual beat one two three four is this incredibly important because once we add something called a metronome it's going to make so much more sense and it's going to make your finger picking cleaner when you actually try it so I'm going to use a metronome that I have on my phone it's called seven metronome and I like it because it's clean it's simple and it's free you can find a bunch of different metronomes that are free on your app store also online it's a great resource to have and I highly encourage that you practice with a metronome regularly so the first chord that I'm going to be using is AC chord I'm going to take finger number three and place it on the third fret of the a string and then my right hand is going to be in charge of a certain string and I say that because it's not going to move to a different string for this basic finger picking exercise my thumb is never going to leave the C string finger number one or the pointer finger is never going to leave that a string and my middle finger is going to be in charge of the a string so I'm going to pluck with my thumb so I apply a little bit of pressure and I pluck down on the C string and then with my pointer in middle I'm going to be plucking up like that so it would be one two three four one two three four now I'm going to add the metronome that's going to be very important [Music] now the second thing you have to do is subdivide so you take that beat and you chop it into smaller equal parts so the next subdivision of a quarter note would be an eighth note so 1 2 3 4 becomes 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 and so the basic finger picking pattern we're basically going to double it in speed 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 it let's try that with the metronome [Music] so the next step would be to add your pointer finger so first just on the quarter notes it would be 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so we have thumb pointer middle pointer and then we go back to thumb pointer middle pointer let's try it with the metronome [Music] [Music] now you can use that same finger picking pattern while you're switching courts it's actually really quite simple I just avoid this string right here that's tuned to the high G if it's tuned to a low G it sounds just a little bit more fluid you could still pick with this one but just for the basic part we're just going to focus on these three strings right here so I'm gonna choose a chord progression from C to F 2 C to G and what's going to happen is I'm going to hold my fingers in the court position so just in case my thumb accidentally plucks this string right here it's going to sound like you meant to do it because your fingers are in the chord so you really can't loose let's start with the quarter note finger picking pattern one two three four one two three four F one two three four one two three four back to C one two three four one two three four G one two three four one two three four let's try it with the metronome [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's it those are two basic finger picking patterns that you can use as a beginner of course there are more complicated ones that you can use you can switch between quarter notes and between eighth notes to switch it up it's really really simple just start off slow don't try to go too fast and eventually you can always speed it up I'll see you the next one bye", "vkSUiVkpJzg": "[Music] hello today we're going to work on a solo rendition of you've got a friend by james taylor and carol king this was voted on over at my patreon page where each month we do a different tutorial based on suggestions of the patrons so check that out in the link down below where you can also find a download of this tab but let's go ahead and dive into you've got a friend to start here we want to make sure that we're going to play the notes with lyrics associated louder because those are going to be the melody notes as far as a technique i like to use my thumb throughout this whole song just to get good articulation on the melody now to start we're going to play when you're down we're going to play open on the c string then two on the c string and you can use your middle finger there and then we're going to play the word down and for down here we're just going to move our middle finger up to two on the g play our g c and e strings and you can actually stop your thumb on the a string don't play it but have it collide with it to stop it and that gives us now just a moment ago i mentioned play the lyrics louder these all have lyrics with it then the next chord here 2 0 0 0 which is an a minor which we're already playing you want to strum softly so i like to use sort of the side of my thumb and the reason we're doing this softly is because there's no lyric associated to it so it's a little filler then we're going to play and trouble and to play this we're going to play open on the e string one on the e string with the index and then we're going to jump that one on the e string with the index up to one on the g string with the index and our middle finger is going to cross down to two on the c string we apply the g c and e strings again stopping on the a string so a quick tip is it works really well as you're strumming through to have that finger actually go into the e and then just stop so that it doesn't ring because the melody notes here on the e string but then we'll notice right after that we're going to play through the full chord so add your ring finger on two of the a nice and quiet because it's a filler no lyrics then we're going to play and you need a helping hand and to play this we're going to play open on the a then we're going to play 2 on the a and i like to use my ring finger here the reason for that is the next chord for the word knead i'm going to slide that ring finger up to 3 on the a i'm going to add the index finger here to 2 on the g strum through all four strings then i'm going to play the 3 on the a again for the word uh and now these two fingers in their location all that they have to do is both slide down one fret so the index goes to one on the g the ring goes to two on the a and just add my middle finger here to two on the c and strum through all four strings and that gives us the word help and then ing for helping hand is going to be ring finger off for open a and then for the word hand all that i do is take my middle finger off and slide my index finger up one fret to two on the g string i'm going to strum my g c and e strings stopping on the a now the next thing after this is we're going to be doing what's called a harmonic now if you haven't played a harmonic before i actually have a tutorial down in the description below but we're going to use a harmonic on the 12th fret on the c e and a strings for a nice little fill quick tip with harmonics make sure that you're just touching the string not compressing it just touching it right over the fret wire so not in between but actually over the wire itself and as you feel the string start to vibrate you remove your finger and then the last word there is going to be the word and for the end of that bar so let's go ahead and hear all of this the first four measures including the pickup bar and i'm going to say the words as we're playing it so it should be something like this when you're down [Music] now we go on to the next set here which is going to be nothing we're going to play a d minor chord and to play this chord we can take our middle finger place on two of the g ring finger on two of the c and index on one of the e string alternatively if you're comfortable with it we can also do the middle finger bar on the g and the c index on one of the e this one's a little bit more challenging but both work for now i'll play the slightly easier one that's going to be enough so i stop on the a string and i'm going to play the one on the e again for the word in nothing then i strum through the whole chord all four strings with my thumb nice and soft no lyric i'm going to play the word whoa open on the a then for measure six to start here i'm going to play this really cool interesting chord and all that i have to do is take my ring finger off and move my middle finger to two on the c so i have zero on the g two on the c with the middle finger one on the e with the index and open on the a strum through all four strings and that's enough and then for in i'm going to play three on the e and then open on the e taking my middle and excuse me my ring and index finger is off open on the a three on the e and then we'll play two on the c i'm going to slide it up to four on the c so i'm going to maintain pressure with that middle finger and slide it up and that's for the word right so it goes nothing is going right now here on measure seven we have a little fill that's supposed to be sort of like a guitar solo only on the ukulele and the way that we're going to play this is take your index and barred across three on the e and the a strings we're going to play the three on the e hammer on to five on the e remember to get a good hammer on sound make sure you're getting right up next to that fret wire and making sure that your finger's really perpendicular to the string so that you can get a good sound for more on hammer ons i've got a link down below let me do a hammer on and then we'll play three on the a and then five on the a with the ring and then three on the a again you see we use that little bar there with the index so that it's ready to go on both the three on the e and the a so it goes hammer on three on the a five three then in measure eight we're going to strum through all four strings that are already there zero zero three three then we're gonna do five on the a pull off to three so pull offs opposite of hammer ons going to start with the finger on and when you do a pull-off to get a good sound the trick is to not just take the finger off but to physically pluck the string as it goes and that's going to get you the good pull-off sound and immediately after we do that pull-off we're going to cross the ring finger to 5 on the e string and then 3 on the e 3 on the a 3 on the e and open on the a take our hand off so that's probably the hardest part of the song if you're really struggling with it it's okay to just kind of hold the chord the zero zero three three that whole time but if you want to get it sounding you know really nice just practice that riff nice and slow but here we go measures five six seven eight all together should sound something like this goes [Music] that's very slow with it but so you can start to hear it then we go on now to measure nine and measure nine is going to be just two on the g and two on the c so we're going to take our ring and our middle fingers place the middle finger here on two of the g ring here on two of the c strum through the g c and e strings open e again and again and that's close your eyes or close your eyes rather and then go and think and to do that we're going to play open on the e again for the word and and then for think we just add our index finger here to three of the e string and then we switch to our e7 chord index finger on one of the g middle finger here on two of the c and we're going to then play the g c and e string stopping on the a of me then we're going to stream through the full e7 so i have that ring finger on two of the a nice and soft no words there then we're going to play the words and soon i will be there now here's what's cool soon soon i will be there measures 11 and 12 are exactly the same as measures three and four going need a helping hand they are exactly the same so once you have three and four down 11 and 12 are the same so let's go in here 9 10 11 and 12 all together should be something like this close your eyes and think of me and soon i will be there two and then we go on to measure 13 now we're going to be playing brighten up play a d minor chord pretty straightforward we're going to be fretting the d minor the same way we did before middle finger on two of the g ring on two of the c index on one of the e or the other d minor mentioned earlier we're going to play the g c and e strings for bright just the e string for n and then the g c and e for up so it goes brighten up no a string in that whole sequence and then the very last chord all through nice and soft because there's no lyric and then we're going to play this interesting little chord we're going to play two on the c with our middle finger open on the e and the a and we're not going to strum the g string so we're just going to strum two zero zero and that's going to be e and then in add ring finger on three of the e and then open on the e and then two on the c for the notes and the words rather even your dark guest night then from here it's going to do a bunch of filler and for this filler we're going to leave our middle finger where it is here add our index on one of the e string and our ring finger on three of the a strum through all four strings and then we're going to pluck our g c and a strings then we're going to go to a g7 chord which all that we have to do there is take our ring finger slide it down one fret [Music] and then to finish this we're going to play open on the e u and then the word just is one on the e so here's all of measures 13 14 15 and 16 should sound something like this should go brighten up even your darkest night [Music] you just now here we go on to measure 17 which is kind of you know the main melody of the song you just call out my name and you know wherever i am i'll come we're going into the uh running eventually you've got a friend but here on measure 17 to start we're going to play just three on the e string to do this we just take our ring finger place it on the third fret of the e string we're going to strum our g c and e strings the word call and then we're going to play out my now to do this we're going to play open on the e then take your index play one on the e and then pull off to open on the e a little tip it's really hard to do pull offs on fret one it's the hardest place to do hammer ons and pull offs i think is fret one so you want to make sure when you play it to get a good uh pull off you want to actually physically pluck the string as you go through have that finger pluck and then we go on to 18 this is a really pretty little c major seven chord to play this we take our middle finger place it on the fourth fret of the g string and our index place on the third fret of the e and we just don't play the a string and this is basically just an f chord moved up two frets so as far as way to think about playing it it's not that complicated so we have now we've played call out my name then what we do is we just take this f chord shape that i just mentioned it's a c major seven chord but it's an f shape and we slide it down to the f and we play one and three one on the e with the index three with the ring finger and that's and u and we go on to the word no we add that middle finger back on for an f chord and that's the word no and then when we play wherever i am we're going to play one on the a with the index where open a f three on the e with the ring one on the e with the index i and then to go to m we go to a d minor chord same chord we've been playing throughout the song two two one zero middle finger on two of the g ring finger on two of the c index on one of the e and so just to look at that little run here with the words uh name and you know wherever i am it should be something like this name see that's like the f chord shape and then we slide it down and you know wherever i am the last two notes now this are and to play that we're going to play zero two one zero middle finger on two of the c string index on one of the e string open on the a word aisle and then for the word come i'm going to play three on the a string and that finishes that whole stanza so it should sound something like this [Music] and then we go run and we're right into this next section here on measure 21. this is my favorite little part of the song i just love slides they're something that i really enjoy doing in this case we're going to play three on the e we're going to strum our g c and e strings with our thumb and immediately after we play the three on the e we're going to slide it up to five on the e and then we're going to slide it back down to three on the e string a trick to do a really good slide with this is maintain the pressure and actually increase it just a tad as you're doing the slide so you start the slide kind of increase the pressure up to five and increase the pressure just a little bit more back down to three not a lot but just enough to keep that note ringing and that's run uh run in then we're going to play zero on the e twice for oh yeah and then baby is going to be two on the c with our middle finger and then e is going to be open on the c so we have run in oh yeah baby and then we're going to play to see you again pretty straightforward little bar we're going to play open on the c for two open on the e for c one on the e for u and then open on the e for uh and then for again we're just going to take our middle finger place it here on two of the c reflect just our g and our c strings stopping on our e string for the word get so we have again and then from here we're going to do some filler and that filler is going to be played off of this chord here with our middle finger still on 2c add the index on one of the e ring finger goes to 3 on the a we're going to stream through our g then our c then our e then our a then our g then our c nice and softly because there are no lyrics associated with it and then we're going to play a g7 chord just take your ring finger move it down one fret and then open on the g and two on the c all of that is filler so we want to play it nice and soft so let's go in here measure 21 22 23 and 24 should sound something like this [Music] now we go on to the next bar here which is winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call and and to start here we're going to play open on our gc and e strings omitting the a string win and then tur is going to be three on the e string adding our ring finger and we're gonna play that again and we're gonna play it one more time and that's for the words winter spring sum and then we're going to take it off er and put it back on for four but when we put it back on for the word or we want to look ahead to the word fall which you can see is that same little c major seven that four zero three chord we played before it's like an f chord moved up so for the word or we're going to play that three on the e with our index finger so it goes winter spring summer or so you see how i kind of switch fingers there to set up now for the word fall to be right there and then for filler there i'm gonna play open on the c and three on the e and then i move down to our f chord all you got two now this is a little tricky we're gonna play the f chord and then we add the three on the a open on the a again and we have to depart here to do this little embellishment run for the words do is call to play this we're going to start on 7 on the a take your ring finger play it on 7 and we're going to do a pull off down to 5 which our index finger should be on so remember good pull off make sure that you're actually plucking the string to get that sound and then we're going to slide down to three sounds so good such a fun little line i love these type of lines makes it a little challenging though and what you do is when you do the slide increase the pressure a bit slide just to the adjacency of the fret wire you don't want to overshoot it and after you've done that for the do is we're going to go to this really pretty chord ring finger added on the five of the e and middle finger adian for the c notice how our index is still here on three of the a it's an a minor seven chord we're gonna stream through all four strings so just so that you can hear that all you got to do is call it's something like all you've got to do is do is then we got a little filler chord here it's almost the same but we need to be playing three on the e instead of five on the e so what we do is we take our ring finger off and we move our index finger to bar across the three on both the e and the a strings and strum that nice and softly and we're going to play the word and [Music] so that whole part on measure 25 is winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call all oh and and excuse me the word is and at the end there now we move on to the last set of measures here which is going to be i'll be there and to start this line we're going to play the f chord then we're going to go all the way up to 7 on the a we can just use our pinky finger there and then we're going to go back to that chord we just played that little a minor seven so middle finger on four of the c ring finger on five of the e and index here on three of the a strum through all four strings and then we're going to go slide down and move a little bit so our middle finger stays on the c string goes to two index finger comes up to one on the e and the ring finger goes to three on the a for that chord there it's called a g7 sus4 if you're wondering and then we've got the main part we've got you've got and so to play this we're gonna play open on the c and two on the c with the middle finger open on the c again and then we're going to play this little line to end the song take our middle finger place it on four of the c index here on three of the e strum our g c and e strings for the word friend and then there's a little fill at the end to play this fill you're going to take your middle finger slide it up to five on the e or excuse me five on the c you're gonna add your ring finger to five on the e you strum your g c and e strings then you go back to that previous chord so middle finger down to four index here on three of the e slide it down two frets to zero two one add three on the a with the ring and finish it with a c chord so here's all of measure 29 30 and 31 and 32 so you can hear it goes there you've got a friend at the end there it's still phil but you can play the last few notes a little bit louder just because it's the end and there you have it there is the full arrangement of you've got

"ok so here we go [Music] hey what's up everybody this is Tata from 10 thumbs procom coming at you with another lesson today we're doing I'm Yours the easier beginner trimmer version alright so you can go ahead and look for the advanced person on Saturday Saturday and B but if you just got your ukulele let's say it's Christmas time you love this song you want to learn it I'm going to break this down as easy as possibly to playing the song in no time alright 10 thumbs procom check the links below so you can ball to help us grow but if you came just because that you could live these years and you want to break it down that's cool like they get not respected I want you got your ukulele bring attention span following out anything let's click this lesson up right now alright time to break down I'm yours by Jason Mraz now remember this is the beginner easy version we will be dropping the full version in B major this Saturday but this is going to be a simple version for anyone view up that I've got the ukulele and you're just beginning but you really like this song and you want to play along with it we are going to need AC major all right ring finger third fret G major pointer finger second strip second fret g string middle finger third fret E string I'm sorry middle finger second fret a string your ring finger will be the third fret E string a minor middle finger second fret E string and an F major which is going to be the same as our E minor but we're going to put our pointer finger on the first fret of the D string and later we're also going to need something called and B diminished that's a little later okay no the idea is to go from one measure OC to one of G to one add a minor to one of F so if you were to count it would go one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four we need to make it a little groovier than that so we're going to play it like this [Music] all right now make sure at this point you're a true beginner that you're able to join the course and kata for one two three four one two Accenture once you get that down let's break the stroke down what I'm doing is I'm going down up down up down up down down down but you'll notice the second time I go down up the down is a little stronger down up down up down up down up down up down down down and this happens four times over each chord so over only the C would look like this down down up down up down down up down down up down then you switch the Jeep down up down up down down up down up down up down down a minor move down up down down up down down up down down I'm down death [Music] all right so what I'm going to go ahead do is I'm going to put that together and I'm going to play through this loop three times in a row your goal should be to play along with me and try to keep the rhythm the whole time okay so here we go [Music] and believe it or not that is 99.9% of the song there's one other little part that I'm going to show you right now all right so that's it that's the entire rhythm go ahead and put that to the lyrics and you have the song all right now there's one other part that part where goes should be love love love love and what we're doing there is we're going through the loop like normal singing those lyrics we give this part so got the same commands me love the what we're doing here is we're making a core called an e diminished middle finger first fret ring finger middle finger first fret of the C string ring finger first fret of the a string and you're going to let that one just play one two three four then you go right back into the rhythm alright so if you run through that really quick [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right that is I'm Yours give that under your fingers practice it because we're also doing the advanced version in the key of E minor as well all right I'll go ahead if you're beginner really get this one under your fingers so you can play it so you have it down so you feel comfortable with it before you go ahead and alright 10 thumbs procom thumbs up if it helped you and until next time keep playing ukulele keep letting us know what you want to learn and we're going to do our best to help you out all right cheers and take care of yourselves all right I'm yours now you got it I know a lot of you probably bought this you cook your ukulele just to play the song it was so popular super uber mega hit millions and millions of copies sold and now you got it you can play it on ukulele gonna go oh dude I'm yours you know ya know tenth ultra calm that's how I learned it boom check it out and we all win alright okay until next time big thumbs up a big hug from us to you take care and ukulele bless ciao", "00Bp9i7HJzM": "i've had a couple of questions about how to actually apply the wax because some of you are getting breakage and some of you are not being able to get all of the hair it's actually really an easy fix but it's an easy fix that you have to practice with and get used to doing it and then it works really good when you take your stick i'm going to put this on my arm here and i'm not wearing gloves because i'm doing it on myself okay so the pressure uh maybe you can see the pressure you need to get the angle correctly and the pressure see how i'm actually kind of pushing it into my skin where i'm actually bringing it down a little bit you need to use that pressure it's hard to explain it i can't go like this and have you feel it okay you can actually see the pressure and the angle so when you're putting the wax on and we also had a question about oil so it's just one little tiny drop little tiny tiny drop is all you really need um because if you're using too much oil the wax isn't going to stay so when you move your wax again you just bring it back here bring your wax up so i'm going to put i put hard wax on in this manner and i bring it down and see the pressure i'm doing it really slow and a little exaggerated but i'm really getting that pressure on there and one of the questions was my wax keeps coming up do i have on too much oil well if you work your wax too much when it starts to dry that's going to help it happen as well so again this wax is going to dry pretty quickly and then you just take it off okay so let's do that again so we can and you don't have to re i'm not going to have to re-oil myself so i'm going to take the wax you don't want to put it on this way when you're using hard wax because if you put it on sideways like this your wax is going to be too big of a strip and it's going to hurt too much when it comes off so when you're using hard wax let it pool bring it down work it down two or three times and then i'm actually pushing it to the skin and getting it on there so we're going to let this dry a little piece of wax i got it off a little too soon so if you're doing a strip wax okay the pressure is exactly there goes my oil okay the strip is exactly the same you don't need oil but let it pool but this you want to do sideways and i'm actually pushing it down not to the point where it hurts but it actually comes off a little bit thinner that way too so this one here we're going to lift it up we're going to pull it and i talk a lot about i'm going to take this opportunity to be a good salesperson we talk a lot about the wax not being with it being resin and not breaking like the polymer waxes do this wax is going to stay more pliable than anything that has a polymer in it which is the plastic so it'll work with you instead of fight you a little bit so when you get your strip i can get one strap it here again then you just take it off in small pieces if i were to take this whole strip and put it down like this like we were all taught in school and pull it off you're probably not going to have a client that's going to come back because that hurts so when you do your strips see the thickness of my strip i always try to do it about the same as the stick the width of a stick and then it doesn't even hurt so when i get people that say you must have the no screen cream in your wax because your wax doesn't hurt either it's because of the way you take it off okay", "s7gdpJCnQZ4": "[Music] waiting for the calm down walk the streets with me doing decently just let [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah and there's one thing that I need from you can you come [Music]", "zHUGok_U2mE": "hi guys welcome back to my channel with me rhea today i'm going to teach you another bts song butter and play these are the cards that we need to know to play the intro first and a little bit of the chorus feel free to skip ahead if you already know the fingering position to play f chord take our index finger place it on the first fret second string middle finger on the second fret fourth string next we go c tiny finger on the third fret first frame and then e minor seven so middle finger goes to the second fret third string ring finger on the second fret two but on the first string [Music] plus is a minor seven my favorite chord [Music] to sound like the original song we need to put a capo and place it on fret one but in this tutorial i'm not going to use kpop okay chord progression in this song is mostly f c minor seven and a minor seven so make sure we can do it smoothly okay but later in the chorus we have a new chord progression but it's okay we can talk about it later so the song starts with the first in the first we just need to strong once each card let's go [Music] [Music] and in the pre-chorus it's different we need to do one two three four one two three four okay with the lyrics is it true [Music] untrue [Music] now in the chorus the strumming pattern is like this down down up up down down down down up down okay [Music] and then we head to the post chorus this is different so we have two additional cards in the post chorus the first one is g sharp major seven so our middle finger goes to the third fret third string our ring finger just below the middle finger our tiny finger just below the ring finger and then our index finger goes to the first fret fourth string it's quite tricky yeah next card is b flat it's also tricky so close everything on the first fret using our index finger our middle finger goes to the second fret third string and our ring finger on the third fret fourth string yeah it's quite tricky the stronger pattern in the post chorus is the same like the chorus but the chord progression becomes this yeah it's hard but we have no other alternatives so just practice okay especially this to this [Music] oh [Music] in the second first we need to play like how we play the pre-chorus so this one two three four three four okay later in j-hope's part it's a little bit different but it's okay we can just play along directly with the lyrics [Music] is [Music] and then we go to the pre-chorus again so it's the same like the first [Music] pre-chorus so yeah we need to play another chorus after that so i'm just going to head straight to the bridge rms part the chord progression in the bridge is this one the same like the post chorus the tricky one remember i don't like it either but we have to do it so and then there are times when we only need to strum four times each card and then some parts we have to strum eight times so it's okay we can just play along directly after the bridge we're going to head straight to the lost chorus and the post chorus technically all the same so i'm just going to play starting from the bridge until the end of the song okay foreign [Music] is [Music] home [Music] that concludes today's tutorial i hope you have fun playing it and just in case if you haven't been able to play this smoothly yet it's okay it's tricky i get it it's tricky for me too just remember keep on practicing and be patient and we're going to do it in no time okay i believe in y'all so anyway i hope this tutorial can be helpful and i really hope you guys will enjoy this video if you do please support me by giving it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel okay i'm going to be so thankful thank you so much for watching and see you soon", "ser_3Cqg7qY": "[Music] raining [Music] hi guys welcome to yoga guide I hope you all are well now in today's lesson we're covering a song request and this is a very popular one child from the movie love article so I hope you guys must be waiting for this song and if you are then you take out your yolk unit in standard tune and let's start with the lesson so now let's talk about chords and to play this song we'll be needing four chords and these cards are called D minor chord F chord C and chord G so now let's learn how to play these chords to play chord E minor you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 2nd fret 3rd string and called D minor it should sound like this to play chord F you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string in your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F should sound like this to play chord C you need to place your ring finger on 3rd fret first string and Godsey should sound like this you play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret third string your middle finger on 2nd fret 1st string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and Gorji should sound like this so guys now let's discuss humming pattern and in this song we are using a very easy strumming pattern that is down down up down down down up down down down up down down down up down so guys you understood this drumming pattern and now it's time to practice it so I would recommend that you hold all four chords one by one and you start practicing this pattern so start with called E minor and you play this pattern four times for instance [Music] then you move to other chord so-called see [Music] okay then you repeat the same exercise on called J and called F so now let's discuss different sections of this song so this song has two major parts so the first part is verse and in worst part will be using chords in this order so it will start with called E minor then chord C then chord G then called C again and then called E minor okay and you start playing it like this [Music] [Music] okay so what we did here on called D minor and chord C we played this pattern two times each and on chords G chord C we played this pattern once and then we ended on called D minor and we played a single down strokes so the next part of this song would be chorus and to play chorus part will be using chords in this order so called D minor chord C then you again play chord E minor chord C then called F then called C and then you end on called E minor key okay so when you play it it should sound like this [Music] [Music] okay so we did the same logic here we'll start with Coeur D minor and we play our pattern two times okay so then Godsey so two times again on cord see then you have to repeat the same thing so D minor chord C two times each then you play chord F one time then you go to chord C then you play it one time and then you move to called d-minor okay and you play our pattern one time and then you end with a single long stroke so guys again when we'll be playing this song in the song play part I will be giving you all instructions so you can easily relate things and that will again help you to play this song with more confidence now guys to play the song I will be using a capo and placing it on first fret like this now in case you don't have it then you can play the song without capo that's not a mandatory thing but again if you want to play around with your scale you want to sing on a higher scale than me or if you want to adjust your pitch then you should need a capo I think you can easily buy it from Amazon or any other shopping site and that should work for you alright so as we understood everything now it's time for the song play and I wish you good luck and let's get started [Music] ooh [Music] [Music] Hey Johanna [Music] [Music] shy [Music] yeah so guys I'm sure you must have liked this lesson

[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do do you", "GxztNmeNXYU": "uh [Music] oh let's take this overboard [Music] back with another video so today i am coming to you guys with a how to wax so let's get right into this video so today i am going to be giving you guys tricks and tips on how to waste your lady parts in your overall body the right way so today i'm going to try to attempt waxing my lady party and my armpits for you guys so today i will be showing you guys this product that i love to use my sugar wax so this is a natural and organic product you can find this on amazon i think it's about 25 to 29 dollars it's extremely natural it's a sugar and paste organic hair removal for all body parts and it's the ingredients is water citric acid and dizzy you feel me um it's so natural that you can eat it if you want but now when it originally come it comes in this box and when it comes in this box it comes like this and it comes with waxing strips and um like applicator sticks but since today my wax is taking so long to come i am going to demonstrate using my other wax is damn near almost done so that's why i ordered a new one and yet it didn't come but what i did get in the mail was some wax strips and some applicator sticks now it comes with wet strips and applicator sticks like i said but i decided to just order my own because it doesn't come with that much obviously and i just wanted to have a lot so i ordered like about a hundred fifty like a hundred sticks so these are the scripts i ordered remind you it comes with it but i decided to order mine separately so i could have more and then these are the applicators i'm talking about so let's get right into this video so i'm gonna be watching my armpit y'all my armpit need help like face that can y'all see that might so to start off there's only a little bit in here i swear y'all oh anyways to start off you want to put this in the microwave for about 15 seconds no more than 20 seconds because you want that runny consistency and you don't want it to be like watery so i'll put this in the microwave and i'll be right back all right guys i'm back so this is how it looks as you can see it's pretty runny it's a little bit left but oh oh well but it's a little bit left we're going to try to get this done but i'm going to demonstrate to you guys how we do this so you guys want to always make sure when you're waxing anything on your body you want to make sure that you exfoliate the day before you wax i exfoliated yesterday i have i exfoliate that's a part of my routine my shower routine i totally ate my face actually my armpit my lady part my skin um just to keep my skin moisturized smooth you know everything flowing the right way now after it's fully you want to wait a day before you start your wax because you don't want to exfoliate and get waxing and everything at the same time because your lady part is going to get irritated and your results is not going to come out how you want them to come out so i recommend y'all do everything one step at a time actually yesterday um not expecting to wax today but i did it yesterday anyway so you're also gonna need scissors if you want well you're gonna need scissors so okay i have a lot of these and that's good because not only can i use this to wax i could use this to apply my wigs um but i'm giving ways to break this year like something's like but it's good that i have a lot because it's very it's being very sanitized i don't have to use the same one over and over again i can really just yeah i don't have to use the same one over and over again i could really just take my time so this is what we're gonna do i'm used to doing this y'all so this is nothing too crazy to me we're gonna start off by taking a strip oh and there's a lot of strips in here that's good and you have little strips in here too if you want to wipe your eyebrows stuff like that um that's why i ordered my wax strips separate because i wanted to have my own collection or like my own little pack but this is what you're gonna get you're gonna measure so i need the wax to go like this and pull off so i'm gonna cut about here and you're gonna see why because instead of using one whole wax and wasting it you could divide it into two so that's what i'm gonna do now i cut it i have two long enough to just ch so moving on now you're going to take your wax and you want to make sure that it's running you know you don't want to let it cool down too much because it's already hard so this is a really good consistency to wax right now so okay good so once you take the amount of wax that you want you're gonna roll it around like this cool and you wanna put the wax down the direction that your hair is growing so i'm gonna go like this oh that's hot so i'm gonna go like this make sure you have all the hairs all right then i'm going to take my wax strip and i'm going to put it a little a little above the wax and just slap it on there like that stretch you know do your little thing now lot of i get nervous trying to take it like oh you don't want to let it sit too long it's going to really hurt the longer you let this sit on your skin the longer it's going to take to come off or you know the harder it is all right so we're going like this i'm stalling y'all hold on all right so once you do that you want to just yank not much hair though there's not much hair because i usually wax anyway and while i've been watching it's been harder so now once you do that anything that's left you want to go in with this and kind of lift up all the wax that's left now once you're done doing that as you guys can see all of it is not fully gone so we're gonna do that routine one more time just like that [Music] and you just keep you don't want to do it more than like two times i'm not gonna lie three times is in you feel me okay you missed this spot but [Music] after anything after that is pushing it because for real so you just i'm gonna just keep applying a little bit more because i see there's spots that's missing to take my other wax strip i'm going to put it just like that again just like that and then you're gonna this one got a good amount so it's okay to go over it if you missed anything [Music] as you guys could see this looked pretty good yeah this looked about good one armpit down another one to go so next you just do the same routine at this point get you a strip [Music] get your strip cut it in half i know this one hurts tap it on and if you guys want to know how i got my nose to look like this i posted a video yesterday on how i did a diy on some press-on nails go watch that video if you haven't already oh yeah so you want to let this sit for about 10 to 15 seconds press it on make sure the wax is sinking into the strip so i have a better grip [Music] so my armpits aren't really like extremely hairy because i wax often um plus when you wax a lot wait this one pretty took for the first try this one took a good amount but i'm gonna do one more layer but for the um after a while i know a lot of people have the question does it hurt does it hurt this hurt yes it hurt but after a while when you continue to keep waxing often you're going to be immune to the pain i'm not going to say it's not going to hurt because whoever be saying that be lying or it really depends though because people have high tolerance but after a while you do get used to it and it is it's really not going to be as bad as your first wax um i would suggest waxing over shaving i'm doing this i'm i would suggest waxing over shaving um the reason being is because better the wax you get all the hairs out rather than just shaving and you're just shaving the top layer of the hair without taking the hair off the actual skin if you know what i mean um if you want to know if waxing is better i'd advise y'all to do something because what i did to make sure that waxing was would have been a better choice for me growing up is one day i was like you know what let's see what works best i shave one of my lady one side of my lady part and i wax one side of my lady part and as time went by i kind of seen a difference and i seen the part that i shaved was like looking like it was growing when i just like shaved it like two days ago and the part that i watched was just still looking like you know baby smooth and i was like yeah i'm gonna stick to waxing and with waxing you're less prone to getting razor bumps or um yeah razor buffs or things that cause stock marks so that didn't hurt at all because there ain't much hair there so once you do that you fold it and then you use that side to like take off the rest of the glue off your armpit okay that looks about right so that's my armpit y'all it looks really nice though so that's my armpit looks pretty nice pretty nice perfect now when you're waxing before i get down to shape like waxing my lady part when you're waxing your lady part or your armpits or whatever that you're waxing i'd suggest you guys use this so this is i don't know if you guys can see it this is something called pfb my banished pfb chromabite it says it's skin brightening ingrown hair relief waxing slash razor bump for men and women i have another one i have another one on the way because listen y'all my holy grail like this right here will be a trophy to all they are like i promise and it looks like a deodorant and when you finish wax you would wait 24 hours before you apply this and what this does is it keeps your wax smooth without any razor bumps for those that have sensitive skin or like even if for those that you because i know there's some people out there that watch and probably still get razor bumps but this will be your best friend when waxing this will be your best friend because a lot of people are scared to speak on things because growing up i used to be very insecure about how down there was because i used to have razor bumps and i used to be so ashamed and i used to be insecure and i didn't want to have sex or anything like that so i was just you know doing my research and was like man sometimes if you accept the things you can't change but if you can change some things at least you know give it a try um but now i'm very confident about down there i've been taking care of it it's been this is not a overnight process this is months and months and months of treatment that i've been doing waxing and using this and exfoliating it's just you know your hardware does pay off and you will definitely see a difference so don't think that you're the only one out there dealing with razor bumps or dealing with ingrown hair or anything of that sort you know i used to be in that position and now i'm very confident about how down there look i'm confident i love how it looks it's really came a long way i'm telling y'all i used to be down there and like damn what is up with you stuff what's going on you know what i'm saying so this right here you would put after you wax 24 hours after you wax so once you wax you would apply this and you'll let it you just let it dry before you put um your pennies or anything on and you will put this twice a day when you wake up after you take a shower like when you wake up shower put this on and before you go to sleep shower and put this on and do that every day and i promise you if you stay consistent you will definitely see a difference you're going to be grateful you're going to come back to the video and being on comments like damn girl you was alright you were right but so this right here ranges from about i think 30 dollars i'd recommend y'all to get this um this will definitely make a difference when you apply this don't put like i'm telling y'all do not put this right after you wax it's gonna feel like it's burning and you're not gonna like that feeling because you know you just wax you get what i'm saying but put this 24 hours after and when you use this gradually you'll see that your lady part is starting to look like it's drying out and it's going to start looking like you know your skin is peeling and that's a good sign that mean it is removing layers of your skin to get rid to work on getting rid of your ingrown hairs or your scars your dark marks because your scars and dark marks are layers and layers layers layers under your actual skin it's not on your top layer it's layers and layers under your skin so what this do is it sheds layers of your skin to not only make it lighter down there but it also helps get rid of your scars and groans hair it prevents you from getting into girl hair and all of that so i definitely advise you guys to do this you only want to put this you only want to put this on the top [Music] don't put these between on the side of the lips don't put it in there don't put it nothing it only should go on the top i know there's a lot of people that deal with um discoloration hyperpigmentation stuff like that but this i promise you i don't steer y'all wrong ladies i don't steal y'all wrong this is gonna be your best friend when it comes to waxing this is going to be your best friend for your confidence and this is going to be your best friend when it comes to your lady parts so you guys will thank me later i'll leave the description down below um to purchase it on amazon for you guys but this is the best thing that ever happened to me i watched and did my research and did review like i've watched reviews on this and i was like you know let me give it a try i've been using this for about i'd say almost eight nine months now and i've definitely seen a difference um result wise you will see results probably like within the first month you'll definitely see results for others it's quicker maybe i wasn't paying attention too much but i'll say for the first month you'll definitely see me talking within that first month of using this so i would advise y'all to purchase this when doing a rash routine because why not why not wanna um you know some people will be like oh that's how you are you don't have to change nothing if somebody loves you they're gonna appreciate for that well yeah cool i love myself enough to want to help myself and build my own confidence before a man i let a man do that for me so i would just suggest you guys do that now for the fun part let's get down to my lead [Music] so y'all cannot see nothing at all all right so this is what we're gonna do i'm gonna take a strip [Music] cut it this time you don't have to be that long though i'll cut it like one third [Music] definitely and then i'm going to take my wax i exfoliate it down there too so um [Music] is coming on january 21st so i gotta try to see if this would be enough to watch my whole [Music] jj [Music] [Music] [Music] so i know a lot of people are gonna be like how are you able to do this on yourself you just gotta count in your head and get it over at this point now when you wax your lady part when you're pulling off the strip so you put the wax and you pull it off you want to hold your skin for about a couple seconds [Music] because it's going to get that stinky feeling like you know y'all know what i mean for those of you that wax but it's going to give that you know really spicy i can't really describe it all right oh it looks nice though oh on that dot i think oh that looks nice though that one little space that i did look really nice just by feeling that i don't think i'm gonna be able to film this entire video without bugging so i will end the video here because ain't no way anyway oh ain't no way i'm gonna make it through this video filming ain't no way i'm gonna make it through this filming this so in that thought i'll do this off camera but that will be the end of this video guys don't forget to like comment and subscribe until next time", "kBBaSE0NSxk": "[Music] all right so I did a lesson on this song about a year ago on guitar and I just thought it'd be cool to do a ukelele adaption go ahead hit the like and subscribe button so I can keep making these videos for you guys and let's get started so what you want to do is we're gonna start with a G major 7 chord so what you're gonna do and this might be hard for for some people to kind of smash all their fingers in there but you're gonna put your index finger on the 2nd fret of the 3rd string middle finger 2nd fret of the 2nd string and your ring finger 2nd fret of the first string and then what I'm doing is I'm assigning my thumb to the 4th string my index finger to the 3rd string middle finger to the 2nd string and then ring finger to the 1st string so what you're gonna do is pluck first with your thumb and your index finger on the 3rd and 4th string so you're gonna go alright so the chord we're playing should sound like this [Music] if you just strum all the strings so anyway you're going to pluck with your thumb and your index finger on the third and fourth string all right then you're going to use your middle finger and ring finger and pluck the first and second string so you've got then you're gonna pluck with your thumb and your index finger again now when you go back to pluck the first and second string you're gonna pluck and then pull off with your middle finger and your ring finger so here's what we've got [Music] so then after you pull off you're gonna pluck again the first and second string so you've got time now we're gonna slide down to a different chord so your index finger was set down there on the second fret of the third string you're going to move it to the first fret of the third string then you're gonna add your middle finger to the first fret of the first string and your ring finger to the second fret of the second string then you're gonna pluck with your index finger twice so you're plucking that third string note you're holding down and again plucking the first and second string simultaneously so the rhythm for that chord [Music] all right so here's what we've got let's just take a look at it all right then we go back okay now this time we're gonna go like this so we've got so see what I did there is I'm hammering down my middle finger and ring finger onto the first and second string from open so you're open and then hammering down so one more time okay so all together from the top so here's what we got okay now we're gonna play I think this is a B minor chord so instead of using just your index middle ring you're gonna just bar across all three of those so second fret of the 1st 2nd and 3rd string and then you add your ring finger here on 4th fret of the 4th string then we're going to strum so we're gonna go down yeah all right down down so here's what we got one more time from the top we're almost there [Music] all right down up down now we got to play a little riff here so the riff is just gonna be index finger is gonna hammer down onto second fret of the 1st and 2nd string so you pluck and then hammer down on the 2nd fret and then you pluck again and pull off so you've got [Music] so look hammer look pull and then singularly pluck the second string it's singularly pluck the first string all right so that's that's pretty much it the second time through there's a slight variation I'll show you but let's just run let's just run it one more time so we're in the homestretch here so we've got all right that making sense so that's what we got so far now the second time through it's all the same except for when we go to the second chord so the second time through we've got ok so what that is when we get to that second core that's the same you're just plucking with your index finger on the third string then the first and second string simultaneously then you're gonna pluck again the first and second string and then quickly pluck the third string then again the first and second string I hope this is making sense so [Music] one more time all right and you don't have to do that you could just play it the way I did the first time all the way through you could just keep repeating that but let's go ahead so now we're running the second time through the riff which is pretty much the same except for the rhythm on that second chord so second time through the riff so I hope this helps you get a good start on this song go ahead hit the like and subscribe button and I'll see you on the next video you", "ibKF-8l9oHI": "do [Music] do so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Laughter] do [Music] you", "Ky9W3tffVyU": "hey what's up guys welcome to another video today's song is on the circles and it's on the ukulele so let's get started alright so let's make this easy and quick tutorial I'm gonna teach you guys the chords and then to strum patterns so the first chord is gonna be a C major 7 2 E minor 7 F F minor and then a G so we're gonna be using these five chords for the entire song so I'm gonna teach you guys two ways to play this the first way is gonna be easier to understand easier to play and the second way is gonna be kind of closer to what you hear in the song so I'm gonna be using the verse as an example we're gonna be changing each chord on the 1 so 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and using the strum pattern of down up so in the chorus it's gonna be a little different we're not gonna use f minor we're gonna use G instead so that was an easy strum pattern for you to use now if you want to get it to close as possible to the actual strumming we're gonna be using 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & and as you can see the C major 7 chord is on the one and then the E minor 7 is gonna be on the end right after the 4 so and then I'm just gonna use the same thing for the F to the F minor [Music] so together that was song like this and you'll do the same thing for the chorus also using the G so knowing the strum pattern and the changes between the chorus and verse hopefully you guys can use that to play this entire song thanks again guys for watching this video don't forget to subscribe give this video a like

you're super excited to bring it home but when you're at home you want to be able to sit on the couch or a chair like you said with a drink or or something throw your feet up and just close your eyes and listen to the music and you can't really do that come really great with headphones on because you're kind of you're even more stuck to that one spot i mean unless you got i guess portable you know uh wireless ones but but if you have wireless then there's sound degradation in the in in the wireless piece there yeah like it becomes diminishing returns you know the true the true purist analog

covering a song request and today we'll be learning another sensational head from red face or gay I'm sure many of you must be excited to learn this song so with no more ado take out your uke unit in standard tune and let's start the lesson so guys to play this song you need for easy chords and these chords are called C called a minor chord F and chord G so to play Godsey you need to place your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and Godsey should sound like this a play called a minor you need to place your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called a minor should sound like this [Music] to play card f you need to place your index finger on first fret second string and your middle finger on 2nd fret fourth string and god f should sound like this okay kanji you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret third string your middle finger on 2nd fret 1st string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and chord G should sound like this so guys now let's talk about strumming pattern and in this song we're using one common strumming pattern which you will be repeating throughout the song okay down down down down up down down down down up down down down down up down down down down up so guys now let's understand how the sternum pattern would sound when you play it in the song so for that we use one called for now and the chord is called see so hold word see and start playing the pattern don't don't don't don't don't don't don't have gone [Music] all right now once you're done with Godsey you practice this pattern exactly the same way with all other chords okay so called a minor called F and chord G and you have to practice in the same way like we did for chord C so guys now let's understand how you will utilize this pattern to play in various sections of this song so the song is super easy you have to repeat the same thing again and again so we have our chords as called C a minor F and G okay you have to play all these chords one by one okay so first chord C then called a minor [Music] then God F [Music] then chord G okay and when you play together extra sound like this [Music] so there's the song starts with a pretty funky intro melody and that intro melody would look like this so there's to play this intro melody you have to focus on those strings so string 2 and string 3 and you start with fit 7 so you start like this ok so Fred 7 then right then then fret 8 [Music] then you again play fret 7 now you tap string to one foot 5 3 times then you go to a string 3 then you play fret 5 on string 3 then you go back to string two ok so Fred eight seven then you again play fret 8 and then a slide to frettin so 8 and then 10 and then you again play fret 7 and Fred 10 okay so one more time very very slowly [Music] so as to play this song I'm using a capo and placing it on second fret okay so in case you have a capo then you place it on second fret and you start playing the same chords and you also add just melody over the fretboard now in case you do not have a couple then you can also play this song without a capo this is not mandatory however if you want to play around with your scale you want to adjust the song as per your waist range then you can use a capo so now as we understood everything let's start playing the song [Music] under an angel [Music] okay a little ha ha [Music] [Music]", "RV0rXpLAXAE": "[Applause] [Music]

went to Walmart today and I bought this selling hats and wax extra-strength all over body wax kit I've never used this before I always go to wax then just because I'm not good doing by myself and I don't know who I could trust to wax my body for me because people are just too late you know so I have my underarms done the beginning of March and it's been about two months and they need to be done

sure after the legs and then we have this extra strength all over body wax here we go guys this is the stuff this is the product extra strength all over body legs yeah let's just hope this actually does work and that's a miracle for me cos well let's get to it and I get these underarms taking care of shall we okay so here we go here we go this super underarms looks like right now before we get into the whole wax preparation and actually waxing my underarms very nervous right now this is my lovely partner Lori she'll be helping me do my own arms today right here you see her she she's already warmed up the wax and started putting it on my arms again guys this is like our first time doing this uh to one another she's now placing the wax strip over the wax again super nervous how this is gonna work oh and it's kind of hilarious um but it's very nerve-wracking she's just making sure she's getting the wax completely on the paper so she can have a good pull when she pulls the wax off yeah that was a very strong pool you can tell she yanked a lot of hair and look at that Wow yeah that is a lot of hair it's really crazy how it looks on the wax paper it looks very interesting that's just crazy like super SuperDuper crazy not all of it came out but majority of it did so that's really really really good because my goodness it was horrifying and again here's he's just trying to go through and try to see if she can get any excess hair that she left behind yeah and that hurt and the more she kept damping the more I was like hey hey hey that's sensitive that's really sensitive the skin is very sensitive after like the wax pull yeah super sensitive here we go getting ready to do the other arm like this is what we have to resort to guys with this whole quarantine stuff man with salons being closed and whatnot it's crazy it's crazy at least we're learning to do it ourselves you know and not depending on salons and everybody else to all the professional people really to do our stuff for us again not all they came out but most of it did so that's really good man it's just it's so freakin incredible how much and I don't know it's just is this crazy it's just really cool to see like all that hair being pulled off your body I don't know call me weird call me strange but it's just like really interesting to look at it's it's like nasty but like very like I catch you at the same time yeah and that's pieces right there I'm gonna have to go through it with the tweezers and get them off and here she is applying the oil that came with the stuff she put some of the oil on a little bitty wipe and she's just applying that to my underarms underarms they were really sticking together I try to get up and that didn't work um yeah we needed that oil and yeah I could definitely mom arms sorry guys for the excess you know side boob but yeah and this is just a finishing look I need my eyebrows done too okay guys so we're back now um so as you guys have seen my underarms they needed some work alright that it was kinda lay under disgusting in but hey it's dead wet it's over it had to be done um well I do this again I'll use this product again yes I use this product again just because it was my first time using it and it was my partner's first time helping me with this wax and so I'll be doing her next but she she shaves I get irritated when I say I can't shave so I'll probably do different body part of hers maybe her legs something I don't know but yeah thank you guys for watching tell me give me a thumbs up give me thumbs downs and what you think about the product I'm not getting anything out of this but they're doing this for this for the Sally Hansen or anything like that I just want to try out something and it works for me save me $23 plus a tip from going to the salon and having it done professionally this looks pretty good too hey what can I say that only cost me nine dollars or some change from Walmart and I can keep using it of course the time I think I'll take that nine dollars to change thank you guys for watching Justin pepper the next time you", "7R7eeGqd2EY": "hi guys welcome back to my channel\ntoday I'm going\u00a0to teach you one of

ukulele teacher and I'm here to teach you how to play Le'Veon rose by How I Met Your Mother so grab your uke make sure it's in tune and sit back and relax while I teach you how to play How I Met Your Mother the first thing I'm going to do is teach you the intro because there's a couple of chords in that but you'll need all the way through the song now this song is in the key of G and that's a chord that you're gonna need all the way through the song so let me teach it to you now and make sure that you know it Berta Lee put your first finger on the second fret of the third string your second finger on the second fret of the first string and your third finger on the third fret of the second string the chord of G should sound like this the second chord you'll need in the intro is the chord of G major 7 now it's actually only one note different to G but the way I'm going to play it is to bar the top three strings on the second fret so you play it like this the third chord you'll need is the cord of E minor for a minor put your first finger on the second fret of the first string your second finger on the second fret of the second string and your third finger on the third fret of the third string E minor should sound like this the next chord you'll need in the intro is the chord of C six now C six really is the easiest chord of all because for that you just put your fingers nowhere in fact it's all four open strings C six should sound like this and then the final two chords of the verse are D and D seven now for D you put your first second and third fingers on the second fret of the for third and second string like this and to go from D to D seven just add your little finger to the third fret of the first string like this so let's just check we've got a chord for the intro G G major 7 E minor C 6 D and D seven now the great thing about this classic old jazz song is you can play it really really slowly so you can really play whatever strumming pattern you like but I'm going to try and play it similar to how they play on How I Met Your Mother which is a sort of lilting down down up up down like this so let me show you the intro then it's just all the chords that we know I'm going to play them through really slowly G G major 7 E minor and then for C 6 play two down strokes and then one down stroke on the D and one down stroke on the v7 so let me show you that intro again G G major 7 E minor C D D 7 and again the cool thing is you really can play it as slowly as you like so now that you've got the intro sorted the first line of the verse is very very similar to the intro as well it's G G major 7 E minor C 6 and D so let's go through that first line really really slowly then hold me close and hold me fast this magic spell you cast this is lovely on and then 2 down strokes on the C 6 rows and 2 on the D then the second line you stay on the D then go to d7 and then back to D like this when you kiss me heaven sighs hello I closed white eyes I see La Vie on and then 2 down strokes on the G and then 1 on the D and the c6 rose so let's play that second line again when you kiss we have sighs though I close my eyes I see La Vie en Rose and again remember you can play this as slowly as you like then we go onto the third line which is really similar to the intro and the first line it's G G major 7 E minor C like this when you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart a world where roses bloom and you can just play one down stroke on the C if you like now the next bit is where the tune of the song changes a little bit but don't be put off by that because you can still play it really slowly and the strong pattern gets even easier what we're going to do is just play three down strokes on the first two chords and then one down stroke on the next two chords so the four chords you'll need are C 6 g c 6 and d 6 now if you know what c 6 sd-6 is just exactly the same but you bar the second fret so instead of all open strings it's all the strings on the second fret this is d 6 so 3 down strokes on the c6 and the g and when you swing angels sing' throw above and then one down stroke on the c6 and one now stroke on the d6 every day would seem to turn into love songs and then the final line starts like the first two lines with the G and the G major 7 but then it goes to C c6 d and G but again we'll go through this really slowly let me show you if your heart and soul to me and life will always be La 3 on Rose let's do that last line again give your heart and soul to me life will always be la3 on rows so let's put the whole thing together and play it through really really slowly hold you close and hold me fast this magic spell you cast this is the V on Rose when you kiss me heaven sighs and though I close my eyes I see the V on Rose when you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart a world where roses bloom and when you speak angels sing from above everyday words seem to turn into love songs give your heart and soul to me and life will always be La Vie on Rose that's how to play La Vie on Rose from How I Met Your Mother I've been that ukulele teach it if you have any requests for future lessons let me know in the

on\u00a0the second fret first string next we go Dsus4 so index finger on\nthe second fret third string\u00a0\u00a0 ring finger on the third fret second string next\u00a0is Bm7 so we need to use our index\u00a0finger\nclose everything on the second fret like\u00a0this yeah we can actually do it like this just put\u00a0\u00a0 all of our fingers here on the second fret but the\u00a0\noriginal song is actually at capo fret one right so we need to put a capo here if\u00a0\nwe want to play like the original and to make Bm7 in that kind of shape it's\u00a0\nkinda hard it's really awkward you see my tiny finger can't even reach here because of the\u00a0\ncapo here so it's better that we just play Bm7 using our index finger like this\u00a0and if\nwe're not strong enough we can just put our\u00a0 middle finger on top of our index finger like this\u00a0\nyeah I'm not sure if it's allowed but I always do it so\nit helps so like I said just now if we want\u00a0\nto play like the original song we have to put a capo and place it on fret one right but in this\u00a0\ntutorial i'm not going to use capo okay\u00a0 the chord progression in this song is Cmaj7 Dsus4 Bm7 and then back to Cmaj7 so make sure that we can do the chord transition\u00a0smoothly okay now in the intro we're going to\u00a0do some plucking but if we don't want to pluck we\u00a0can actually play it like this one two three four over and over until the end of the\u00a0song yeah so that's the simple version okay but in\u00a0\u00a0 this tutorial I'm going to teach you how to pluck\u00a0\nso we need to pluck in the intro until Jungkook's part okay I'm gonna show you how so our left\u00a0\nfingers will be playing the chords right the first\u00a0\u00a0 chord is Cmaj7 let's play it Cmaj7 okay\nnow for our right fingers we need to put our\u00a0\u00a0 ring finger on the first string middle finger on\u00a0\nthe second string pluck them together okay after\u00a0\u00a0 we pluck these two strings together\nuse our index\u00a0finger pluck the third string so it goes like this okay we need to do it twice so change chord change chord and then strum once okay\none\u00a0more time okay let's do it quicker this time okay now let's start playing from\u00a0\nthe intro until Jungkook's part okay where is my angel\nharuui kkeuteul deuriun someone come and save me please\njichin haruui hansumppun saramdeureun da haengbokanga bwa can you look at me\ncause i am\u00a0blue and grey geoure bichin nunmurui uimineun useume gamchwojin naui saekkkal blue and grey for the rap part we need to do it like this over and

why not people learn easily from youtube than they do from other places so sure the song is really easy it's just four chords and a very easy strumming pattern the first chord is a major then it's a b then it's d major and then d minor [Music] so the first chord a major um i'm going to explain it from this is the first string this is the second the third and the fourth so it's two one zero zero right so the first tab is one the second is two so it's two one zero zero for the first uh [Music] the first scored no cable oh and also i apologize for um buzzing sound i didn't cut my nails so a major and then a b is two one zero two so you add the third finger right here on this [Music] and then d minor d major is 2 2 2 0. right and then the minor is two two one zero [Music] and you basically just switch with these so it's and the strumming pattern that i use is just [Music] that's you do this for the first verse the second verse if you want to do an intro and then before the third verse you strum twice and then stop with your hand so it's and then you go into the strumming so it's like there's a reason the line puts barriers on the tube blind um am i missing something you start on the second chord with um the singing so it's so the first chord is empty and then you start on the second chord and then the fourth chord is uh empty as well and that's basically it it's it's really really a simple song um you can do a cover uh not a cover a solo after the second verse and before the third and that's it thank you for watching", "GEhgkBbwAB8": "hey hi hello if you're new to my channel welcome and if you're not new welcome back glad to see you today i'm going to teach you how to play mr lover man by ricky montgomery it is a song that i discovered recently on you guessed it tick tock this song is going to be one of the easiest songs i've ever taught for the ukulele so that's the good news the bad news is i'm new to this song so this might be rough we'll see okay first off strumming pattern there's exactly one for the whole song unless otherwise stated which will happen rarely so it goes down up down up down up down up down down down down the only thing that's difficult complicated about this is it can be a little hard to keep a steady tempo when you have those like because if for whatever reason you're having trouble with the with the up thing up strum if you're having trouble with the up strum um it can slow down your tempo a little bit it took me several takes of my cover to have anything remotely approaching a steady tempo so that is a little bit difficult but the actual motion of like down down down down down isn't too difficult um just maybe practice that before you go into the song alright now we're gonna do chords the verse and the chorus have the same chords which is awesome starting at the beginning it goes f c c maj c g that is like three quarters of this entire song so i'm going to sing it through the verse one thing i wanna know which is just a little strumming thing um is at the end of pretty much every stanza in the lyrics um we're not gonna complete the we're instead gonna go i'm gonna play that for you real quick so you know what i'm talking about it's just because it's how ricky montgomery plays it on his guitar so um going from the second half of whatever that stanza is it's the f [Music] and that's going into the next verse pay attention to when i play that when i play through this verse and play along if you want if you feel ready if you don't feel ready you can go back to the top of this tutorial here i'll be waiting for you you ready okay i'm headed straight for the and it's heading straight for my skin and leaving me tapped [Music] shaking these thoughts from my head [Music] you put these waves in the door my mom is calling me hi mom going from i've got the shake of my legs sorry i've got this shake in my legs shaking these knots from my head you put these waves in the door i'm cracking out i [Music] [Music] these chords are exactly the same going into the chorus uh strumming is exactly the same i just realized i totally watched the melody of the first verse sorry i said i was new to this song but i played the ukulele part writing that is what matters okay going into the chorus i'm [Music] and i miss my lover and this is the one part where you don't go you're actually going to continue that strumming pattern into the third first whatever the verse after the first chorus is so the end of that goes i'm mr lover man and i miss my lover going into the second verse same strumming pattern same chords they're up here if i'm moving too fast i totally understand here's back to the beginning of the song if you need more practice go back here as many times as you need to it's totally okay i will be the wiser all right going into that verse the way in which you talk to me as me wishing i were gone [Music] but you're cracking up you're cracking up [Music] bye mister i just played a whole lot so i'm gonna take a brief break you may notice um there are sort of two sections to that verse that are distinctly different but i didn't do that in between them because that's going from i've got me running on and on oh i'm cramping and there's something about not having the silence for oh i'm cramping up that is kind of nice going into the second chorus which is the same the same as the first one um from the end of that third fourth first i don't even know at this point but you're [Music] cracking [Music] man and the way that we end this first chorus i don't know what i'm saying is we instead of doing because i've been i've been strumming with my fingernails we're gonna go to the inside of your thumb and go [Music] because the bridge is fairly quiet and subdued so the way that that sounds is [Music] like and it makes it muted and pretty and soft okay if you need clarification on any of that because the bridge chords are a little different this is definitely its own distinct section here is back to the top of the song again i will be giving you this several times um so that you can go over that but those are all the same chords through there so bridge time the first part of the bridge goes d minor g c e minor a minor i know i went through that really quickly i'm gonna break it down so the line i'm shattered now is a d minor i'm shattered and then i'm spilling out is a g i'm spilling out next line is upon this linoleum ground upon this is a c upon this e minor nullium and then ground is an a minor depending on how fast you're going that may be a sort of difficult switch from the c e minor to the a minor um just take some practice that whole part song through goes i'm shattered now i'm still [Music] the next line exactly the same chords and strumming wise um so it goes i'm really in my brain again before it can get back to you and then the last line of the bridge which is oh what am i supposed to do without you is a d minor and then an f minor that's a new chord take note of that and then c that line sun sounds like oh what am i supposed to do without you all right from here on out it's all stuff you know because we're just playing the chorus twice again we're just gonna do some stylistic things so i will walk you through that so that last line oh what am i supposed to do without you we're gonna do something similar um as when we went into the bridge which is we're gonna get quieter because if you know anything about the end of this song it's like the it's like the 15 seconds that's always chosen for the tick tock it like starts out quiet and gets loud so we're gonna go 0-1 mi supposed to do without you going into that c major seventh i'm mr loverman and then we get loud [Music] you may notice what i did there was the down down down down strumming pattern i just like that because it gives that transition a little more power so [Music] yeah that's the only thing that's remotely complicated about about this lost chorus so i'm gonna sing through it just so you know it repeats um so be prepared for that play along if you want and uh yeah here we go someone's cutting grass outside i'm so sorry [Music] and i miss my lover i'm mr loverman and i miss my lover [Music] i forgot to sing that line the line goes mr lover man [Music] cool you just learned the whole thing that's all i have for you today if you have any comments or questions or concerns or anything of that ilk um stick them below in the comments i'll read them and respond if i see them um if you enjoyed the video please like and subscribe press that

what's up guys this is Curtis I'm five here with the unboxing and review of Nair spa clay roll on wax this is the Brazilian type so you can use it in those more sensitive areas if you so choose the reason why I got this you know I already have a full-on brazilian waxing kit he's because I am on a travel and I couldn't possibly want to bring that huge pink wax and get it all over my lucky stuff so I bought Swan but it's shipped to me here it is as you can see some waxes re on here that's because I have already opened up and you say not to say this product is quite amazing but just for the first half of this video just show you the packaging so you guys know exactly what you're gonna get when you purchase this product for about ten dollars currently on Amazon alright so these do come in several different scents I do particularly like this one I might try out other ones when this one runs up but anyways it's a friend this is the back here yeah I am happy to say that the instructions are very very clear you can't go wrong with these very articulate well written so that's pretty much if I packaging let me just go ahead and open this up so it does give you quite a few actual cloth strips that are actually reusable so since the wax is actually on while you water soluble sorry so you can actually rinse off the wax after you are done using it and reuse and try these cloths to be used again so that's really handy so you probably don't ever have to get and buy anymore cloth strips unless you you know make holes in the wall somehow here's the instruction manual itself unfortunately it did get wet so that's why that's there and here is the actual wax roller here it is it's really smaller this one is a 5.7 ounce size so here's a roller itself there's actually a safety compartment I'll show you quickly that you definitely want don't throw this out you need this because it prevents the wax from reaching the roller when you are not using it so definitely don't throw that away when you're using your net also it's very clear in the instruction so that's it for the embossing portion of this video let's go ahead and talk about the review first let me show you how it's done I like to pick out a clean area and lay out paper towel so it's easier to clean afterwards and then I would take the wax roller here unscrew the top and then you see there is a little seal that you want to remove before you microwave it that way the wax can actually reach the roller make sure to put the co in a safe location so you can use it again later and then just simply screw back on the roller cap and it clicks in really nicely in place really seamless and in the microwave if you want to set the timer for 15 seconds if it's a full bottle ten seconds if it's about a half bottle once the time is up you want to check that there are no bubbles seen and he should just feel very slightly warm since this is a soft wax it does not need to be heated up very much not like hard wax and now you can begin waxing so you want to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth and then you just want to apply race-tin layer and then a play quickly the cloth strip Pat it down rub it in and then pull it in the opposite direction of hair growth to remove the hair it's normal for you to not get all the hair at the first time so you just need to do it several more times until the Aereo trace is pretty much hair free and once you're done cleaning up is pretty much a breeze since this is soft wax in combination with the roller there's really little messes to clean up yours near wash off the leftover wax on your arms and in the residual waxing hair that is found on the wax strips so you can just rinse out all of this under some warm water and you also definitely want to rinse out the roller cap as well as the stopper to make sure that it no residual wax will come out when you don't want it to as you can see when I didn't clean it out very well the first time made it ended up being in the bag afterwards now all that stuff to do is to lay out your classrooms for them to dry one very important tip is when not in use make sure to put back the stopper and make sure to have the container always in this up position so that you don't want any of the wax to accidentally spill out as I did accidentally one time on this chair so hopefully using this quite a few times I have to say I'm very satisfied with this product at ten dollars is a great value especially with your on-the-go traveling in comparison to hard wax which I had previously used before using this this is much easier to apply use and much quicker to clean up in the whole process is only took me about twenty minutes maximum to wax both of my legs as well as my pits in the effect so pretty much just as good as the hard wax though I do want to point out that this could be more painful than hard wax especially in more sensitive areas of your skin is not taunt like on your arms or your legs but that is more towards just soft wax in general and not particularly this product I think an arrow did a really good job implementing this role on wax design it has a nice ergonomic shape and the pricing is not too far off the only suggestion I would have from there is to implement a more user-friendly stopper or something that wouldn't be easily lost both ways I would totally recommend this to a friend but they'll do it for this unboxing and review of this product I hope you found it hopefully as usual if you did please consider subscribing to my channel scuffles 95 give it a like to help support the channel and thank you for watching you", "Ja92Sel4-wk": "all right so is it sending that way yeah and then so we're working on this section right now correct okay grab as much as you can okay [Music]

hear and I can feel the resistance a little bit more yeah seiniger head a media yeah so that mean you're not pulling it high enough okay now fold is just because there isn't much left so go ahead and fold it because it's really thick now [Music] okay so then continue using it just like yeah there you go yeah how you want will dictate how the hand will grow okay when people come in to me if if someone else broke the hand I can tell this is shaving you see hair sticking up huh if you don't of like not sort of straight yes if you wax right right everything good everything goes just should be smooth and every single strand of the hair should not be wavy it should lay flat interesting okay yeah you be able to-- that's what i see what hard wax but i think is because they break the hair instead of pulling it off you know like if people get come on baby like a regular hard whacks upon my hard wax yeah it just that i think is the way they do it is they a lot of time people have grown like this right yes so then we'll just apply straight down and then pull up you break the ham i can guarantee you one hum per side okay all right I know you do this it's we're doing just the cleanup go ahead and get a new strip yes since you're then used on the thumb of the pie away just to avoid accident harder use your body weight do use your palm or your fingers when you do it your palm did you lower the bed as well up to you just like how you know massage therapist they don't really use that arms and shoulder it's their body weight really okay you can't go through the day using I just wondered how they don't just like arms because I mean I can't actually having to do that all day so remember here yes you made this thick so you're gonna dip wax like this right you're not gonna apply like this you're gonna apply like this you see the difference not this okay why dripping soldier oh yeah so you apply like this okay new stick prepared sure you didn't scrape it enough okay yeah straight down straight down the food yes never start a new line you just always try to finish the rest okay I think yeah but now you got a lot of wax on both sides you can sprays yeah you don't want to scrape too much because sometimes it pulls on the skin when you scrape it you know all right let's go ahead and yeah now there isn't much left so do a small line from here", "HzPZHpdLwtA": "what is

the ukulele tutorial please do grab your ukulele and please tune into the standard tuning that's your c e and a [Music] so let's start with the chord that's leo so let's that's the layout again so let's start from the basic which is the chord and then for the song we're gonna learn just four chords okay so first is the chord p all you need to do is to place your index finger or any of your finger on the second third frets first string and it should sound like this [Music] that's the chord of c next is a minor it's another single string board and you need to place any of your finger on the second fret fourth string just like this and this is how it should sound like okay now next is the d minor all you need to do is to place your index finger on the first fret second string middle finger on the second fret's fourth string and ring finger on the second fret third string making it sound like this [Music] that's d minor and the last chord is the chord all you need to do is to place your index finger on the second fret's third string middle finger on the second fret first string and ring finger on the third fret second string making it sound like this and that's the chord progression as well starts with c and a and g [Music] see now that we are already done with the chords and let's move on to the strumming pattern so destroying pattern um i'm going to divide it into two so one is going to be like a very beginner and chill kind of way the other one we're gonna use some tabs and we're gonna use some choking and everything so let's start with the basic first with the easiest one okay so if you're um like super beginner and you don't wanna stress yourself in a strumming then you can have this trimming pattern down down up up down up down okay again down down up up down up down and it should sound like this so that's it and you can use that kind of shrimp pattern from the start from the very beginning of the song until the song fades away now we're done with the easiest strumming pattern so let's move back to the easy one well i'm not sure if there's a difference with that word but anyway so this is going to be the strumming pattern so that's down chalk or hold down um hold down down hold down up pull down down hold down hold down down hold and down [Music] okay i don't want to sound cute now anyway so that's it so that will be this another kind of strumming pattern that you can use for this song and let's have the tabs okay so for the intro of the song was like which is really cute so so let's start basically for the tabs guys what's good about that it's going to be a very easy tab we're just going to use the a string or the first string all throughout this tabs okay so we're gonna snug the three other strings so let's start three and then five and then move back to three and then three two three two zero two three five five eight seven three two so that's it i'm gonna paste it here and it should sound like this [Applause] [Music] okay i'm not really good about this kind of thing but yeah that should be it so you can use this tab from the intro or the instrumental part of the song that's it so i think you're already ready so let's go ahead and sing the song together i'm gonna play some lyrics in the chords on the screen so you can sing with me and it's also on the description box below so you don't need to worry much [Music] can you call me baby [Music] i'll be there [Music] i knew [Music] downwards [Music] you stay forever [Music] i'll be [Music] i need somebody [Music] girl i swear [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music]

japanese word which means winter talk maybe so let's get started okay so first thing that you need to know is the chords so the chords for this song is kind of many but you'll really get used to it soon so you need 10 chords in order to play this song versus b flat [Music] and then next to c next is a d minor f g g minor a minor e flat nine eb9 so i realized palad that i should tell the strumming pattern along with the intro the the chorus the verse and then the bridge so first is the inter part so the intro part you need nine chords and the chords are b flat c a d minor g g minor a minor e flat nine and then c um so for the strumming pattern in the intro let's focus on the b flat in the b flat you need down up then switch chord which is c down down up up down up then switch [Music] chord [Music] then one more time okay [Music] up [Music] and next we're going to the verse so the first part they have 11 chords so you have f a d minor a minor [Music] so for the strumming pattern let's focus first on f a and d minor for the f you need four down strums so one two four and then a three downs and then chalk and then d minor down [Music] and then for a minor you know it doesn't matter what strum you wanted to do it with this part so for me okay [Music] so the strumming pattern for your next chords it's like [Music] that [Music] um [Music] so we are down to the first one now we're going to the chorus part and the chorus part needs 11 chords yeah so b flat a minor d minor g minor c f and then b flat again a minor a7 which i forgot to mention [Music] earlier and then d minor g minor c m so the strumming pattern for this one is actually the same in the verse one it's down down up up down up yeah and then switch chord down down up up down up you know tinkerers right play true [Music] okay [Music] so is so now let's go down to the bridge part for the rich part you need at around eight to nine chords i mean seven chords only we need b flat [Music] and then for the strumming pattern for this one is actually just down strokes you know it doesn't matter it's okay if it's one two you know to feel if you wanted to feel the part this part because it's like kind of sad [Music] foreign [Music] so i almost forgot after the course after the chorus number two there is like on that part where you need six chords and then the strumming pattern is just the same down down up up down up so you need a flat a minority minor g minor c f so and then of course part which is just the same and we're finished yes and see you again next time goodbye", "TxTYcHHpQQo": "folks guess what we're doing today we are going to learn how to play Havana by coming Kamilah caballo caballo caballo come I li kamul oh all right step one get your ukulele you all have it make sure that your ukulele is ready to go make sure it is also tuned so if you go sweet little and yeah tune or like I do you can use it it's flat there alright then once this is tuned turn your tuner off and there we go by the way um this isn't any I ukulele I can put a link in the description down below where you can purchase your own the one I got comes with this tuner which is really handy it comes with this strap it also comes with a pick a finger shaker a wipey cloth a capo a lot of other things and it also comes with a case I did a review video it goes a little more in-depth I'm like the features that this ukulele has and everything I can put that in description down below as well and you can buy this ukulele and all of the goodies and all that on Amazon and it comes all the way from China so are you ready folks let's do it this song is very simple it's the same three chords over and over so this should be very easy especially if you're beginner for ukulele the first chord is going to be AG minor and it looks like this you got this this and this okay so I put my ring finger here middle finger here on the second fret and then first finger over here now does the g minor chord folks that's your first chord second chord is gonna be C minor which is really easy I just take my whole finger and I put it on those first three strings on that third fret and C minor and then we have a D which is the first three sorry you can't see this top three strings on the second fret that's a deep okay so we got G minor C minor and D and sometimes a d7 which is just a D and the little pinky on the third fret so here's the strumming pattern so it's it's kind of what I do you can do a little Chuck in between I love Chuck's either the best so Chuck and what a truck is is really it's just you just kind of stop the strings like with your palm I know it looks like my like nails early but my nails aren't even really touching the strings I just like curled down cuz like they're like so you mute it with your palm so that's a Chuck anyway that's the strumming pattern and then sometimes in my video my Havana video which I'll put in this description also sometimes I do a little plucky thing and so I'll do this and what that is is it's just so this one that's all it is and your fingers are just staying in the same chord pattern that they already were in but I'm just plucking little to add a little pizzazz so it's this one okay so the g7 chord [Music] good so once you have that plucking part down that's the my entire song that's the whole song now sometimes you don't have to do this but at the pre-chorus when it's instead of going up to that C minor for that second chord you're gonna go to e-flat if you want both of them will work but e flat is like e if you know what that is in the second fret and it's just moving down the front so it's gonna be these three strings all with these fingers and then this pointer finger is gonna come up here so and then you would just go back to the G minor you can watch my Havana video which is that two million views right now holy crap thank you very much side note seriously guys I did not expect that video to explode that much my Spanish students just requested the song and then I did it and I didn't know it was gonna get that popular so thank you so much also other side note this song was featured in who sang it better this is a YouTube channel they picked me like my cover to represent the USA and what this channel does is it takes covers of pop songs so this one specifically is for Havana and they took it from a cover from someone in Indonesia Germany Republic of Korea France I think yeah and all that so mine represented USA I'll put that in the description too crazy I didn't know that happened but yeah anyway let's go through [Music] he took the back half of my heart is in my heart isn't moving no mana you can walk over there how you doing Santa girls I so it's literally just three minor C minor d7

different ways we can strum it and the progression and we'll do a little play along at the end because this will be addressing a few different levels and I don't know what level you are feel free to use timestamps which I provided in the description if you want to skip around you already know for example how to play the C chord let's get started first thing we're gonna do is we are going to talk about how to play these chords and we're gonna give you a couple of small exercises that you can use to transition going from one chord to another we're gonna start with AC chord since we are in the key of C and to play a C chord we use our third finger on the third fret and we're gonna press straight down on the a string that turns the a note into a C in my version of you are my sunshine I go from C to C seven F the C seven is a passing chord it leads you into the F chord so that's why I do that if you are not ready to do that if you want to just use C and F you can do that too but what I do is I go C and then I use my first finger first fret on that same string C seven so let's just try that once or twice we're gonna go [Music] pause the video and do that on your own if you want to or need to changing to C seven is actually a nice transition because your first finger is already where it needs to be for F what it's going to do is it's gonna skip down from the eighth string to the E string and press down just on the E string and your second finger is going to reach over on the g string and turn that note into an A [Music] that's f-word you want to make sure that it rings and hear every note we're gonna do a little bit of practice transitioning from F to c7 just to get that kind of emotion under your fingers so practice that on your own if you need to after you play the F in this song you go back to the C chord so we're gonna just go and with just those three chords we can't get into most of the song so let's get started the chord progression actually starts on the word Sun and the you are my as a pick up so we'll go one two three four one you make me cars are C [Music] and now we have g7 so what we're gonna do between between C and D 7 is we are going to slide our third finger down to that second fret we're gonna add second finger skipping this string pressing down on the C string we are going to a first finger in between like a little triangle the first fret g7 we're gonna practice transitioning out just a couple times nice and slow from C g7 c g7 c g7 C now we're just gonna do soft down strums I use my thumb to make the sound get that nice soft sound so we'll do one strum for every beat going down so on C and one two three four go you are my [Music] please [Music] now once you feel really comfortable with changing the chords on time let's do a little bit of strumming on this I see doo doo buh doo doo buh doo kinda rift and we're gonna go down down up down down up down down up down what I do is I use my right hand I use the motion falling down usually it's my nails that make the sound don't worry about it if it's not as long as it's going on time now we're gonna just try it with that pattern noticing this twice I will do melody with you first and then I'll harmonize and you can try to just hold your own on the melody I believe in you there we go and 1 2 3 4 [Music] take my sunshine [Music] I hope you found this tutorial helpful at

my experiences home waxing now ever since um I've been kind of in high school I've gone and gotten like wax like guinea wax underarms everything eyebrow wax you know and it costs a lot of money over time and so I finally just said you want I can do this it's not that hard and it's really really not um there's just a few things that you need to know and there's a few things that you need to get and it's really inexpensive and it's a great investment when you consider the fact that every time you got like an eyebrow wax like twenty dollars every time you get you know bikini wax it's like anywhere from forty to sixty dollars or something like that so if you everything that you need to wax for a long time is definitely worth or definitely cost less than one time of getting waxed like a bikini wax or a leg wax or anything like that so what you're going to need is a now I have these together and but you're going to need a wax heater this thing and this is from Gigi this company and it was probably about twenty dollars not very expensive and you're also going to need a wax canister and I have mine in here and um my favorite kind of wax is this honey wax that you see like that and it's kind of a clear honey color and there's a lot of different options out there you can get a low ones whatever I just find that one works perfect for every single body part um you can use it from your eyebrows to bikini to your legs to anything and it's really really versatile and other ones are kind of better for different areas and I just like to use that one there are also boxes called hard waxes and those are you don't need any waxing strips or anything to take off so that's another option but those are really better for smaller areas like your eyebrows or your bikini or something like that they don't really work well for like your legs so I just like to use the honey wax the wax canister probably cost about $8 so 20 for the heater and eight and they have like variable setting heaters but I've had this one that's just like the one on and off switch for a long time and it works great and I don't really find that there's a problem with it and then you're also going to want these rings so I don't know what this company is some company and these were like 289 3 bucks at Sally's yeah and also I got all of my waxing stuff at Sally's Beauty Supplies so any beauty supply store you can also order these online Sally's is a website but these um are really important to protecting your actual waxing machine and they kind of sit around face of the wax thing now if you already have one in and it's really hard to get once these are in here they kind of tend to get wax in between stick the way to get them out once you're done with one is you turn it on you heat it and let that wax melt and then you pull it out like that but in the middle you can just take one of these and rip it somewhere like that and then just fit it around sorry you just fit it around like that and it will just help protect um any sort of wax that drips off or anything like that so you're all set and the other things you're going to need when you're waxing on baby powder really really important anything you're in a baby or sorry anything you're gonna wax you want to put baby powder on first with the exception of any like facial waxing like you do your liver your brow or anything like that I wouldn't put baby powder first you don't need to actually the oils will on your face are just fine but on anything on your body you want to do this so it walks doesn't stick to your skin it kind of absorbs the moisture so it can kind of grab onto the hair better so I definitely recommend using baby powder first um you just put that on first and then you can put the wax straight on I like for body waxing these big um sticks these you get through the packs from Sally and Sally's again or any beauty supply store near where you are and they're pretty inexpensive and even cheaper alternative or like craft popsicle sticks which work just fine - they're a little bit better for smaller areas and if you're gonna do your legs or something this kind of gets the job done faster but popsicle sticks work great - if you're going to be using the wax on anybody else you should never double dip um you know yeah if you're gonna share your wax you should never doubled it if you're the only person that's ever going to use your wax you can double dip with the same stick in the wax be really careful when you go to salons because a lot of times they will double dip and that's really unhygenic and it is basically breeding grounds for bacteria they should only use each stick one time if it touches your body they need a new stick so be on the lookout for that and I've actually had to like walk out of a couple places because they were doing that and I was like I'm not gonna get a wax for me that's not hygienic that's not how you know they're taught at cosmetology school or anything that's really bad form so if you're anywhere and they're doing that that's a good way to get tons of different you know skin bacterias viruses things like that you don't want you don't want to do that um the other thing you're going to need are strips I prefer to buy the cloth strips in rolls now this is probably about twice the size when I got it I mean I've used it for a long time it's the most cost effective way of getting it these probably cost about $12 for the roll of cloth I think the cloth ones are the best you can get and you can get like paper ones and stuff like that but I really really like the cloth ones I think they work great and you can cut them to whatever size that you want so instead of pre sized strips you know you end up it you end up using a lot less I think because usually when you get the big long strips you're not always using big long strips and even if you cut those they get awkward sizes and whatever but these you just cut off whatever you need and they're perfect for like eyebrows or anything like that and I really really really recommend just getting the roll it's much more cost effective and then you need to think about after you wax so I really prefer using like a body scrub like this one is my favorite it's from lashus and it's a brown sugar souffle do not use a sea salt scrub like a salt scrub that will that's a really really terrible idea but basically you want to use something oil-based to get any extra wax off and the scrub part of I wouldn't really scrub it very hard I just kind of layer it over the skin and then put water on it and then the oils will stay and the salts or whatever scrubbing an agent is in there will leave so you can all just use any sort of body oil or anything like that but oil is pretty much the only thing that will get wax off I just really like the stuff because I use this anyways in the shower like all my legs and stuff so um I already have it in there that's why I use it there are also things you can buy like these Mads soothing and finishing wipes which are really great also they're basically just wipes that contain oil so you just use those afterwards and they get wax off and after waxing you don't want to jump right in the water like right in shower or anything like that you really just want to get oil off and if you have to use water just to remove like salt like the sugar in this that's okay but you don't want to like be really cleansing the area because it is a really fresh open wound and that can really irritate it and make it red and it could hurt it a little bit because you want to give your skin time to kind of recover it and the only thing you should really put on there are like natural essential oils and stuff like that so they do make ones that are specifically for waxing that you can get right next to everything else I'm showing you here at your beauty supply store you know pre pre waxing oils or whatever so you can grab those too whatever works best for you but this is just what I use and I'm used to UM another thing about waxing this is just another tip um when you put the wax on you want to wait a couple seconds but not too long you want to wait until it gets tacky before you pull it off but you don't wanna wait until it gets hard so don't just immediately pull it off but don't wait too long you want to you want to kind of feel out the consistency and the longer you do it the easier it will be to UM to know when it's the right time to pull it and another thing too is do not ever move your body part whatever it may be leg anything while you're pulling it so this can be kind of hard if you're waxing yourself and this again takes practice I've been doing this for a long time so I'm kind of used to it to like calming myself down but it is kind of difficult when it's your first time so if it is your first time you know just do small sections don't get overly ambitious and expect to do like your whole body and maybe practice on your legs or something that you think is easier for to do because if you move that's how you get bruising and ripped skin and everything like that that you don't want but honestly this is a great great way to save a lot of money and I'm sorry this video is kind of long and rambling I just wanted to cover everything and I'll put links in the sidebar to Sally's website where you can get a lot of waxing stuff and I'll show you guys my favorite products and stuff like that but I just wanted to kind of open you guys up to this idea because a lot of people I know a lot of my friends have never even considered doing waxing on themselves and it honestly is a great great way of saving money you'll save so much money a year if you're somebody who is used to going getting waxed um yeah so if you guys have any other questions or comments I can always answer them if you leave them below and hope this was helpful for some of you guys and thanks so much for watching and I'll talk to y'all soon bye", "WCZ0iWXb2sI": "welcome to JB lessons I'm JB and in today's lesson I'm going to be showing you how to play a Hedwig's theme or the main theme to Harry Potter on the ukulele [Music] before we start the lesson a few things I need you to do click the description box below to download the music for today's lesson if you're not sure to read tab have a look at this lesson and also if you're enjoying the content that I'm making please do consider subscribing okay to play Hedwig's theme most of the song is actually just on two strings that each string and the a string we sometimes venture to the C string as well but mainly just E and a it's gonna start with two open strings each string first then a string this song is in 3/4 which means it's got a waltz feel to it 1 2 3 1 2 3 and the first beat comes in first a note comes in on beat 3 of the bus it goes 1 2 3 that's where we're gonna start so open string open string stay on the a320 now go up to fret 7 5 and then slide down to fret 2 so I would do the 7 with finger three the five with finger one and then just keep it sliding to open string three two prep for on the e-string this time I would use finger three for this one fret one on the a string then an open E string then it's very similar to the beginning open E string open a string stand the a string 3 to 0 this time we're gonna go up to fret 7 but I want to use finger 1 this time instead of 3 so we use finger 1 which if you've got the dot same as meets the second dot quick way to find 7 7 then use your little finger on fret 10 which will be your third dot and we go 10 just walk your fingers down 9 8 now we've got finger 1 free so that we can grab for and use your little finger again to go back up to eight and keep that run going down eight seven six so we run over that bit again open string open string three two zero finger one on fret 7 little finger on 10 walk it down to notes 9 8 finger one fret 4 then jump back up to 8 with your little finger and walk it down to more notes 7 6 this is when we need that C string we do 3 on the C string throw in the a string then an open a string next we've got alternating from the E string to the a string we want fret 8 on the E string fret 7 on the a string and we're gonna go 8 7 8 7 8 and now with this second finger just rock it so that you can cover that 8 on the a string so we've got this 8 7 8 7 8 Rock that finger 8 keep it going down 7 6 back to the e-string seven eight back to the a-string seven six three undersea string again three open E string seven on the a string then a very similar little thing we go to that eight and seven again eight on the e seven on the eight eight seven eight seven but this time we're gonna go eight ten with your little finger on the a string and it's just

lesson I would like to thank you all for supporting nuki guide as you know that I recently started this channel and we are now a family of thousand subscribers really helping you out so once again thank you for your support now let's talk about what we have in today's lesson today's lesson is a song request you must have seen one of my other lesson 10 hindi songs where I've taught you 10 amazing in the hits now one of those songs was look at shippi and there was a common request by many of you to bring a detailed lesson on it so here I am today I'm giving you a detailed lesson on Luca cheapy so take out your yucks [Music] and let's start learning look at your base so guys let's talk about what all chords we need in this song now to play this song you need three chords and these cards are called C called F and chord G now these chords are fairly simple if you want to play called C you just need to put your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and called C will sound like this to play chord F you just need to play your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and a middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F this sounds like this to play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret 3rd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and god G will sound like this [Music] now once you know these cards now our next plan is to understand the strumming now strumming is the main key of this song so let's learn the strumming so guys the common strumming pattern what we are using in this song is [Music] now let me break this pattern for you so that you can understand it in much better way I'm trying to keep it as simple as I can so that even if you're a beginner you can understand it clearly now whenever you are playing Godsey and chord G you have to make sure that you'll play this particular part of this pattern that is down down now whenever you'll play called F then you'll play the same pattern but you just need to add a Down stroke after this pattern so down up down down so as you can see when you're playing chord F you're using additional down stroke now this down stroke will be played with a stronger force than the other three strokes of this pattern now you will be repeating this pattern all over the song and you have to be extra careful while switching the chords because this song is pretty quick and you have to change chords pretty rapidly so be extra careful while switching the chords so guys I will be using a capo in this song and placing it on second fret like this now if you do not have a capo then you can play all these chords normally and I am just using this capital scale of my voice so let's start playing the song [Music] look I can't be bought [Music] dr. J okay help pity I just saw injury majide' difficult on the log I make me neither I just saw [Music] ow [Music] yahooo Dinkelman [Music] come on Vinick is so Jessica so Lorne or Johanna herself know

"all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 I don't know what that was this is a medical marijuana review for those over the eighteen and medical patients all right guys you know the deal if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up like say hi to everybody out there all right we got where do we go so Tara soft wax Mike have native to review we also got a flower haul from true leave we'll do that at the end and there's a new product coming out and some new I guess you say prices on some flowers in other places so make sure you stay tuned to the end for those mmm you guys can see that it takes um that let's roll some out first yeah we've got dirtied abdill's let's clean that one up all right cools off y'all Miller wax up you back for now alright let's give a little hop out there and we'll spread it on the paper you guys can see that it is kind of orange like punkin orange or something I wanted to focus on their real good to spread some on the paper and roll some up and talk about it get up here where I can see it get a little more glob on there so how's everybody doing out there where you got smoking on tonight it's a rain in here so it's a crappy night hopefully clears up so I can get some work done tomorrow or we'll stay at home and shoot some videos one of the two all right we got some of that roll down there you can see that a little better but it is got an orange look to it now I've been doing a lot of research on this one and trust me it took a minute to figure it out well not really to figure it out figured it out pretty quick but to get confirmation that I was correct they advertise this as soft wax and if you looked on their website it even showed a picture in the picture they showed was more of a I don't know like a butter consistency you couldn't even see through it this stuff is got a clearer consistency you can kind of see through it a little bit all right got one twist it up you can see the wax in there a little bit out spider this up all right so this is the my active native was coming at 69 percent THC almost 70 69 and a half that's about all it says on there now from looking at it and I've been tricked once or twice before I kind of knew something wasn't quite right it wasn't you know wax wax and I called the call center a couple times and I will say something you can sit in a parking lot at the store see nobody in the store called a number from the store and they'll say we're helping in-store customers and they'll switch you to the call center but option for on the call centers if you have a problem with the product hit for when you get four it says something about our products are on the on line and the hang up on you so the customer service isn't the best for that I called the call center probably three or four times and asked different questions on it and kind of got to run around each time but finally when I got in the store again you picked up some of the Tillamook strawberry we'll do a quick review on that here for the end to the girl did in it this is this distillate the same thing rides and bike ran tried to put in the chart and tell us there was something different now I will say because I'm not a dis little to fan at all I think it has a waxy taste to it when you try to dab it and just not a fan out this I will say is the tastiest distillate I've had so far like I said I tried true leaves when I first started out you know because people's refilling the vape carts with those I didn't care for it it was too hard to draw on and then you know by decaying got me with their honey well they said kept saying was a honey consistency which ended up being distillate in the jar and then Rises terpene nectar or turkey soup whatever it was was just a little of flavoring but that's what this is it's gonna be a distillate we do have our banger nice and clean up so we'll take a little dab it is very quick it is just just a little with turf flavors in it and it terpenes like I said it does taste good it spreads good it works well on the paper for me crap so if you're using it to spread it in a joint this stuff works pretty good it is a little distant a different consistency as what your true clear would be this is a little thicker and not quite as you know true clear is a little runny and drip you kind of like thick syrup this is more like and it kind of looks like caramel in there but it's more the consistency I'd say like butter so it does spread good let's do a little dab of it and see what it tastes like I got my little dollar tree timer here so we're gonna heat this up for a minute now the Maya cat native said it was a sativa dominant hybrid I found it to be a pretty you know balanced hybrid in my opinion at least how it works for me but like I said when I first got this and brought it home and opened it up you know if you can't see it in the store and like I said if you go on the ceteris website and look at it and it's like to the side it'll show another picture worth a jar open and it has like a it looks more like a butter it's more yellowish sort of mine's more orange so like I said it had different consistency than what looked like what I got so that was a little bit upsetting and I didn't try it for a few days because you know I don't care for distillate wasn't that cool for a minute but then I kept getting the runaround you know I kept calling the call center and I'm like you know cuz a good thing to check for if it's dis Liz ask him if you can eat it if you can eat it it's definitely distillate because shatters and waxes aren't D carved and they're like well you can but you won't get the effects you're not supposed to this and that well like I said when I finally got into the store the girl in there is like yeah it's distillate that should be cool enough we'll see if we can get that in there and get a hit on it yeah I'm not a fan of dabbing that oh yeah then we add it Terps just don't dive right my opinion oh yeah I'll keep putting that in joints I have a spicy taste when you dab it and maybe a little soapy yeah well something I don't care for that like I said it's good in the joint though damn glide it and dab that the first time cuz I'll probably put that back out oh so that one oh man I can't get that taste that one out sorry it just join again that's one I would say get at your own risk it is distillate if you like distillate and you like to dab distillate give it a shot if you want something that's gonna be easy to roll up in a joint that's gonna work too if you're looking for something for flavor I wouldn't pick that one maybe they the strains might taste a little different I've never had this on the flour the flour they did have in was like 12% into my echo that's my passed on it yeah sorry guys spitting in the trashcan don't order target that taste out yeah I'm not care for that but like I said teachers home you might like it you might not everybody's got different flavors out there or different taste buds and all that like I said we did grab some flour at true leaf they had I stopped in there on Monday after work I don't know what is it today Tuesday the only thing they had left was the gorilla grapes which was surprising cuz he said this was the highest THC coming at 23.8 do you think the highest stuff woulda went first you guys know I'm not a fan of the taste of the gorilla grapes really I don't really like to grow a glues at all this is better than the grow of glue it doesn't have that strong rubber glue taste I did pick up two of them you know 27 bucks you can't really beat it nice looking bud nice whole track thumbs on there this stuff does give me I think we've already did a review on it before so it gives me a little bit worse cottonmouth the grape flavor is a little dry to me but grapes in general you know if I eat grapes I'm thirsty grapes kind of give me a dry mouth and then I did have 10% off for my rewards that you want to get like 500 truly points you get 10% off so they had some of the skunk ape a few you guys said it was good so we're gonna give it a shot they're like a dumbass I didn't ask the THC count on it and it's 15.8 so we haven't even opened this one yet don't know if you guys was was 15 that said was good but hopefully it was the mines good they're sparkly I don't know if you can see that look dry just a little bit on the outside but I can feel a little inner little craft a little moisture packing these and these aren't the minis these are the full size so this was 43 well like I said you can see the little shine on the hairpin there I think it ended up being 38 with my discount breaking these open hmm it's got a different smell to it so yeah well freshen that one up we'll do a review on it so let's see we got some new products and some new price structures grow healthy has got a new price structure well I guess not a new price structure they got minis or popcorn whatever you want to call them now they sent me an email a day or two ago hang on a second nose is still running you know saying they was gonna have smalls or popcorn whatever they call them the eighth was gonna be 30% off so it made them $35 and ate 50% off when you bought a hat so a half pounds cuz they're 50 our ate said grow healthy so 50% off the half is $100 for half ounce which isn't a bad deal makes it a little bit cheaper than true leave if you buy it by the half ounce if you don't you're paying $35 so you're back up to you know like Rises price but they haven't had any in yet I don't know why they drop that knowledge and we'll get to the second one here in a second and then not have that product in I called the last couple days and they're like still nothing I don't know why they did that now fluent which was formerly Knox they're gonna come out with no I say come out with the sit an email out so it could be six months down the road we never know if you remember truly said months ago they was going to have snow I think it was and sauce in there blue river rosin wine we started see not yet so don't get your hopes up too much yet but it could be out in the next couple days you never know I'm hoping maybe on Friday or something but they're going to come out with the Oh what was it well it looks like bubble hash they're calling it a melt but it's an ice extract this is what the packaging said because that's all I send you as a picture of the packaging it's was an ice water extract so on the guess in the melt is going to be like a bubble hash and inner Oz and it's going to be pretty much impressed bubble hash so I don't know if that will consist of if it'll be live browsing or if they're going to use it from dried flower so it'll be but it's something different or at least a different process of getting the rosin the bubble hash will definitely be new but like I said it bitten pests that specify in there if it was going to be from dried flower or fresh green buds so I guess that makes a little different to what the end product will turn out to be but they have released a price or anything like that on it yet also you guys if you had noticed we're doing a collab video it's me le k Celtic tech and me t69 me 269 already put her video out you guys can go check it out I plan on getting mine out here before Christmas I think Celtic tech is gonna try to get hers out before Christmas or right after she's not feeling good right now so and then I'm not sure I think Ellie K is gonna get hers out in the next day or so I'm not real sure on that one but make sure you check out all three of the other girls if you haven't subscribed to them subscribe to them I'll leave a link in my video when I posted here the next day or two I might have a chance to do it tomorrow if there that's right and now so my works outside tomorrow so cos rain holds up I'll be holed up in the garage again so mmm and I think I said everybody else is still doing you know some discounts for the holidays true leaves running through their 12 days of Christmas sometimes in their um your leaf is doing something different every day too but you have to show the email is what it says or you have to show the text or whatever so you just can't go in there and say I've seen it on Facebook or something like that so if you haven't signed up for their emails and text alerts you might want to go ahead and do that also when you do that they send you a coupon that you have to show that text to I guess and they get you a flat flower price of 39 bucks and I believe that was till the end of the year I thought it was just a one-time thing but I thought I've seen somewhere else that was till the end of the year that flat flower price but that doesn't work with any other discounts or anything like that but even if you get a discount that flat flower price on some of their $53 strains still might be a better deal I think that's it not too many people is doing a lot of discounts it seemed like it was just truly a purely if invite a can is the ones I see doing a daily deal I guess move is to but there's or just seems like they're not every single day it's like the deal last a day or two long and then they have another one the last two days long if you can just have to go their website and look I don't get notifications from them either for some reason and that's about all I see I didn't see a lot of other ones I haven't seen anything really from grow healthy except for the the littles coming out and like I said that was two days ago this doesn't bid any littles so terror doesn't really do discounts at all I don't believe that much I really haven't seen anything from them all we gots our flour from now we didn't show that we talked about the one day but I don't even think I ever showed it got one little nugget in here now this was the Tillamook strawberry which I was kind of excited about you know because I'm a flavor guy so the strawberry was calling my name this come in at 16% now I would like to add something here because I see a lot of people you know I'm around on Facebook all that crap and like say the northern hash plate come out on Monday everybody will show it that from any dispensary wherever it come from they're all going to be 19.7 across the board I don't see any fluctuation in the same batch that comes out no in ceteris I've seen people I just watched Lake I think it's l.a yke he's a new medical marijuana here in Florida he had this today and this was 14% and they're the same you know batch numbers they only had one batch to come out so far so I believe cetera is really testing a lot more to where other ones aren't so - whereas this might say 20 or 19 it might actually be 17 you know if they talk they're just testing the top buds on the plant and not the bottom ones or the biggest best-looking playing how the whole guard and not the little scraggly ones but it seems like sorter is doing a little bit more testing because their THC is a little bit more all over the place and you're not seeing that in other dispensaries so that's one good thing I will say you're actually I believe you're getting exactly what they say you're getting here now this wasn't bad you know it's got some little crystals on there there's a nice tight bud structure Teva dominant for me and it wasn't a bad strain it wasn't a bad high but the flavors wasn't quite there was supposed to be like you know a strawberry field in the middle of a gas station or something like that it had like a berry taste to it but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was strawberry um and it had a little fuelie taste but I wouldn't go as far as to say twas diesel II I would say it was more of like a very fuel and it was supposed to be more diesel e strawberries so I'd say that flavors was definitely not quite to where they should be on that like I said it should have more of a robust strawberry taste and a you know with a diesel taste to it and it didn't it taste it more like I don't want to go as far as I say a blueberry but maybe like a blueberry with a mixed berry in it you was little blueberry in theirs but more of a fuel than a diesel taste you know I mean I don't if that makes sense to you guys I don't know that it's best way I can explain it but I don't like I said I don't think the taste was quite where it should be it on that better than that it wasn't bad it was thirty bucks I'd probably get him again I'll probably give him a couple a little bit see if they get their act together a little better and plus the only thing they had here was that my akan native which was down like 12 or said I'm not a fan of the granddaddy purple and that was their indica the Jackie girl was pretty good but it was a little bit probably more sativa than I like so I probably wouldn't get that one again I probably get the strawberry again I like the effects on it we just hope the flavor would come out a little better next time but like I said if you want something a little more sativa a little more energetic Jackie girl wasn't bad I was cutting the Jackie girl with some of the decorator wasn't bad you never know I probably get that when he gave it anyways it wasn't like I said a bad one was a little energetic I do like an energetic sativa all right guys that's gonna be it if I hear wind fluent is gonna come out I tried to make a few phone calls today and nobody just knew it nothing there like we all know what you get that a lot in this industry I hear this nobody knows anything that's going on and they don't communicate with their staff very well put it that way but like I said as soon as I find out when it's gonna be released I'm definitely gonna take a drive and try it out because I've had never had bubble hash or ice water hash or whatever you want to call it so we'll definitely see what they're like and I guess that's it guys hopefully you took it on something good out there hopefully you're subscribed to me and like I said if you haven't seen meet these videos meet you 69 check her out like I said I will leave a link I'll put a video up here in the next couple days I don't know quite well in the title I think it's going to be the top strain for 2019 or something like that or something but that's gonna be the collab video like so she put hers out yeah but I will leave a link to her video and a link to Ellie's channel if you guys don't know who she is I don't know where you've been living um and then Celtic Tech she's on here all the time you guys know her I think that's it guys like said make sure you subscribe if you haven't checked out those other guys check them out check out lake - I'll leave a couple link to his channel in one of my videos here coming up soon I got a kind of special video I got a couple special videos coming out I think you guys will enjoy hopefully you enjoy all of them but these are going to be something a little different little fun I just got to get my button here but if we get too many more rainy days that gives me a bunch of time so like said the guys that'll be it until next time keep on talking my friend", "gDH0-cuf724": "hey everyone Ally here and today I'm going to be doing a review on the Nair Brazilian spa clay roll-on wax so waxing your only legs this is something that I started looking into because I just get really tired of shaving my legs all the time I did some research online and then was poking around and it looked seemed like a lot of people liked this stuff so I decided to give it a try and turns out I love it it's super easy to use I've experienced with like some of my friends when they use wax and it just gets everywhere it's an impossible to get off or you have to get like a special solution to get it off this just comes right off with water so it's really easy to clean up and you don't have to use any complicated warmers or anything like that because you just pop this baby in the microwave the only thing about this stuff is that it comes with ten sheets of paper strips to use I do recommend going out and buying your own better quality strips to use with this stuff it just hurts less and it seems like it sticks better to the wax these are by a suddenly smooth or something like that but they almost feel like really thin foam it's kind of weird and they work a lot better than the ones that come with the narrow wax before you get messing with heating the wax up the first thing you want to do is wash your legs just to make sure that they're free from any oils or product or anything because you want the hair to be clean so the wax can stick to it and rip it right out also don't watch anything if you're in a hurry make sure you have lots of time to take your time and relax and do things the right way if you try to wax anything when you're in a rush most likely it'll just not work out good you'll miss hairs you might tear skin it just give yourself some time give you some time when you open the package the first thing you want to do is just unscrew this guide and take out this little plastic plug otherwise it might explode or something I don't know but it's somewhere safe because you're going to want to put it back in later when you're done and put this cap back on and then you're going to stick this bad boy in the microwave for 15 seconds to start off when it's cold and then do like increments of 5 to 10 seconds to keep it want to get it so that inside you can see in the bottle that it's nice and liquidy and ice flowing around real smooth then you can just squeeze it and work it around and make sure you want to spread the heat around evenly a few quick tips if you have long hair definitely get it up out of the way normally when you do this you would wear I would just wear underwear but obviously since I'm in this video I'm just wearing my lil yoga shorts they are something where your sleeves and get up out of the way because while yes this is really easy to get out with why are you still don't want to get everywhere so just try you know use some common sense of that this plastic thing that it comes with doubles as a stand for the wax so whenever you're in between wax things you can just pop it in there like this so keep this because this is important so how long does the hair on your legs need to be um people say like around 2 weeks of growth or something like that from shaving um I usually end up if I want to keep up with it I wax my legs like once a month I'd say um the hair on my legs is pretty long but it's also fairly fine so I don't even know if you can see it you're just going to roll on one or two layers and you don't want obviously I want to go longer than the strip because you won't get it all at once so we're just gonna this going okay you roll the direction of the hair and then smooth on the strip nice and firm in the direction of the hair and then pull tight on the skin and then you're going to rip backwards be careful not to rip up because that will hurt and that work very good oh and you can use the strip more than once um I usually just keep going with the same strip until the wax on the strip is getting a little too thick and after you do it a few times you know what I'm talking about but so it's pretty quick and easy and it's very efficient um I hardly ever I have very few missed hairs when I do this remember you want to go in the direction of the hair when you're applying the wax and the strip and pull this tight and then go in the opposite direction this part gets kind of awkward getting behind your leg can be difficult might need to have someone help you with this part once you get the hang of it gets easier for sure kinda have to do some funky twisting sometimes to get the wax on where you need it to go yeah so as you can see I've got quite a lot of wax built up on here so this is when I will throw this one way use a new strip you want the wax when you're applying it on your leg to just go on like really smooth and liquid like so I can tell this already needs a little reheat so I'm just going to pop in the microwave for a few seconds remember when you reheat your wax do it a little bit at a time it's really key overheat it tin you lean on so what I do is I go in patches around the lower half of my lower leg I go all the way around in a row and then I'll do the top half well I know some of you are wondering right now how much does this actually hurt well it definitely gets better and do it more and more and the more you the more you wax the less hair will grow or grow back less resilient to me so will be easier to rip it out and they'll be less of it so that reduces the pain definitely hurts a lot less than when I first did this pain area just depends on how strong your hair is how thick it is how much of it you have so and is it worth it you know for me definitely if you have a lot more hair that's a lot tougher to get rid of it might be worth it for you to go have them wax professionally but honestly you know this is going to save me like $50 moving on up I only wax from the knee down because my hair my thighs is really fine definitely do your knees separate from the top of your leg so after I finish the top half of my way I'll go around once more for my knee and I'll show you what I do for that for your knee what I've found the easiest thing to do is make sure your leg is bent so that pull all of this nice and tight and because your knee is round and bony it's kind of difficult to get but you just got to have patience with it take little sections just a little sections sure you get it nice and firm pull it tight tight as you can and get that off make sure you pull the skin as tight as possible I did this once because you already have a loose skin on your knee right so you can bend it and I did this once like with my legs straight or something I don't know what I was doing I thought it was going to be okay and hurt really bad so don't do that so remember take little sections is your knees a funny shape and I've all done it's seriously so easy guys after you're finished watching waxing your legs what I actually do is as soon as I'm done and just hop in the shower and go ahead and give them a once-over with my razor just to catch any hairs I might have missed as well as it helps your skin feels even more silky smooth because or razor really exfoliates your skin and of course don't forget to follow up with a gentle soothing moisturizer if you're finding it difficult to rip the paper off try not to think about it too hard um sometimes you can sing a song don't count because once you get to three you know it's coming and then you'll check it out again if you sing a song to yourself or something like that just kind of try to distract while you're ripping then you won't cringe as much or anticipated much and might even help to make it hurt less so that concludes my leg waxing tutorial it loves stuff I highly recommend it um I give it from Target fairly cheap um I think it's like between eight to ten dollars and this container lasts me for four legs my bottom from the knee down like I said you better off come getting your own strips once you are done waxing your legs all you have to do turn this guy by the other directions a little wax settles back down here take off the lid put the plug back in and then I just rinse off clean out this whole thing I just pop this lid off and put the plug back in and then just rinse off that part isn't getting sticky and then this here if you just push on the roll apart it actually pops out up here just like that so you can get this whole part nice and clean and all you need is a nice warm water to get this back to me again and once that's reached your desired level of cleanliness you can just pop this little roller guy back in and put this back in and don't forget to rinse off your handy dandy little holders and voila you are all set hope that helped you guys

it fire you I'm kidding okay what am I doing with my life okay so today we're gonna be playing Rainbow Connection on the ukulele and I'm gonna teach you how to do this so before we get a little too far I want to show you a neat little trick I found for the ukulele that kind of makes it sound cool it kind of makes it sound like muted but like like it makes it sound like a telephone if you want to make it sound like that all you need is a rubber band just a simple rubber band just like this doesn't matter how stretchy or loose it is but just kind of think I guess like this [Music] [Applause] so today we're going to be playing Rainbow Connection Rainbow Connection so if you already know these chords you can just take a look at these are you sure you've got this down so anyway let's do this and I kind of teach you some chords first and then we're gonna start on the song the first chord we're gonna do is a so a super easy take your first finger place it on the third string first fret and take your second finger place it on the fourth string second fret and it should sound like this the next chord is G E minor I think that's how you say it but I don't know so correct me if I'm wrong okay anyway so our next chord is we're talking about is I'm going to be like this so it's literally just going to be the same thing as a and all you're gonna do is take your third finger put it on the second string and 2nd fret so it's literally just gonna be having your hand here and then placing one there like that's all you have to do a G B minor C it sound pretty similar the next one is D here's how to do that what I do just to make it a little bit easier is I just take my first finger and place it across the whole thing but that's kind of you can choose to do whatever so not not them it's hard to see not this first strength but just the last three strings so next is 87 should the next one is B - what you're gonna do is take your first finger just place it on these three here a three kind of bar chord on the second fret and then you're gonna take your third finger just because it's easier to stretch over rather than like trying to reach over so just take your third finger and reach over like that great that looks that's pretty cray cray cray - a cray cray cray so the next last one is DB minor seven I don't know I don't know somebody explain that to me so that one is pretty simple so you're gonna take your first finger put it on the fourth string first fret and you're gonna take your second finger put it on the third string first fret take your third finger put it on the first string second fret to finish it sound like this so now I'm gonna teach you how to do it the first first is going to start with a GMB I'm just gonna say that a GMB de7 and then you're gonna do that four times so you start with a and then GMB d and e seven I'll just repeat it a couple of times for you guys a GM B D I'm gonna get four times and then after that it's going to go D to D be M and then you go to your Rainbow Connection part you're gonna do B minor C seven a and g mb b minor someday and then you seven will find it and then a the rainbow and then Gee Gee Gee Bee tion and then and then after that it's going to be back to B minor then you go to seven and then back to a so pretty simple hopefully you could figure that out and follow along but it's not okay so now I'm just gonna play the whole thing over so you know what it sounds like [Music] well I hope you enjoyed my they do if you have any other music suggest junk I mean music suggest songs such as gems then make sure to tell me even though I only have like couple people so I don't think like people will actually come in like you know whatever so yeah just um see you later", "OO65GrNTGHg": "hey guys this is Andrew with rock class 101.com today we're going to be learning the theme for Game of Thrones and this is probably being one of the most popular requests that I've been receiving and it's probably just because it's such a love show in such a hugely watched TV show I actually think the theme is quite a lot of fun and it adapted pretty well to the uke it's just such a interesting sounding song it's so catchy with that bad data and that theme that builds throughout it it's just was a lot of fun to put on you so this is going to be part one of a lesson and in part one we're going to be learning the complete intro and the verse if you guys want to learn the rest of the tune you can do so in part two of the lesson at rock class 101 so the second part of the video lesson will cover the verse variation it's going to cover the chorus the chorus variation and the outro so the complete rest of the tune plus you can also get the complete tabs to print off as a PDF format and get access to that on-screen tab here which literally you can hit play with this performance slow it down to whatever speed you want and you watch the tab scroll across in real time just a great asset and learning this song that much quicker so all that's at rock class 101.com so let's go ahead and kick into this lesson so we're going to kick off with the intro and our intro sounds like this okay you can notice that it's looping the same thing four times in a row and then it does another variation on that four times in a row so it's not very very hard what we're actually playing does involve a hammer-on technique so we're going to talk about that basically for the first set of four what I'm going to do is I'm going to play completely with my thumb on my right hand and I'm going to hit string four open and then string three and then we have our hammer on so it's going to be our first finger on the third fret of the third string and we're going to play that note again with our thumb and hammer on the five on string three so hammer on is basically you pick the note once and then use that finger to hammer on with enough force to create the volume on its own without using another pick alright so I pick once and I hammer on so if you haven't done hammer ons before just give it a shot and just practice it the goal of a hammer on is to create the same volume in between this note and this one that you hammer on but what it does is it cuts back on the work for the right hand plus it gives it a more interesting sound to switch it up so again we have open for open three and then three to five on string three pick one time so it sounds like that again we have one two three and one two one two so that's our rhythm that we're gonna be playing you can also think of it as da da da bobba really really simple and catchy rhythm so looping that again four times without me calling it okay now the next set of four is basically like a variation on this we're going to do the same beginning open for open three but this time around we're going to hit the second string open and hammer onto the first fret of string 2 so 0 to 1 on string 2 and for my right hand I'm going to go thumb thumb and then second finger to pluck string to right so same rhythm and you can see when I hammer on I'm just going to leave that finger down so that it just sustains into those opens that following right it just gives it a nice sustaining sound so you have four of those in a row so now we know the whole intro so if I play the intro all the way throughout it sounds like this okay and that's what we get for the first part of this arrangement so now we're going to move into the verse so we're going to play a few of these bars at a time and then break it down so here's what the first part of this sounds like okay so our first chord is going to be a c5 to do this we're going to take our pinkie put it on the tenth fret up string one and then your middle finger on eighth on string to the other strings above it are going to be open so open three open for I'm gonna go ahead and strum this first chord and then I'm going to pick out of it I'm going to hit string four and then string to remember keep those two fingers planted for right now so we're gonna go shoot um for two right and these are all quarter notes or even three okay after that bar two for the verse I'm gonna go so I'm going to strum three and two together or you could plug them every one doesn't matter hit both of those together string three in two and then hit string four and then string two again so I have three and two together string four string two all quarter notes all the same like the time so if I put bar one and two together I have 44 to write all even quarter notes again okay and if I call the rhythm one two three okay the next two bars are going to sound like this okay so you can see that I'm still out of that c5 chord shape but we've got quite a bit more going on with our third finger being added to the mix now so what we're going to do is we're going to take our index finger and we're going to put it on the sixth fret up string one right so what I'm going to get for the first one is I'm going to lift my pinky up from that c5 right we had c5 which was second finger and fourth finger lift that pinky up we don't need it for right now put the index finger on six on string one keep the middle on eight on two so we're going to pluck string three open and hit string one which is the 6th fret together then we're going to take that ring and we're going to hammer on to 8th on string one so you pluck three and one together and then hammer on pluck hammer on pluck hammer on after that your pinky is going to go to 10 on string 1 play that and then hit the open for so again we have 3 and 1 hammer on to eight with the ring go back to 10 on one with the pinky and then play open for so our rhythm is gone into so you have a eighth note followed by two quarters that add that right one and two three so get that stuck in your head okay the next bar bar for for the verse is going to go so it's like a variation so we're going to again strum three and two only open for after that and then hammer on six to eight so you've noticed that that middle finger stays anchored four bar three and four of the verse the entire time doesn't go anywhere again bar four strums three and two open four and six to eight on string one same hammer on we did before so if we put bars three and four together for the verse we have okay now if we put bars one through four together for the verse we have okay so that's basically what our first four bars for the very sound like let's go ahead and look at the next set of four and it's going to be all out of a G minor so a lot of these bars actually are the same so it's going to make this next section quite easy learn because it repeats so here's what the next four sound like we're going to loop all these together this number okay so our chord shape is an E minor right just that staircase that stock staircase a minor we make we're going to move it up the neck so you're going to take that ring put it on seven on string three your middle finger on six on string to add your index finger on five on string one string four is going to be played open so the first hit is just going to be strumming all four and then hitting open four and then where you go six to eight on string 2 so that middle finger is going to hammer on with the pinky six to eight on string to our rhythm is one two three end so we have quarter quarter eighth note so again some four six eight on string to hammer on okay now here's where the section repeats these next two bars are going to double so the second bar for G minor you're going to be playing string three and one together and then open four and then again the same hammer on six to eight so we have three and one open four and then six eight so same rhythm one two if I play without calling okay so the first three bars put together have shrub for your clock for your clock for head and without calling okay the last bar for this g-minor is gonna go show four and add your pinkie to eight on string to again it's shrub or eight on two and those are all quarter nuts okay so this G minor section again put together that's what we get all right let's move on to the second half of this verse okay so our next four bars go into B flat chord so let's learn that shape real quick and then I'll play it throughout and we can see how these four bars are based out of that chord shape so chord shape looks like this and basically we're going to put our first finger on five on string three our middle finger on six on string 2 and our pinky on 8 on string three okay and we're ignoring string four so only strum three down so here's what that section sounds like so like I said most of this is just staying straight out of that B flat 5 chord and then we're moving a couple fingers to do that little pull-off lick that happens so basically we're just arpeggiating out of the chord so the first one is going to start with a strum and then playing three and two and these are all quarters one two three right so all even notes okay the second bar is going to go strum three and two kind of like we did before right and then again three two so the first one we have strum three two one three two the second one strum three two two three okay put together slow down okay the next bar here's where it gets a little tricky it's going to do a quick little pull off and then stretch to pinky and then play the octave of that so what happens is that I'm going to lift my pinky up from that B flat five I'm going to drop my middle finger to six on string one but my index is going to bar so you're going to bar five down only strings one two and three right remember we're ignoring string four for this whole section so I'm barring five down and I'm pulling six two five off so it would be a pull off right there right the pull off is the opposite of a hammer on so hammer on was hammer on right a pull off is the opposite pulling up right but it's not directly up when you pull off you want to tug down a little bit on it right in the same goal applies we want both notes to do the same volume okay so I pull off and then reach with my pinky to eighth on string one and then play string three which remember is barred so it's the fifth fret okay I rhythm is one and two three so we have eighth notes one and quarter quarter right one and two three so I played again sounds like this okay slow off eight five okay here's what the first three bars sound like together okay so the fourth bar to finish this section it will sound like this so basically it's just hitting string two and then playing string three and two together and then string three right so we have two three and two together and then three and these are all quarter notes point three right so same rhythm for this our same duration of note for this section so that completes those four bars guys all together we sound like this okay now the next part these next four bars are going to start one quick hit with that six to five before it goes to this F minor chord right for that last section so you're going to do a quick six to five again right same finger so you got to bar that six two five two pulls off to the index bar and then you're going to move this bar down to the third fret but what happens in this last section is that instead of covering from three down you're going to cover from two down and with two down covered we're going to play string three and string one together so three is open now and then it's going to do four to six on string 2 right so it's a hammer-on I use my middle and pinky just like that so I pluck four to six so that first bar for the last four for F minor is going to go okay so again our rhythm is one and two and right so we have 1 & 2 3 n right so little tricky now the next two bars are identical they sound like this okay so we're going to plug 3 & 1 3 again is open one is barred on strings 1 & 2 on the third fret open for after that and then again 4 to 6 middle and pinky we have that same rhythm s throughout this arrangement 1 2 3 & 1 2 3 now the last bar is going to sound like this all quarter nuts so plucking three and one open for and string one one two three so again three and one open for and then the third fret of string one so that gives us the complete verse guys so let's go ahead just play those last four bars and we're after that we're going to put all the verse together okay so let's go ahead and play that verse all the way throughout now so here we go alright guys I hope you enjoyed this lesson again if you want to learn the rest of this tune you can

but I'm gonna be showing you how to play see you again bye time to crater this is inspired by the cover that I did so I'm gonna link that down below if you would like to check it out but let's get to it so right here I have an acoustic-electric concert ukulele and it's a Mitchell ukulele if you'd like to find this ukulele online or any of the other ones that I own I always list them down below in the description so check that out if you want to but let's get to it so first off I use no capo so you don't need to worry about that second off the chords are actually pretty easy in my opinion yeah they're not too bad there are lemony there are only four and I'm gonna listen down below right now and if you already know how to play these chords feel free to skip ahead to the time stamp I'm gonna have below right now but if you don't know how to play these chords there's no need to fret I got you I want to show you how to figure them so to start off with being able to know how to play F so f let's start off on the second fret and then put your middle finger on the top string right there that's the G and then put another finger down your pointer finger second from the bottom string the E right there and it's just sound like this [Music] next you need to know how to play ad minor so for D minor let's start off with the first fret put a finger down on that same string second from the bottom and then put a finger down on the top string right there and then put another finger down on the second or the top string on the second fret and it should sound like this next you need to know how to play D minor red G minor put a finger down on the bottom string on the first fret the a then put a finger down on the second fret the second top string that's the C and then put a finger down on the third fret on the second from the bottom string the E and it kind of creates this triangle shape and it sounds like this [Music] and lastly you need to know how to play c7 c7 it's really easy I'm gonna show you it's on the first fret put a finger down on that bottom string right there the a and it sounds like this so to play this song I start off with that verse and I do this really interesting strumming pattern I'll show you it it's really easy but I'm going to show you what it sounds like first and then I'll break it down so I go so it doesn't it's not hard at all I'm gonna show you exactly what I was doing so the chords you're always going to be playing those same four chords in order throughout the whole song so so if it's the F it's C minor G minor and c7 so to start off you're gonna be strumming and then you you study strong this is an F you strum and then you kind of knock like unequally that's what I did you don't have to do that you can just strum down tunes but I thought it was kind of fun so let's do it together and F so and strong knock-knock strong knock back stop knock-knock and I don't really knock on that last woman you can't if you want so now let's do it singing together so one two ready go F knock knock knock knock you live in a dream state and that's how I started it off moving on from that that second part of that verse is when I start off the strumming pattern that I use for the tire like the rest of the whole song I did Chuck I know sometimes some of you guys get a little frustrated because it is very difficult to chuck when you're starting to play the ukulele so I'm gonna show you that Cermak pattern the one I did with checking but I'm also going to include an alternative one that you can like use instead so this is the one that I did with the chucking and it is I'm gonna be playing the F and something to remember is that you're only doing that strumming pattern once for each chord so for example I'm gonna go in the order again it's F D minor G minor and c7 so [Music] something like that last time just kind of down strum instead but it's personal preference so that's the strumming pattern that I did rewatch that excuse me I'm a little sick but rewatch that if you are still a little confused I understand it'll be a little bit confusing at first but here's an alternative strumming pattern in case you want to not chuck at all so it's gonna be the same chord so something to keep in mind with this strumming pattern is that you're actually doing it twice per chord instead of once which is what you did with the other strumming pattern so I'm going to show you so let's do an F and it is hope this is making sense so let's do the whole chord progression out so start off with that and switch switch [Music] don't strong for that last one so again let's do it in it f so I forgot that residency seven so those are the serving patterns I'm going to continue on with the checking one because that's the one that I did in my cover but feel free to continue on with the other one if it's better for you learn from the top [Music] you live in my dream state and any time that's the only time makeup you exist so let's do that second part again together slower that's the only time makeup you exist [Music] I hope this is making sense remember you can always use the other storming pattern if it's easier for you so just kind of letting that putting that out there and the rest of the song is the same honestly it is it's the entire same chord progression same chords but we're gonna go through it together pre chorus so 20/20 vision I'm gonna take it slower sound strong and that was that we're moving out to the chorus I'm just gonna keep going since this is like the same thing over and over again just obviously different lyrics but going into the chorus then you go can I get it can you make it [Music] and I'm not doing the alternative strumming pattern right now for any of these guys that are doing that rule [Music] [Applause] so it like it sounds good unless he does it's just a little bit different but remember with that one you have to do the strumming pattern twice for each chord instead of once like the chucking one that I'm doing so I hope that makes sense continuing on we're just gonna do the second verse and then I'm gonna end this video because again we're doing the same thing over and over again I don't want to keep you here for too long but this is the rapping verse I love this verse so much take it slow for all of you that want to sing it I promise I don't really rap I kind of sing it as you know but yeah just take it slow honestly if you are like really looking forward to doing it so let's do it starting off with the F I said okay okay okay okay my maturation is leading to another but you Mollett love oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah let you happen sorry I've been looking stop the way sugary nasty bumble bee on the seat yeah I'd give up my baby to have a piece of it bloody and that's the whole song basically you do the I'm sorry I'm sick again but use you the pre-chorus and then after that you do the chorus again and the song kind of just ends that's how I played it I hope this was helpful can I get a kiss and you make it last forever", "tkQV2EzGjT4": "I'm excited dudu hi everyone today I'm making do-it-yourself ear candles my first time doing this but it's gonna be fine we can do this together I've got a pair so the things you will need they're made out of cotton and then they're soaked in beeswax on both sides so these little sheets I bought online and then the things that I got myself a chopstick which is about the right dimension for my ear long enough to fit the beeswax paper in got a little bit of cotton fabric and I've just chosen an organic olive oil you keep reapplying between ear candles so I hope that makes sense let's get going I'm excited first up oil your fabric then you need to slightly heat the beeswax cotton that one is hotter I can feel this it's it's more flexible before the heat it's kind of yeah it moves more doesn't it curl up the paper I should go your fingers and roll away apply pressure as you roll so when it cools down and hardens it stays in place so let's slide it off oh that was easy I've got very small ear holes that's good this little test feels a bit horrible but I think that's gonna work when I have my person helping me burn the ear candles I'm not gonna do it on my own and you shouldn't do that it's not safe so now I'm gonna do a couple more maybe a hundred let's see how I go the oil on the chopstick or blast concentration oh yes I feel that it's a little bit tighter I'm gonna get a pot to put them in so that what I've got like 20 done they're not flying all over the place so the next couple I'll do speed it up for a bit of fun here we go he goes let's see how fast I can do 50 you the speed I just heated one side I think it's still going to work well", "gVICyKirS5E": "in this video I'm going to

welcome to a fingerstyle step-by-step tutorial of falling down by little peep and xxx 10,000 you'll go grab your tab sheets at patreon.com that will make this much easier okay so the chords were going to start out with playing is C the third fret of the a string a minor the second fret of the g string and E minor which is the second fret of the a string the third fret of this east ring and the fourth fret of the C string like that first middle ring finger the strum pattern you're going to use is down up scratch up up scratch up so it's going to sound something like this [Music] and repeat so you're gonna play the strum pattern twice on the C twice on the a minor and four times on the E minor that will repeat itself through the entire song so if you're playing with saw one of your friends your friend doesn't know the fingerstyle version of this song you can teach them this basic strumming pattern and these three simple chords and then you can play along on top of that and really impress your friends okay so this song is broken down into three different sections I'm gonna play them and then I'm going to describe them to you the first is the intro so it sounds something like this [Music] easy right and you're just gonna repeat that a number of different times throughout the song so I start with the middle finger on the 3rd fret of the a-string pinky for the fifth and then I like to just step down right from 3 to 2 with that middle finger I bring my thumb over to catch the 2nd fret of the g string so I can play an a minor there and then I play with a hammer on my first finger open and then you play it you pluck it again then I play the 3rd fret of the E string with my middle and I released that and I at the same time putting my ring finger on the 4th fret of the g string and playing both the open E and 4th fret C which are the same note they're both an e note and that's the intro so nice right and then rain keeps falling I call that the first verse you're going to start I'm gonna play it for you [Music] you're gonna repeat that twice so I play with my middle finger on the third fret of the e-string and I play three open open and don't play the a string on this note play pluck the third fret again and I put my first finger down on the second fret of the a string here I smash my first finger on the second fret of the a and E and I bring my ring finger over to play the fourth fret of the g string [Music] then I left off my first finger so I can play the open E and the fourth fret of the C ok the second verse just follows that portion and to play it it goes something like this [Music] so you think about it going into it you're here with your ring finger on the fourth string and that's why and you just take your first finger and tuck it under the third fret and you're gonna just play that the third fret of the a and the C string slide the first finger down to the second fret and I bring my thumb over middle finger plays the third fret of the E string and then I just played this simple a minor with my first middle and ring and I can strum down on that and then just catch it up with my first finger and that's the second verse so the whole song is consists of those three sections the intro verse one and verse two that I call it go grab the tab sheet it lists it out right there for you hope you guys enjoy this one this one's short it's nice and easy straightforward and it's awesome it's an amazing song a great place to start okay guys we will see you next time bye", "jKwr0iNbb_E": "it's been hey everyone welcome back to the 20 hour

left hand where our fretting hand if you're switching on the second fret of your fourth string so we're counting up from the bottom one two three four second fret we've got a nice arch under our finger so we can hear all four strings really clearly so make sure you got that then we're gonna add keep this finger down and add the index finger to the first fret of the second string don't you get that see what I'm doing here so make sure you've got that guy and make sure you can switch between a minor and F shake it out when you're ready the last chord is C we're gonna use our ring finger on the third fret or a first string so those the chords we use and one thing I'm really going to stress is try to keep your other all your fingers right over the frets where they're gonna play C when you're really experienced you'll be able to keep them about a centimeter away you might not get that right away that's okay to start working towards that so what we want to do is not have to work very hard to move between these chords so you see I'm gonna go right from a minor to C and just kind of switch the fingers and I have to do is left up the ring and put these two down they're already pretty much right there I'll switch back to C see it's really easy to change that way I call this making a shadow of a chord so I'm gonna leave my fingers in the shadow of the other chords that I'm playing so that we can move easily so there are the the the progression of the song basically has four different changes and where you just go a minor you go to see and then you go to F then you go to C and you can really play just the whole song with just those four chords I'll show you what I mean it's been a long day without you my friend and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again we've come a long way where we begin when I see you see that's really all there is the entire song it just loops that chord progression again and again so take a second make sure you can do this four chords in order and hear all four chords clear they'll let you I'll let you pause the video and work that out and come back when you're ready all right awesome so now that you're able to kind of switch between those comfortably what we're gonna do is we're gonna do the counting in this song we're going to feel a rhythm called three three two which is a really important rhythm it shows up in tons of styles of music so it's we're gonna start to learn how to feel that what you do is you count to three and then you count to three again and then count to two and that's kind of your rhythmic pattern it kind of feels like this you go one two one two three one two one two three one two three count with me 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 so that's the kind of the underlying idea even though you don't hear it stated and everything it's definitely it's the feel that's underneath everything so what happens is the first two times we say that the number one when we start those groups of three that's when we change chords so on the a minor we play one two three one two three one two so when we say the group of two we don't change we will be change on the three on the two groups of three so again will be like one two three one two three then one two three [Music] - so you see on the two groups of three from all four of the courts that's when we move so I'm gonna do that really really slowly a couple times and you're gonna try to play along try to count with out loud because that really helps your brain wake up the part that's counting and stay with me so let's try it all together and then I'm gonna show you just a little variation he uses with the two sometimes so here we go one two three one two three here we go so again you can practice that as many times as you need to you can use the YouTube app to slow it down or speed it up if you need to and I'll wait until you're ready and then I'll show you the the variations okay awesome sick party here we go so sometimes on the - he'll throw a G chord in there if you haven't done a G chord yet an easy variation you can do is just with two fingers as you can kind of do just the second fret and the 3rd fret of these kind of middle strings like this but generally what I'm gonna have people do is try to get three fingers in there and try to get the index finger on the second fret of the first string the ring finger on the third fret of the second string and middle finger on the second fret of the third time look at my hand really carefully try to find that so notice I'm kind of like I'm kind of twisting my arm a little bit this way what that does is that makes it easy for me to kind of fit all my fingers into a little pocket I'm kind of curving this a nice high curve on all of them they're all very rounded and let my wrist be pretty straight and they roll forward out of the tips of the fingers and just this little turn lets everything get really close to the frets because that should work really nicely [Music] so that's your G chord and every now and then he'll throw that g chord on that - I'm that sort of empty - there's a couple places where he does it in different parts of the song generally speaking it'll look kind of like this to see how he throws on the second group of three threw two throws the G one two three one two it's kind of a turnaround kind of it's a way of like adding a little bit of extra energy before you go back to the beginning of this cycle so let's try that a little bit slowly and then I'll sing the whole course and then you can you can play it with me so here we go with the variation one two three one two three [Music] one two two three one two three one two yeah so that's your variation and so one other little thing he does is when you play the chorus of the song sometimes he repeats the FC at the end when he goes mana when I see you again call it a tag where we take a little part at the end and we just kind of tag it on again so when he finishes the course he kind of tags that FC to finish it up so I'll do that here I'm gonna play it at speed again you can slow it down with the YouTube app if you want to play along and need more time to practice or you can play the speed with me it's totally up to you but here you'll see when I see you [Music] yeah great hope you dug that hope you take the 20 hour ukulele challenge it's a great way to get better at the instrument and yeah hope to see you in another lesson soon catch you later bye bye", "R9xxU9gxTUE": "[Music] uh-huh Kota flag get money back flip a sec he punished max racks on racks my song strip it

started this song is the easy song to learn I'm gonna teach you guys our chords and then to strum patterns that you guys can use for the song so the first one is a G to a B minor 7 [Music] didn't a sharpener so these are the chords we're going to be using for the entire song all right so the beginning of the song you're gonna hear the bass line which sounds like this so it's gonna be to dance chums for each chord so let's try it out and in this next room pattern you can use it for like the verse or right after the chorus so it goes like this that shown pattern is gonna be down up down up and on that second down up you're gonna hold the down just a little longer than the first down okay so we're gonna start off on the G and I won't try to play it all the way [Music] so that's basically the chords champagne that yes and use I also forgot to mention the tap in the to me the string so and that's pretty much it for the sauce so hopefully that helped you guys out don't you guys can check

video", "WIli8yuS0aA": "hey guys my name is Kira welcome back to my channel as you may be able to tell I've moved out of my bathroom and into a filming room which looks a whole lot better I just thought I needed a new space because the bathroom background just was not working while I was sitting on the ground it was highly uncomfortable you could see a beam in the back freaking tail hanging off the wall so I'm really excited my cousin has been awesome enough to let me use one of his spare bedrooms as my filming room it looks a little bare it's just a white background at the moment but I'm hoping to spice it up a bit you know get some pictures or candle or I don't know whatever flowing around to us so it's not as bare and hospital white but at the moment this is how it's gonna be all right so enough of my excitement about my new filming room in this video I'm gonna be talking about whether I personally think that waxing is worth it and more specifically down there it's a bit of an awkward and personal topic but whatever I'm just gonna jump straight in and give you guys the information that I know and my experiences with waxing versus shaving okay so I have a really sensitive skin when I shave my skin it doesn't like it it irritates it it's like off leave me alone what the hell are you doing with that me my body like no so I shave under my arms and in winter I shaved my legs just because it doesn't need to be shaved all the time you know a girl's got to keep warm with all that hair whatever um in summer I do like to wax my legs just because a lease of that little bit longer and I don't get those itchy red bumps and rashes from shaving I don't know it just doesn't agree with me under my arms I will just always shave I'm absolutely petrified of having that wax I don't know why down there in the nether regions I shaved for a very very long time it was my skin was irritated it was red it was like what she not blotchy but like bumpy my hair is very thick it's very very dark I have like black hey not on my head that's just like a brown my eyebrow is a quite dark but not black everywhere else black thick not nice about maybe three months ago I started going to get Brazilians and that was the best decision I've ever made I love it yeah it was scary I think the scariest part was actually just stripping down in front of someone and like open your legs sit like this like that it's like she's looking but I went back I did it again and again and again because it's amazing yeah it did hurt it hurt a little bit but not as much as I thought it would and I'm telling me it was so soft and this may be a bit awkward but when it grew back it it was like patchy I guess half the hairs didn't grow back like ever like that but that is gone and I don't know if that's just me or if that's just what happens like I know when you wax apparently has Athena I'm not actually sure if that's truth or a myth but I think when you shave you're literally just cutting the top off so when it grows back up it's prickly but when you wax you actually ripping like it out of the skin so when I go is back it's so soft I was like where is this being my whole life why haven't I done this I had to have quite sensitive skin which I mentioned earlier and I thought that waxing would irritate it but you didn't really it was about one day when it was still red and a little tender because obviously all my  hairs it getting ripped out of my body I think if you have thick dark hair I would definitely recommend waxing um I know that when I shave it you can like still see the hairs under the skin because my hair is so dark like it's look like I had hair but really there was no hair above skin like coming out and it always frustrated me so I don't know like it looked like my leg was still area like you shave then look hairy still wasn't her point I think you should give it a go no matter what kind of hair you have I think you should just give it a go it's easy it's not painless but it's not excruciating um and the more you get it done the less it hurts like first time I got it on I was like oh my god second time it it didn't really hurt much it is a bit embarrassing like stripping down from someone but how many vaginas have they seen a hell of a lot yours is no different I've seen a million vaginas and that's what I was trying to like get through my head when I was going in there seen it before they've seen everything yeah I think you should give it a go um you know if you're happy shaving that's fine go ahead and shave if you want to try something new try some waxing if you don't want the pain and maybe if you get like me that you're hated scheming shaving um maybe just try some hair removal cream that didn't really work for me like well like I just thought it was a waste of time shaving was just so much easier but there's all sorts of options so that's pretty much what I wanted to talk - you guys about explore your options definitely try waxing yeah because it's not as bad as people make it out to be unless I'm just like a freakin superhero or something I don't know yeah so I hope you find this video a little helpful um definitely give it a go you might regret it you might not I don't know but what else oh so that's how I'm going to leave it I hope you guys have an awesome day don't be scared to get a wax I would love it if you could like this video and subscribe to my channel and it would help me out a lot alright guys see", "FwouqrJPIQs": "what up everybody today I'm going to be learning giant woman by

way did you guess yeah it's West Virginia yeah someday they're gonna settle their differences with Virginia and they'll reunite I use that joke all the time North Carolina South Carolina North Dakota South they're always those States just hate each other if they hate each other and so someday they'll they'll all get together anyway that's West Virginia so I'll hang it up probably with my California and I have Brazil around here somewhere kind of a mess it's still a mess in my shop I'm still you know I try to clean it up and still kind of make the show at the same time which is a little bit difficult I wanted to give a shout out to Jack hey Jack it was nice meeting you jack is a fan of the show and he came over and met me the other day and he gave me this while he was here do you know what that is that is not a map of Virginia what that is or what or West Virginia it's a it's a Center finder you ever see one of these it's just two dolls and it's got a nail in it so say if you wanted to find the center of this this board here you would just take it twist it and then you could just mark it down that way and it finds the center assuming you didn't know that that plywood in the center was the center but on other boards it would work out really cool that that was cool and it was really it was really pleasure to meet you jack oh and I got this a while back and I forgot to mention this this is from Marlon Givens in Pennsylvania and he sent me this picture after it looks like my shut the box game remember but they it's a little bit different and he gave me instructions on how to play this and they just call it the game the game I like making games that was nice and like I said it's always fun to get stuff in the actual mail mail you guys write for football this weekend this is a great football weekend it's 12:15 now that means in a little over an hour the first playoff game starts so there's two playoff games today and then two tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be the good one in San Francisco is playing and I'm sure they'll win but my guess is that the Super Bowl is gonna come down to I'm just gonna I'm gonna make a prediction here it's going to be Denver I think Denver's gonna be in hands down easy it's just a matter who's gonna play Denver and I think it's gonna be Seattle I'd like for it to be San Francisco but I think it's gonna be Seattle and if it were San Francisco I just hope it's not the same clobbering San Francisco took from Denver and when they played in the Super Bowl the last time Winter Olympics are this year too and I always always enjoy watching the Olympics whether it's the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics and I really enjoyed curling curling is something I always want to play when I see it play it's like it looks like bowling on ice and it just looks like so much fun but we don't have any curling I did a search on the internet during the last Olympics four years ago because I got really excited about curling and I think the closest one there might have been a place down in San Jose I don't think there's an e anymore it's mainly it's a Canadian game I guess so I kind of wish see there's a good reason to move to Canada to play some curling did you enjoy the palette project yesterday I had a lot of fun making that project I really like the way it turned out I really it was a project that I wasn't expecting it to look as cool I I think as it turned out to look the the nail holes and everything and they're all just kind of came together and I thought it was a pretty cool project I've done a little bit of research on bathroom cabinets and what might work and that one most of them stick out farther if you want to put towels on but I didn't want to stick that our bathroom it's pretty small that's our guest bathroom and I didn't want to hit it all the time so it's a little bit narrower but the nice thing about those pallet projects is that you can really just you have to kind of modify them according to the wood you have because the the planks are the slats that the pallets are made out of just seem to be all over the place as far as widths there's some that are three and a half inches wide all the way up to four and a half inches wide they're different thicknesses so it's actually kind of fun to just go through those boards and just try to pick out mix and match as it were still think I got a couple more storage projects for this month I think next week I'm just I'm just brainstorming here brainstorming that I'm gonna do an under the bed storage box next week it's kind of one of these things that and I was mentioning this to Jack when he was over here the other day about how much of woodworking is just well it's making boxes everything I make is just a box really and you know the my bathroom cabinet was a box and my storage cabinet over here was a box if you can master the art of making a box then you can pretty much build anything you can make a house I'm thinking about making the under the bed storage you know I'd liked it for it to be on wheels but I don't want the wheels to really stick up high so they've got to go on the side don't want the box to be heavy so I'm gonna use some I think thinner plywood if I can't it's the kind of thing that doesn't get used a lot you know so those are all considerations that are going into this and then I want to try to do something a little bit different with it rather than just well make a box I mentioned the dowel of poo in my audible commercial I did yesterday this is really a good book I really enjoyed it's a short book it's easy to listen to or read if you want to actually read the book this isn't a plug they're not paying me for this part I'm just kind of doing this because I enjoyed a lot of these books and I did read The Hunger Games because I liked the movie so much and so I read the book I listened to the book when I say I read I don't read I listen but I listened to the Hunger Games and I'm not sure if it really added anything that the movie didn't already have so don't know it was pretty close to the movie you know a little bit difference here and there but I enjoyed it and I think I may read the next one the Catching Fire because I did like the the movie Catching Fire I'm still really into frozen it's funny to see all the people from all walks of life who are just discovering this film it's really kind of a phenomenon and I don't know what it is about that movie that just kind of strikes the right note and the music is really good and now I've seen it twice already I'm really looking forward to when it comes out on DVD and if you saw yesterday's video you'll know that I used my router as a jointer that's because I said well I don't really need a jointer I guess I don't need to join her because I was able to use the router so there and to be honest if I buy a couple of boards at the lumberyard or you know a home center and I need to make a panel and glue the edges together I don't usually bother jointing them at all usually you know the store-bought edges are pretty close or I can just run it through my table saw and that pretty much flattens them out and then just clamp them down really tight just has squish em together and that seems to work out fine for most stuff but the pallet wood is just right it's so gnarly it really needed a flat edge so I could get a good gluing surface on it there's my thoughts on joining jointer in joining jointer why is it called a jointer it should be a jointer right jointer I'm always confused by that jointer there's a biscuit joiner is it a biscuit jointer or biscuit joiner somebody's got their leaf blower running I guess that means it's time for me to end this video I will talk to you guys later bye well that was strange I just had a visit from another fan Michael Coolidge and he brought me this this is a wine bottle you know you put this over a white I had to ask him what it was and then I remember seeing these before you put this over a wine bottle like that not a finger and then in these little slots here you hang wine glasses so you know it's a decorative thing I guess and if you're gonna give somebody a bottle of wine many ways it's a it's a cool idea I think so thanks Michael was nice meeting you it's been a busy shop this week", "Ybjyb1eT1Nk": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do

"j6V9glgJiwo": "hey guys it's reminyl this is the another tutorial video of synthesis a girl from attack on Titan and we are going to use nine chords in the song the G C sharp C minor D sharp and the last chord G sharp that's it this song consists of intro verse pre-chorus and chorus part we are going to start from first one and then after that pre-chorus and then after that chorus and the last part is going to be intro because the intro is really difficult even me so we are going to start from verse 1 in the first part we are going to use F sharp minor D G C sharp and then a minor D minor a sharp e the strumming pattern of this song is going to be down don't look down all the time until the end from the start to the end so let's play along with this course with our F sharp minor D G C sharp E minor F in Oh No a minor E minor a job e ok and down down down start from F sharp minor and it's going to be like this [Music] [Music] in this part the code is going to be it's not gonna be a and again F sharp minor D from until [Music] [Music] which I know he does naca oh the heat ominous aura to your meta the order of the coal it's going to be a minor F G C and then after a minor SG e you know cold it won't be F G C a minor D yeah and it's gonna be like this [Music] okay let's box this together I'll go more floor than this [Music] let's sing along with these course all for the sake of you know the song when you sing you spot the chord you need or F G C F G C it's like this [Music] [Music] quality nominee FG c SG e [Music] [Music] [Music] we know you sold an Akita here ok ok this part it's the core it's going to be C - C sharp G sharp d sharp and then right after that C - D sharp G sharp C my example [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's eat ro intro is going to be like this how can I play the intro part I tried many ways but I think this is the best way to do the intro part yeah and but this is not easy as you can see I practiced a lot like so many times like more than 100 or even maybe 1000 but even now I cannot play better so you just need to practice Oh every day every day this yes in the first place you need to place your index finger on the 5th fret and then place your ring finger on 7th fret in here in here any place will ring na na pinky finger on 8th fret which is the next to the ring finger here and this is the basic form of your health in the intro so the first step you need to put your index finger on 3rd strings on the 5th fret and pluck your 3rd strings only one third strings right after you plug your plug the third strings on the 5th fret you need to place your ring finger on 4th strings on the 7th fret in here here here and then plug the fourth strings so at this point you're placing your fingers on fifth fret on the 3rd strings with your index finger and four strings on the seventh fret with your ring finger like this and you need to plug the strings on 3rd and both strings like this and right after you plug the 4th strings you need to play so pinky finger on the next fret which is eighth fret which is next to the ring finger on the fourth fret fourth string like here here here yes so right now you are placing your 3 fingers on 5th fret 7th fret 8th fret like this and all you need to plug it's just 3rd and 4th fret here so it's gonna be like this and after you pluck the 4th string on the eighth fret you need to move your index finger under the third string in here from the top yeah let's play again yes ok and then the last melody place your finger place your ring finger again and the 4th string 7th fret in here yeah from the top [Music] so let's play this fingerstyle repeat it be until I say stop 1 2 3 4 the right after you have finished your finger style you need to move your hand in here and from your hand on a minor you need to put your pinky finger on 4th fret 2nd strings in here here just put here and strum again when you place a pinky finger on 2nd strings 4 thread you can skip stay your middle finger on the 2nd fret 1st string so you don't need to move this finger just put the pinky finger on both strings no no 2nd strings [Music] after you place your pinky finger on the second string or thread you need to form your hand into F chord you need to form your hand into it's really difficult part but you have to practice again and again over and over again I practice a lot but even though it's not perfect so I need to practice again see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "bRHPMoMCfXw": "hello during the quarantine i had the pleasure to play outer wilds um and i was just uh really impacted by this uh game it's a brilliant game if you haven't played it yet go play it after i was finished i wanted to learn the traveler's theme and the composer for ottawa's was kind enough to put up a tutorial for how to play it on banjo which is the instrument that rybeck plays in the game but i don't have a banjo i have a 20 amazon ukulele so i wanted to learn it on that instrument and i was able to pick out the notes for myself so i wanted to share with you how to do it now i'm by no means a super skilled ukulele player so if i can do it you can do it and let me show you how i play it so first of all here's the tune in [Music] question [Music] and then it loops so there are kind of four sections to it um and they're all very similar to each other so it's pretty easy to uh pick up but what we're going to do we're only going to play the uh the last three strings the first string is not going to be used at all so we'll start on the second fret of the second string jump down to the third fret and the third string then we're gonna play the seventh fret we should be marked with the dot for you still on the third string back down to the third [Music] then we're gonna go to the third string on the fourth third fret on the fourth string [Music] so that's the first section then we're going to go back to the second string and play a very similar pattern this is where it differs we're gonna go back to the first string i'm sorry the fourth string second fret fifth back down to the second then rather than going back up to the second string like we would the last two sections we're going to play open on the third [Music] string then we're back to the second string [Music] so it's not difficult at all let's run through it again slowly [Music] foreign [Music] it's pretty easy now when you pull up the uh the actual soundtrack and try to play along um it's quite a bit faster than that but with practice um it's not too hard to keep up and the good news is that since ryback's playing the same thing if you miss a note maybe whoever's listening to you won't be able to tell and that's all i have today i hope that you enjoy it spread the word on how

how it is with bands and often bands break up I've been in bands that broke up I was in a band for a very long time and alas we broke up looks like any kind of the relationship you know you got more than one person involved gets difficult emotions run rampant everybody wants to go a different direction there's different ways people want to go in their lives different people different things people want to do artistically and how they want express themselves through their art different ways that everybody wants the musical direction to go some people might think that John was gonna rock

podcast that's exactly what he did he just like it has his little microphone set up on his [ __ ] African woodblock set and he just hits record and he just goes for like 70 minutes and there's then there's the album that's the [ __ ] album y'all what was that oh [ __ ] I'm pulling on a cord here I don't think yeah y'all in hearing that that's just that's just my headphone cable that was being wriggled at the time that's the professional term my headphone cable with being wriggled so uh no more wriggling no more jiggling and no more msconfig yelling so uh yeah it's been about a month y'all I'm about a month since I did my last podcast I believe this will be the first day of the new year so I'm gonna try y'all I know that I've said this many times I know that I'm the boy who cried I'm gonna do a podcast every week and at this point it's been way more than three times which I think is how many times the boy who cried wolf if you're not familiar with the boy who cried wolf there was a boy he was some kind of like Shepard I think he was like the GART the son of a shepherd or the nephew of a shepherd and just for fun he ran you know he was supposed to look out and make sure that there was no wolves in the distance and just to be a dick just for a prank or whatever you know he would just come running and say wolf wolf and everybody would [ __ ] run in terror and I lo and behold I guess he would start laughing I'm making up some of this story but he would start laughing and hahaha I fooled you look at my good acting I made you believe that there was a wolf in the distance or you know just omnipresent is that even how many president is like how God is but like maybe he was referring to that but he's saying the wolf was present nearby and everybody was in imminent danger and then he did it again same thing everybody runs everybody takes their well however sheep many sheep they can grab under their arm hoping that the wolf won't rip into the flesh and wool of the Sheep and he does it again he starts laughing he thinks he's like a little prankster and of course what happens the third time is when something happens in all jokes and all parables he actually does see a wolf and he comes running into town or the [ __ ] sheep herding land whatever they whatever whatever it was you know you could make a modern version of this too you could put it in in the city and you know a [ __ ] like the gang leader is coming or whatever it is you could make so many versions of the boy who cried wolf but the third time he actually did see a wolf and everybody gets eaten and everybody dies and I don't know why I started talking about why cried wolf why did I start talking about that oh man yeah okay I started talking about that because I'm saying that I'm gonna do a podcast every week and that is because I'm trying to step my game up I'm generally trying to step my game up in life the past few months I'm just gonna be I'm just gonna you know I'm gonna keep real honest you know I'm saying I'm just gonna tell you all the truth you know the past few months mainly the past like two and a half or so months before before January 2nd on January 2nd I guess today's like day five or so I haven't haven't had a cigarette I haven't had a beer haven't had a drop of alcohol you guys have been listeners podcast for a while know that I do these little stints where I don't I don't drink and I try to get healthy for some reason I don't have the ability to do anything in moderation and either has to be all or nothing I don't know why that is but that's how I am and I've learned I did 30 days then I did a hundred days and now I'm gonna try to do an entire year and I honestly honestly y'all if this year goes well I might just might just have to like I might just have to admit to myself that things go better for me and I'm a happier person when I don't drink I know that sounds [ __ ] insane to some of you and I get it because I absolutely with all my [ __ ] heart and soul with all my heart and soul there's nothing I love more then like going to a barbecue having some beers enjoying conversation with your friends and just having a good time and I think alcohol is a great assistant in that and I think it's a can provide many fun situations but what happens to some people you get older and then it becomes really only one out of every tour you know I don't know how many times but like you know some of you guys out there like when you drink you're with people and you're having a good time with your friends and as for some of us when we get older it becomes like you know you actually end up drinking a lot more per like in general and like per drinking session when you're by yourself and if you live kind of a lonely type of life like I do for some reason and I think that the reason that one of those reasons is because of this note alcohol thing it just gets worse and worse and it kind of makes you depressed and it kind of can result in kind of making you miserable to a certain extent and the past couple months granted I have my studio and I have like during the day I'll come in and work and it's good I'm making some music and I'm making some good music and you know I got I got times where I go and I do do my [ __ ] i hang out my family but you know like most pretty much every night I kind of I kind of [ __ ] just like live in this little miserable world alone and I know that sounds emo or whatever but it is what it is you know I mean I just the last two months I've just been extremely self-destructive I just kind of let myself just deteriorate into whatever like all the working out I did was for not all the sobriety was for not and this is what happens every time I try I do one of these quitting for a little while things as I get myself to this point where everything is ridiculous and it's kind of hard to explain because I'm not one of those alcoholics you hear about and read about that like I got to wake up in the morning and [ __ ] and drink hand sanitizer and mount him a whole bottle of mouthwash and nyquil and and [ __ ] like that like that like you know I'm not like one of those people I can I don't have to drink in the morning but like and once I start to let myself drink you know I can I'm one of those people who when I start I can't stop like if I get a six-pack from the store you know that might be okay if I just uh might one my little like if I just did a hundred days not drinking for a couple weeks I might be able to just drink a six-pack every night but then after a while like once you get them six in you you can't Han you can't help but find a way to get more and then it becomes 12 it becomes more than 12 and then that's just not good for your body it's not good for your soul it's not good for anything because you know eventually it starts cutting into your next day you know you're staying up late getting ridiculously drunk by yourself and then you wake up late you don't feel like doing anything because you're hungover and you also don't feel like getting up because you're depressed and that's where I was at that's just now so I'm just laying it all out there of me I'm trying to change this year the good thing is hmm the good thing is if there's something there's I don't know there's some maybe there's I have this weird I have this weird thing inside me where I kind of like to torture myself and when I say that what I mean is like when I go a hundred days like last year I 100 days I didn't drink I didn't smoke I [ __ ] worked out every day and I what's the other element oh yeah like I was eating mad healthy and to a certain extent that [ __ ] is like torture - like you're not allowing yourself anything so for some reason I had to be all or nothing and uh I'm pretty confident that I can do it like I'm not I'm not like I'm not like totally tripping even though for the last couple days I think I had I definitely had some like withdrawal symptoms expanding and it was especially worse because I happen to also have like a flu-like cold I don't think it was the flu but I was like flu-like symptoms because I was around my brother's kids and they are [ __ ] coughing all over me and I got a I just got straight-up sick and I think that that combined with some like alcohol and cigarette withdrawal and so for the past since since New Year's basically I've just been I'm been just physically sick but you know today I'm feeling a lot better and uh still been working still been working and got my studio still managed to get in here you know I can still drink here and you know all that stuff and like some reason like when it comes to making beats and [ __ ] like you know lack of sobriety doesn't necessarily affect that too much to be honest with you you know I've been doing this [ __ ] I've been doing this [ __ ] for years now so I'm used to it and you know basically my goal my resolutions for this year are so [ __ ] numerous like take any stereotypical New Year's resolution whether it be get in shape eat healthy work out stop smoking stop drinking all that stuff like I'm doing every single one of those things so it's kind of kind of crazy but uh I'm ready for it man that's what you know I consider this [ __ ] like an experiment like I want to see if this [ __ ] makes me happy I want to see if this [ __ ] makes me like more successful I guess like what makes my career go better cuz I don't know if any guys have been paying attention like I didn't like last year was not really a good year for me it was an interesting year was it like hurting on a personal level it was like a rebuilding year on a personal level it was cool I learned a lot about myself but as far as my career I don't think I did one music video I don't think I put out but maybe one one or maybe maybe one song in [ __ ] 365 days so it was a kind of a [ __ ] year for me as far as my career I mean I did do the Warped Tour I did do some like shows and [ __ ] but yeah I don't know it just wasn't I just wasn't there really and it was it was strange I don't know how to describe it but I'm trying to see if I if I can switch my [ __ ] and I will I'll definitely be putting out music this year just because I've been working so much but we'll uh we'll see what happens when I'm gonna try to just regain my whole sense of confidence and bishan and really just like you know when when you get to I think you just get to a point where you just don't really like care about yourself you know and I definitely kind of have gotten to that point in my life multiple times and there's been spurts where I go go the other way and I go hard and I'm motivated I'm dedicated and that's where I always do the best and that's where I'm always the most happy so I'm hoping that this year will be one of those years and the only way I can do that is to like [ __ ] make some kind of internal change and uh and hopefully it I just become a better more confident more happy person you know cuz I'm unfortunately you know even though I [ __ ] joke around on this podcast and I talk a lot of [ __ ] and you know I'm a pleasant dude to be around and I'm you know I don't I'm not I'm not to kind of do it you know sometimes in my music I do but I'm not to kind of do it to like usually like just [ __ ] when I get around my friends and get around anybody I don't tell them about how like how my life is going internally you know I'm Sam but you know I'm like I'm just kind of a [ __ ] up dude sometimes you know I'm saying in the last couple months have been really [ __ ] up for me and that's probably why I didn't do the podcast a lot just you know I just been [ __ ] up so trying to change that this year starting with this podcast and I'm gonna hope hopefully do it every Wednesday Mike's podcast like the original theme had stated so yeah enough of that [ __ ] I don't really have much to talk about I have been making music like I said I did write down a couple things I mean I've been I should have some I mean I've been gone from the podcast for a damn near a month I did do stuff the whole holiday season happened before I get into anything that I wanted I wanted to I wanted to give a big up to my boy Jason H Jason H well he you know I gotta say his full name Jason Hidalgo Jason and augo runs kettlebells Southbank there was a couple when I was healthy last year before before the last couple of woods I was working out with this dude and it's in Torrance he owns his own gym now so congratulations to him man to own your own business is a really beautiful thing and he owned his own gym and this is where I would go to work out last year and he's [ __ ] awesome it's [ __ ] affordable and it feels really good like if you like to workout and you live in South Bay or you live anywhere like even Venice it's close to Venice where I used to live give him a shout-out man I don't have a [ __ ] really have a proper contact that kind of was a fail but if you he's on Yelp kettle bells South Bay it's called kettle bells South Bay or I'll pay kettlebells I don't think that there's any any other places gonna pop up so shout out to him follow him on Twitter Jason I mean on instagram jason dot Hidalgo hid al geo I want to give him a shout-out because I never did and he was the man and the reason that I even started going there cuz he listened to wax his podcast so uh Big Ups all right the only other thing I have written down and this study that and this thing we're from like three weeks ago this is kind of a weird transition but I was read it for a little bit anyway it says pit bull didn't sell out he found himself that was it I was me and my brother were having a conversation about just like we have all kinds of conversation about music and like what's going on in the world of music and what used to go on the world of music whether it's hip hop or like industry executives or rock-and-roll or [ __ ] music sales and Spotify and how things are going on blah blah blah you know sorry I'm sipping coffee and I'm sipping it walk through one of those you know I get to go cup with the little holes so it's kind of still hot so you're gonna hear sound like this good ass coffee damn yeah that conversation we were talking about just selling out and like what the definition of selling out is and then we just got I wish that I could I wish that I could take callers or I wish that I had like a you know I like a Google hangout or Ustream type of situation where people could kind of chat in right now because I'd be interested getting in getting you guys opinion on this he was saying that pitbull didn't sell out he found himself like if you've ever seen pitbulls behind the music or just knew of pitbull when he first kind of started to rap he was like a battle rapper he was like a you know he wore jerseys big bit I mean everybody wore big [ __ ] in jerseys back then but you know when he first came out he like he literally was it like doing like street battles gangs what Miami kind of like he's called pitbull cuz he bite my [ __ ] heads off that's what and he was known for being really good at it too and uh you know some people would argue that yo he should have stayed like that man he was pitbull what happened man he sold out you know what I mean but if you think about it like there's a lot of people that do this [ __ ] the pitbull used to do there's a lot of rappers mm-hmm I mean Jesus especially now said that battle rap I know it's a whole different thing now like with the acapella spoken word type of battle rapping but um but yeah like how can you really say sold out because everybody does that like selling out is kind of like doing what everybody else does and I don't think there's anybody else that that does what pitbull does like granted there's been rappers addressing suits granted there's been rappers it kind of like keep it classy and do pop music and you know wear jewelry and make dance music but like to do a pitbull does like there's really only one dude that does with pitbull does and if you ever traveled and traveled internationally you can see that like that dude is just like eat what he says he's mr. international he's not just saying that [ __ ] like he really is like probably the biggest rapper in the world people in the United States might not know that but I'm pretty sure that pitbull is the biggest rapper in the world he definitely has the biggest songs in the world out of any rappers if you add up like just international ship ah yeah I don't know why you know I didn't really I just that just was written down so ponder that did pitbull sell out and you can ask that you can ask that about a lot of different people you know somebody had said I think that I might have read this in a previous podcast I did like maybe it was the last one but you know just to bring it back up because that cuz I had a conversation with one of my friends who was really like strangely he was like strangely upset by Kendricks song I like strangely upset that [ __ ] [ __ ] is so goddamn corny blah blah blah and I think one of the reason he was said he's is because he's a big fan and he liked the way that Kendrick used to do a [ __ ] on an old album but first of all that's it's one it's one song first of all second of all it's just that [ __ ] Isley Brothers who's that lady with the dude rappin I don't see what's so sellout about that if anything that's some classic hip-hop [ __ ] taking a Isley Brothers sample and rapping over it that's [ __ ] today was a good day you know so uh yeah you know everybody has their own definition of sellout and even more even more and my brain is moving were they weird what's the word subjective even more subjective than that is the definition of the word corny like the word corny like it's just so different to everybody else you know what you can Scott I'm sorry I'm being all jumbly let me explain first of all that I know through experience of doing these sober things like the first like week or two that you do it especially if you're like X goddamn like if especially if you're really coming off of like a super a super brain brain soaked alcohol binge and I think that if this is let me let me start from the top here like let's say the last month every day not only did I [ __ ] drink a ridiculous amount of alcohol but also like I didn't give a [ __ ] about what I was eating either like I was eating mad like [ __ ] food Philly cheesesteak type [ __ ] you know I'm saying I know I hate on Philly cheesesteaks y'all but I found a [ __ ] good ass there's a good ass Philly cheesesteak restaurant on my new neighborhood I'm not gonna front a joint is so good but that being said it's bet like you know how come I can't get get that [ __ ] in Philly you know I mean how come I got to go to [ __ ] North Hollywood California to get a decent cheesecake cheesecake cheesesteak every time I go to Philly to get one it tastes like goddamn the most bland [ __ ] I've ever [ __ ] had step your game up Philadelphia but I've been just eating [ __ ] food and just everything is like you know if you think about what beer is it's just like I've been consuming tons of like carbs and sugar you know and then when I when I for some reason I always take it all away not only do I take alcohol away not only do I take all the other [ __ ] that's in beer away but I also kind of immediately gone like a low carb low sugar thing and I and you know I'm trying to get my body tight too you know I'm saying I'm trying to like I'm trying to get back in shape you know and I've had this experience I've had this experience every time I've done this like the first week or two like I just can't really think or talk straight for a while like like my brain like my whole body goes through like this chemical I feel like it's like I feel like it's literally like a chemical thing like my body's like where where's all the sugar and carbs and [ __ ] like that's just confused and you get it's almost like you're a girl on her period you have like little weird mood you're Moody and [ __ ] you can't string thoughts together you know I'm saying so it's kind of sorry if this podcast sounds specifically jumbled II you know I'm saying but uh yeah it's weird it's a weird it's it's physical and mental you just you just feel strange you know but you get over after a while and you just gotta you just gotta stick through it you know what I mean you get cravings and so it's really [ __ ] weird like if you're if you drink a shitload of beer and maybe this has to do with the food too but if you think of it like the way that I drink beer if you think about like how much I like it's like eating a goddamn loaf of bread every night but like I get cravings for [ __ ] like ice cream you know every single time Lincoln like the first week like every night I'm just like if I can't drink I want to like go get a milkshake or something like that which is some [ __ ] that I don't do you know and I never drink milkshakes or eat ice cream or get a Snickers bar or anything like that but like get weird cravings so I think that I think that sugar is a big part of uh I don't know [ __ ] about the human body I don't know anything about how how it works how we run but um I know that sugar is a big part of it y'all and I know because people were diabetic and you know that's all about sugar you know am i right yeah just like this guy's [ __ ] idiot y'all are probably listening this podcast like man you should stop maybe you shouldn't do a podcast every week yeah so I don't know that's where that's where I'm at right now you know I'm saying dang all gonna be perfect but that's where I'm at let me uh pause this for a second all right I'm back let's get into some shoutouts and some questions shoutouts for this week and I'll let you know I think as far as my email which by the way beats four whacks at gmail.com ve ATS fo RW ax at gmail.com if you want to send a podcast email I caught up a little bit about a month back so if you send me an email it probably takes me about a month to actually read it sometimes if I fall off it takes me about two months to read it I always respond if you're even you know if you email me I'll always give you a shout-out if I like the question enough or if I just think it's an interesting question I'll read it on the podcast by the way C this is another way that I fail y'all you know what I didn't do in the in the I have a thing on my website if you go to wax Kham Kham w ax do TCO m dot c om and click on podcasts there's a link there it takes you to amazon.com and if you go to amazon.com via that link and buy something on there I actually get like a very very small percentage of it I just don't use it myself it goes my I give it to my brother so he can buy [ __ ] diapers first kids and stuff like that I think I've made five dollars or something I don't even know what it is I don't look at it but something very small I made off of it but uh of course during the holiday season when it's most busy and people use Amazon most I did not do my podcast and even the one I did I didn't even mention that I could have that [ __ ] so I'm not much of a businessman but um maybe got some Christmas money maybe got a check from your mom my grandma from your Aunt Rachel your uncle fastball maybe you know if you want to use Amazon talking about it you could do it that way but um sorry for making that noise with my nostrils into the microphone dude I am [ __ ] really like scatterbrained right now alright shoutouts for this week Devon are at the University of Toronto thanks for that email man I appreciate that Eddie Zillah at macabre and calm you guys should check them out I think I mentioned them before it's MC al b ra and e.com that's music culture art life is what McCall stands for Sam C in Manchester shout out to you Tim the guitar student from Canada he just said Canada so don't think that he said some specific [ __ ] like he was like man [ __ ] like he just said Canada you know I think people in Canada think that if we see a Canadian place we're just like Oh Canada you know like it's all one thing like there's no difference between [ __ ] it's only a thousands and thousands of miles from Vancouver to Nova Scotia but you know it's two of any American that [ __ ] is the same city ah Joseph R Michael from North Haven Maine big Rob who recommends podcast merch such as be safe out there shirts I'll think about that big Rob I don't think I deserve to sell those yet I got to get make sure I think if I if I can do the podcast every week for the next three months I think maybe I deserve to sell podcast shirts Ryan G Kendall from Houston good at studios podcasts out to y'all you guys are the [ __ ] grant C ad from Chicago what up Edie Brandon from Connecticut what the [ __ ] man this place is not [ __ ] soundproof hold up so there's a there stood shooting up there shooting a music video like a like right outside the door in my studio and it's a Kristen one I gotta be quiet I don't think I'm think I'm dissing Oh so right here I put my microphone kind of right by the door and try to capture some behind-the-scenes of this music video the director kind of sounded like Vince Vaughn so there you have it my studio is really not that soundproof and there's a dude shooting a Christian Christian rap video right outside the door that's the door that goes out to the outside it doesn't seem like that BA doesn't seem like it'd be the greatest backdrop for a Christian rap video it's just this like it looks like a storefront essentially but hey props to him man I get it I get it man you had trouble used to rap and used to gangbang and now you found God you found the Bible I mean you know there's a certain sense of jealousy that us heathens have towards like actual faith real unadulterated faith in your [ __ ] flesh bones soul heart and brain that that book is right and if you do the right thing you're gonna go to this beautiful place which I've never understood by the way cuz how can it be beautiful if you can't send there that doesn't make any sense to me or can you sin I don't know how can it be heaven if you can't like I don't know maybe that just proves that I'm [ __ ] up but I get it I wouldn't you know there's a jealousy that some some of us have towards you believers out there and now you're rapping I hear and I hear in his verses he's talking about how his life is changed and he feels great and he realizes that his life was a blessing I can't I can't say that I'm not jealous of that so props to you I'm gonna have to actually edit some of that and see if you can even [ __ ] hear what they were talking about maybe I can't man I tried to stick the mic to the door so you could get it hear the lyrics and hear the guy direct and I'ma [ __ ] cuz it's funny because the guy directing him is just a guy that [ __ ] works down the hall he's kind of a jack-of-all-trades and it's great that when he's directing at the end he's just hopefully I can hopefully you guys can hear that I don't know I'll edit it afterwards the first ipod has actually had the [ __ ] edit goddammit but uh he's all cussing every other word to the Christian rapper he's working with ya dude out in the hall like a jack-of-all-trades he's always just shooting shooting stuff and editing stuff you know this little camera whatnot but let's get back to the shoutouts and questions alright I don't remember which person I stopped at so I know that I said Big Rob who recommended the podcast March so I I got that from Chicago I got I think I stopped at Brandon from Brandon from Connecticut benkei Aaron James at Aaron James draws calm aaro n J AME s DRA WS calm he is a podcast listener and he is an amazing artist you should go to his website for real he does comics or cartoons I don't know exactly which one you would call that I get those confused but it's definitely Stephanie Comics but it's both his cartoons and there's form of comics I don't know her cartoons the ones that move is that what makes it a cartoon I don't know but they're [ __ ] Titus [ __ ] and he does these custom guitars he paints guitars and it looks amazing and I recommend you take it at least a quick look at his website if not a long extended look at his website and last but not least shout-out to the homegirl Randy Elizabeth in Arizona one of the only people that I will look at the snapchat like I have a snapchat I'm not telling you what it is if you don't already know because every dude that sends me snapchats is the worst then and I think that since I don't respond anyway that that even when I first got one and actually announced what it was like all the dudes that would like take a bong hit and say like dude I'm kind of good on that so I'm kind of dumb with snapchat except for the couple people actually look at this [ __ ] I never respond to anybody like what am I going to send you a picture on my balls like I don't do that mm all right let's do some questions I don't know do you want a picture of my balls huh hey what's up wax I'm Mike from Switzerland I just want to say I love your podcasts for me it's very funny to listen to you and entertains me on the way to work and everyday in my car thanks for that bro I also use it to quote unquote learn English it's great for me because it's real English when you know what I mean I'm reading like all the he that he doesn't know perfect English I like to read people's when they don't interpreting perfect English I also use it to learn English it's great for me because it's real English when you know what I mean like I'd say I love your pod like I'd say I love your podcast but I really don't know your music yet except rosana that was a huge summer hit here in Switzerland so I went to your home page and the first thing I saw was the song feels good i fund it pretty dope so I decided to buy your album today I don't listen yet but I will do it tomorrow hey man I appreciate that Mike to fit the the fact that you learn English through this podcast is [ __ ] amazing to me first of all and second of all I know I've known some people that English wasn't their first language like I mean even dumb Jonathan Park okay dumbfounded aka Parker who will be returning to battling by the way if y'all didn't know that he's gonna be battling in February in Toronto so I'm excited about that he learned English from like television like he would learn from like married with children and the Simpsons and [ __ ] like that and I think even older TV shows too but uh yeah it there is a thing too like you know in like for us for Americans I took Spanish in high school and my brother took Spanish in high school but when my brother got to college he actually majored in Spanish in college and did a semester in Mexico and he said when he went to Mexico like he realized it like this the Spanish we learned is like the [ __ ] proper Spanish obviously and like you you learn a lot of the cool [ __ ] there and you can learn to be a little bit more of a native speaker and yeah I'm sure that I use some type of slang if not just [ __ ] that's not grammatically correct that people use all the time anyway English is actually really [ __ ] up language if you think about there's a lot of rules that never follow it to the to the code you know you might not realize if that if you're in a native English speaker but you know I think I brought it up on the podcast before but just think about if you know Spanish like if something is spelled a certain way in Spanish and you look at it you can pronounce it correctly because it is what it's pronounced how it's spelled but if you think about certain things in English like if you think of the the Oh ugh OH ugh is all you have to think about there's like ten different ways to say that you can say enough you can say bought you can say bow like a bow on a tree there's way there's way more than that alright fought there's way [ __ ] now of course I'm not even drought that's something that is that the same thing that I say drought yet there's a drought enough though even though thought I had a thought you know even that that's through yeah come through that's six ways right there oh they're all oh ugh ooh oh you know the [ __ ] I'm saying other languages don't necessarily do that so I appreciate it Mike I got some questions do you have many nicknames what is your favorite one and which one do you hate the most I don't have many nicknames by Nick my name is Michael people that have known me for a long time you call me Mike I have a dumb nickname that some people in San Diego call me Micah some people call me Micah and then most people will call me wax then you know like my mom doesn't call me that [ __ ] my mom calls me Michael he's having a chick they would call me Mikey sometimes girls call me Mikey you know cuz they like they'd like to be tall pettish you know pet pet name e you know I'm saying I don't have any other nicknames that I can think of all right who you think is the best upcoming rapper right now upcoming I guess Kendrick is no longer upcoming who was the [ __ ] guy was there was this somebody I was impressed by recently that I really liked his chance the rapper so upcoming he's really good who was the person I just recently listen to somebody who I was really [ __ ] I really liked damnit damnit that's gonna piss me off who was that somebody there's somebody that somebody's really good there is somebody new who's really good I don't know man I'll just go with Kendrick and say that he's upcoming because you know he's not any like he's jay-z you know I mean which rappers your favorite one all-time I don't really have a favorite rapper of all time if I had to say that you know I like just I might pick a different one every day if I had to say right now maybe Devin Devin the dude I like too short like jay-z you know he's got to be considered the best right he's been around the longest without falling you know cuz a lot of rappers been around a long time I mean the only one who's been who's really had a career that long and still kind of maintained their [ __ ] is Snoop you know its new boobs actually been around longer than jay-z but but if we're talking about like skills as a rapper you kind of got to go with jay-z above snoop even though snoops like the ultimate and smooth and funky that's kind of tough and it depends that's all depends on taste but I gotta say that jay-z is the best of all time right I'd go out on a limb at this point and probably have to say if you if you said who's the best all-around hip-hop artist of all time I mean you kind of got to go with Kanye right how could you not just every album that he makes is amazing not only is it amazing but it's groundbreaking and then every time everything he does everybody a year later is trying to follow him and do what he's the [ __ ] he did I like people like that that's why I like Kendrick you know there's a lot of albums that they could come out now that sound like [ __ ] Kendrick ran you know and then Kanye's like that and then Drake took a little bit from people here and there but Drake is like that man that everything that you hear now sounds like a combination of Kendrick Kanye and you know I mean that's what you're hearing now on all these albums all right last year I start photographic last year I spoke last year I start with photographic I wonder what you say to my photos all right Mike well I mean let's let's discuss that sentence let's discuss that sentence before we get into that last year I start with photographic I wonder what you say to my photos you started with photography which is photographic but photography is what you started with and I wouldn't say something to your photos that'd be like as if you're like if I was gonna say something to your photos that would be as if your photo was like a was like a person who was listening you know like if I'm saying something to something god I never thought about this before but if you say something to something it implies that they're listening doesn't it I can say something about your photos I can say something to your friend about your photos that's weird I never thought about that if you're saying something you can't say I can't say something to this to the speaker I mean I can if I'm crazy but I can say something about the speaker you can only say something to something if if they're listening that's weird that would be so happy when you find time to check it so check out Mike's photos at flicker calm / photos / space 1 2 4 0 5 6 301 a 1002 / that's the actual thing this is this is a troll and this is a bunch of like little boys I'm [ __ ] stupid Oh oh you do like landscape and animal [ __ ] you [ __ ] took these pictures my pocket didn't take these pictures damn I mean these are beautiful pictures you're like a year are you you do like looks like some magazine [ __ ] alright well I said web address if you want to see he does some landscapes he does a lot of cars you like cars Mikey photography I see I see I see what you're doing out there you like the cars out there in Switzerland Switzerland by the way and I do believe I said this on my last podcast somebody asked me where I would move if I could move anywhere and I [ __ ] said Switzerland I think I said that on my last podcast if not it was on somebody else's podcast or we're just talking to a friend but I mean it's beautiful they're part of it is because it's very wealthy you know you don't kind of every most people in Switzerland at least I haven't you know a solid amount of money you know you don't see a lot of homeless PC any homeless people in Switzerland it's funny you know people in America who have never been to Europe with the exception of a few different cities London and Paris and even there it's nothing like LA or Detroit or DC like Chicago like there's not like you know most places in Europe you go to the urban area and there's just no homeless people part of unemployment in Germany part of unemployment is that you get a [ __ ] apartment a flat is what they would call it if you don't got a job they give you a [ __ ] salary and an apartment that's how they [ __ ] treat their people not Americans we're [ __ ] or we're not you know we think we think that were the best we think that capitalism is right we think every man for himself build yourself up by your bootstraps not everybody thinks that way some people think help your fellow man you know we just [ __ ] step on homeless people half of the homeless people out here [ __ ] really should be in a mental institution they literally cannot think for themselves or function in the real world and in other places that's what they do people are taken care of they're treated in a humane nature not here man not here okay yeah we're just trained to think that it's the best the best [ __ ] place and it is for some things you know don't get me wrong people come here all the time but but what you do not see what you do not see is uh that's weird I said not see that's we're not see yeah but whatever what you do not see is a [ __ ] influx of Swiss Swiss immigrants right now like oh god I must live in America it's the best country I must flee my impoverished terrible Swiss nation and go drive a cab in st. Louis you didn't you definitely do not see that from the Swiss you definitely do not see a bunch of Danish immigrants you don't really see an influx of Dutch or German or really anywhere in Europe you know I'm saying you know what the [ __ ] is my point I don't have any okay when you like it I would I would be great to put my name out Z ing g dot mi CH AE L on Flickr I guess that's the easier way to do it huh PS sorry for my bad english writing keep it up my man and be safe out there your boy from Switzerland peace out a mic man you made my [ __ ] day with this email man you're the goddamn man love your photography have fun in Switzerland hopefully I'll make it back out there if I don't just totally fail in life I don't know why I'm being so negative on this podcast but you're the goddamn man and I appreciate the [ __ ] email alright this next one's from Toni Z wax what's up man my name is Toni I'm 20 years old and I'm from Annapolis Maryland Knapp town and the place to be what's up I used to spend a lot of time in Annapolis I grew up like 20 minutes from there my question for the podcast is do you ever write a song a rap that you think is really good I'm wondering if it actually is or you just think that it is because you wrote it yeah this is classic I've written a few songs that I like a lot and I think that they could be really good but it's hard to tell if other people would [ __ ] with it I hope you take the time to read this man even if you don't read it on the podcast and email back would make my day stay positive keep doing what you're doing man maybe we can make a track together one day keep it real tone easy this here is the classic if you've never mmm if you're a musician songwriter producer whatever a great thing to watch look up the Smeezingtons the Smeezingtons is the production crew it's a three-man crew it's a kid named Ari a dude named Philip and Bruno Mars Philip Philip Lawrence and Bruno Mars and they do an interview with AZ cap and it's like a two-part interview it's a really really good watch and I recommend that to anybody if you go on YouTube and write this type the Smeezingtons interview I got imagine it's the first thing that pops up anyway they had a Bruno Mars address of this issue he like he says like just because you wrote it doesn't mean it's hot and that means that's not that's not me that's not you Tony the twenty-year-old that's [ __ ] Paul McCartney that's [ __ ] Kanye that's Bruno Mars whoever it is you have to know that just because you wrote it doesn't mean it's good and every musician suffers from that especially when they first start to get when they first start to make music when they first start to you know especially when they first start to get kind of good at it they start to think that they can do no wrong and uh I've been there I remember putting uh excuse me Jesus but uh remember my old band when before we were good I remember giving my giving like I'm ever like really really like going out of the way they put put our tapes places put our demo tapes places and like like if I were to listen to that today I'd just be like appalled you know you're always gonna get better and for some reason like if you can sound even like an inkling as good as like the music you like the music that influences you if you're even somewhere in the realm of sounding like that or or you know you think it's good and because you made it you have a natural affinity towards it it's just like you know when I was in high school I took two years of ceramics and it's just there's a my [ __ ] wasn't good I have no [ __ ] hand artistic skills I can't draw I can't paint I can't sculpt I can't do anything like that but you know it's almost like it's the same it's the same thing as like a mother thinking that everything your kid does is good you know I mean my [ __ ] my mom thought my ceramics was great but I know that I know though [ __ ] wasn't good but back then like you get this you get this inherent joy out of creation you know that's something that's built with I think that that's inherent in human beings as the desire to create whether it be creating another human being through sexual intercourse whether it be creating fire whether it be creating a hut for us to dwell in whether it be creating a beautiful piece of music it doesn't matter we have a desire to create and we get joy from it and there's something that I would feel when I would finish my little pot my little pottery and ceramics I'd be like yo this [ __ ] is super tight this thing that could be an ashtray a vase or a bong if you put holes in it in the right place this thing is awesome you know and if you put that [ __ ] in our art museum if you submitted it to the Louvre which is essentially what like like you know if you make your demo tape if it's like your first little demo and you submit it to [ __ ] Capitol Records god that's good ass analogy that's what that's like that's like me taking my pottery that I made in high school ceramics class putting that [ __ ] to the Louvre the high you know the highest level the highest level of art and saying yo you should display this you should give me a deal and you should display this that's the same [ __ ] as when you make your first demo and you send that [ __ ] to Capitol Records saying goddamn [ __ ] but people look at music differently once you make a couple things you start thinking about the way the lifestyle you start thinking about you just want to live the lifestyle you want to travel you want to get the girls you want to make the money and you enjoy making music so how hard could it be but you got to understand and once you grow older the better you get the better you get at making music it's strange the better you get to realize you realize that you're actually not that good you realize that people are better than you and you realize that you have a lot more to learn and the best people all know that that everything they make is not good you know even the greatest pops Reiter's the greatest you know people who are do musicals people who direct movies write screenplays they got duds man nobody bats a thousand but there's just you know there's just something inherent within us that has an affinity towards the things that we create ourselves and of course there's there's there's something you know in certain cases like like I always say for myself because you know that's that's the example that I know the best on my last album I had songs on there that I knew that maybe some people wouldn't like I knew that so maybe some people like it like a great example is who's what's your vice if you've never ever heard that song like I know that some people aren't gonna like [ __ ] bump that like the way they bump [ __ ] trap beat or something like that but either way I can be proud of that [ __ ] because I know that the [ __ ] [ __ ] I was saying on there is tight and I know that that shit's a representation of how I personally feel just the way they like a paint if you paint something and you you're representing how angry you are when you look at it you know that it's a representation of that whether a [ __ ] critic comes and says like that's a bad painting like you could just be like [ __ ] you as an awesome painting that's that's what I felt you know I mean so that's that's what's cool what's cool about music but like you know that part everybody has the right to their own opinion that's something you got to learn to if you're gonna be in this [ __ ] as everybody's gonna trash you and everybody's gonna dish you and if you get to a point where you actually allow where people are actually dissing you that actually probably means you're doing alright because usually people just don't give a [ __ ] to give you the time of day like I said you know I'm still a little sick so I'm suffering from congestion right now so yeah I hope that helps you Tony yeah there's definitely times when I write songs and raps I think is good and wonder if I didn't like them just because I wrote them but that but that was really more like a thing I did back in the day I feel like now I kind of have a handle on like you know what what I like of my own [ __ ] and what I don't you know I write [ __ ] suck sometimes usually I usually know that it sucks alright this one is from Danny hey wax this is Danny quote the Boeing engineer that hates his job unquote from Seattle I hope Boeing doesn't listen to wax his podcast because they really should they really should though they would learn a lot I'm a longtime listener of your podcast and very longtime follower / follower of your YouTube channel because if you know following did listen to the podcast they could be like alright search our Seattle office for people named Danny and then they could bring you guys in maybe there's 10 and then some people I mean there's 10 Daniels and then 5 of them are like nobody ever calls me Danny do it I'm Dan and then the other guys like doing I'm Daniel so the fiber occasionally called Danny are still standing there in line and then they're looking at you like which one of you [ __ ] listened to waxes podcast even sent an email they just said you hate your job it's just gonna be obvious by your face that you're the one alright anyway I'm a longtime listener of your podcast and very longtime follower of your YouTube channel I found out about you and the first Youtube cypher was going around put ashore you're my favorite rapper of all time wow man you dude see I gotta get I gotta get more [ __ ] out there man I got people who think I'm their favorite rapper of all time you see how amazing that is y'all I'm not trying to [ __ ] gas myself up I usually try to not read less praise and the thing but that's pretty amazing man Thank You Man alright but anyway to get to the point of this email I've recently started vaping which is basically using e-cigarettes I use 0 milligrams nicotine juice I have never smoked a cigarette in my entire life and I don't intend to my friend like let me take a hit from one of his vapes one night and I found the oral fixation very fulfilling either Danny I I got my own starter kit after doing a ton of research on the health risks and it and I did and found out that at this point in time there is none at this point in time you mean like in the 1920s when they said the same [ __ ] about cigarettes and it's very likely that there won't be any for from long-term use there's a huge subculture in vaping and after reading and watching a ton of YouTube videos I've become fascinated with it I wanted to know have you ever tried it I know you're a smoker and a lot of vapors have been able to quit smoked cigarettes with baby absolutely that's true a lot of people did that there are many benefits to it including it doesn't [ __ ] up your teeth and gums you don't smell like cigarettes or make other things smell like cigarettes it's way cheaper you can do it indoors since the vapors do not let out carcinogens yes but you're still are kind of douchey for doing that because people are annoyed by it and then all the other health related stuff like lung cancer and blah blah I didn't mean you specifically what I said douchey Danny I mean some people anyway you probably don't need me to tell you about health risks and all that since you're a grown man but maybe listeners of this podcast can try it out if they're looking to quit smoking I found that a lot of people haven't even seen an e cig in person so it's probably why they stick to the sticks but vape shops are generally run by very chill people and will let you try it out so you can be on your way to a healthier alternative just looking out I hope you come back to Seattle again caught you a few years ago at the crocodile and your performance was the opposite of boring take care and be safe out there PS if you don't agree to see me on the podcast you can at least give me a shot at it mean a lot to me Oh Danny shoutout to you thanks for the thanks for the email and as far as vaping my take on vaping is the following if you're putting water vapor in and out of your lungs continuously I feel like there's got to be some kind of health effect of that if you do that [ __ ] it's like if you it's like smoke like if you put if you blew smoke onto something and would like turn yellow after a while if you blew water vapor onto something it would mould so my theory with no medical evidence whatsoever is that after 50 years you can get long mould and people haven't been vaping for 50 years so they don't know that yet now they're gonna listen this podcast 50 years from now as everybody will because once I die it's gonna be a big thing this episode of this podcast will basically be the Mona Lisa yeah yeah I mean it says now that there's no long term [ __ ] from it but straight up in the 1920s and 30s like cigarettes were not known like people didn't say that cigarettes had effect like doctors would smoke cigarettes in the operating room and [ __ ] so everybody smoked but yeah I will agree I will agree that it's it's got to be better than cigarettes are for you it's got to be and I know a lot of people have quit with it and I'm sure I got a man it's way better and you can like you can like start with nicotine and go down a little bit after a while then go down a little bit then have none and you know you can still like enjoy it with your alcohol like some people do and you can do the [ __ ] indoors too although sometimes people take that [ __ ] too extreme like it's almost like they're trying to prove a point with that [ __ ] like at a restaurant it's like dude it's still like [ __ ] in the [ __ ] sky that's blowing in my face you know what I mean still got it still got your [ __ ] germs mixed with water vapor and it's not blowing into my [ __ ] face just because you think you can no offense to you Danny I'm talking about the people that do it that way the people that like vape inside like they're proving something yeah I know that's my take on it dude I don't got no problem with it but I I find it I find it I find like the theory that there will not be any long-term harm from vaping I question like I got a question it who knows maybe I'm wrong maybe the [ __ ] water like does a clintons maybe he cleanses your lungs it makes you healthier what do I know but uh yeah I've been to one of those stores I actually remember when they first kind of got popular that I went into one of the stores and something like you said someone actually was extremely helpful well you know trying to sell you [ __ ] he weren't helpful and I'm going to use car dealership - all right this next one is from divot pronounced divot he says like divot like what like like when you [ __ ] have a isn't that what they call it in golf yeah a divot you got to replace your divot if you don't know like if you're doing a chip shot in golf and you hit a little bit of ground out as well as the ball that's called a divot that that empty space and the ground is called a divot and you got to replace your divot you can't just leave it a hole and you got to find some other grass and put it on there anyway a big wax marko from canada AKA divot di VOT dropping in again for the first time in a little while as always I'm loving the podcast and actually anxiously awaiting the day t-rex returns a couple of months ago I sent you my album youth which I released in July and was wondering if you had a chance to check it out even if just briefly it took me three years to make and want to mean a lot if you would tell your podcast fans about my SoundCloud or Bandcamp granted that you actually liked the album WA I'm gonna be honest with you man I didn't listen to the whole album but it seemed that from the tracks that I heard on your band camp and say it seemed don't man it's a div ot band camp calm and soundcloud.com slash the real divot div ot and I'm glad you're waiting for t-rex hopefully I'll have t-rex back on the podcast and I'm like I always say I want to take this [ __ ] more seriously the podcast blah blah blah you've heard it a million times I'm not gonna [ __ ] do it but I do want to start getting guests on here more often um alright anyways my question for you this week what is the worst song you have ever made in your opinion and do you think that every project you've made have been has been progressively better than the last as an aspiring artist these questions intrigued me and many others who are working to be where you are sorry for the long email and keep on keeping on the worst song I've ever made is that it's gonna be you know I've made songs that like if I made the worst time I've ever made is not out there you know I mean it's like gonna on a hard drive somewhere and I wouldn't put it out but the worst song that's uh I have I have [ __ ] that I have from YouTube that makes me cringe I can't I can't think of it right now there's that you know that you know the much now much must respect to my boy Prince II but the song that I did with him I watched I watched that that that recently and even though it brings back good memories and it's a classic like my verses on there like the way that I look in the video and the way that I move in and [ __ ] like it's definitely it made me cringe like some of my old youtube videos like I can't watch now I just I'm just like yeah but uh I wouldn't I still wouldn't say that's by far not the worst song I've ever made I don't you think it's a bad song it's more more than wet the way I'm moving around the video and [ __ ] that in like you know what's the worst song than that and dumb would agree with me is the first song in the clockwise album it's on I can't stand that song that's it that might be the worst song that I've ever actually put out if I can hate that song do I think every project I've done has been progressively better than the last no no I don't necessarily think that I think that you know I know that some people I know that a lot of people like to say that that's how you're supposed to do things and [ __ ] but I think that you I think that every project I've done which I need to do a [ __ ] new one is I don't know I think that with music you can't always label things as better and worse you know like I know my favorite album I've done is the one that me and my brother did grizzly season and I've done tons of [ __ ] since then and you know I think that almost anybody else would argue that any of the any of the most reason most people would argue that all their most recent than last like three projects I did were better than that one but I disagree I think that shit's better I think it's more creative I think it's more interesting I think it it's definitely more of a standout and in in originality terms so that was like you know I've probably done five or six projects since then and that's not including like a lot of different internet [ __ ] that I've done too but that's I don't know I just think you know the old app the whole apples and oranges thing you know like I've I've done songs that are arguably better than that and I've become a better songwriter and I've definitely I've easily made more marketable [ __ ] and [ __ ] that's better to the masses than that and all that but you know I think that feeling wise and originality wise and artistically I still think that's probably the best thing I've done and I know that people don't agree you know but that's because people have to people need familiarity you know they need to be familiar with the sounds and that one's too weird and you know people use weird as a cop-out but I don't give a [ __ ] why don't one of my lying oh [ __ ] [ __ ] about a lie about that for I really think that's the best one all right I got one more letter here this is kind of a it's kind of a a lengthy one I don't think I probably shouldn't even read this whole thing but I actually it was even longer than this all right all right shut the [ __ ] up all right yo wax what's up man is Sean in Philadelphia long time no right yeah [ __ ] gas I got [ __ ] my nose is clogged up still getting over this sickness yeah this is Sean I met this I met Sean in Philly at the Warped Tour and I think I might even met him before that but he's a photographer a really good dude and he sent me he said a bunch of praise and it was awesome and I appreciate that man but when it got down to it he said this the first thing I wrote down was hallucinogens so I've been interested in seriously trying LSD for about two years now but it was just one of those things I never knew had who to ask or knew where to begin to think about getting a hold of that's interesting man because when I was younger I mean this is he still he's still about to say more [ __ ] but I'm just gonna go I was a side note when I was younger it was like in my high school it was really easy to get LSD really easy but right now like if I was like oh let me do some LSD like I would have no idea who the [ __ ] to ask about that and I think that's the you know it's just different in different places depending on where you're at depending on who you know depending on what year it is like certain drugs are available in certain drugs art all right this past June some of my wife works with came to a party at my place and her boyfriend pretty chill and we were talking for a while the subject came up he hooked me up about a week later with two tabs this is you said this past June okay so that's a long time ago so then I was like hmm when am I going to do this and with whom because I'm not trying to get [ __ ] up or some [ __ ] like that I just want to have an experience I've never had before I wanted to make sure I did it in the right place right time right people I have a friend I am comfortable with and Trust who had done it once or twice before and he said he was down and we plan to do it one weekend in late June but some [ __ ] came up and we had he had to cancel that weekend so because of the busy summer I never got around to it so now I've got these two tabs sitting in a ziplock baggie in my refrigerator and I have no idea when they're gonna be used I'm trying to figure out if I should just go for it and not be so uptight about set the setting and the people first of all I feel like I'm not a [ __ ] scientist man but I feel like June is a long time ago I feel like that should be in your freezer I don't know I'm sure you did I'm sure you [ __ ] googled like how should I keep acid for a long time I don't know but I feel like that should probably be in your freezer it's considering how old it is it's definitely like over time you know ask I don't know I also don't know you know how you have it most of the some people call tabs like there's these little sugar cube things there's like actual little capsules but most people refer to tab his bladder paper the blotter acid which was the kind that was popular when I was a kid and you know a few lis if you let that [ __ ] like basically for those you don't know like picture just like a piece of paper and you dip it in in acid you dip it in liquid and then take it out and it dries and then you [ __ ] take like a pizza cutter type of object and you cut it it looks like like the way that stamps the way that postage stamps are cut you know and but they're much much smaller than postage stamp so if you took a postage stamp size of acid you would be [ __ ] you'd be you know you'd be in a different universe it's probably like the average hit of acid is probably what you can fit like it's supposed to stands for different size with standard postage stamps probably the size of like ten hits of acid something like that maybe eight I don't know but um what was this question oh yeah I was I was saying it seems to me it seems to me like if it's sitting in the fridge I guess if it's in a baggie or something I don't I don't know you said a ziploc the two tabs sitting in a ziplock battery in my fret tab baggie and my first that's probably fine seems like it should be in the freezer but maybe the freezer is bad I don't know I don't know much about uh that type of scientific acid keeping but I did do that she had a pretty good amount of times when I was younger I didn't did that [ __ ] a solid dozen maybe a baker's dozen times something like that and uh I can I can give you some advice I think especially if you just want to do the [ __ ] once and you're not trying to get [ __ ] up and you want to have a cool experience you never had before it does matter the setting and it does matter the people and I can tell you when to do it and when not what you should not do is like just be going out one night and be like oh you know we're going to the bar hanging out friends I'll do acid don't do that that's a terrible idea very bad idea don't I wouldn't even recommend hanging out with other people expect like people you know especially but I wouldn't recommend being around other people that aren't also on acid because it's weird you look at them weird and they're not with you and if they find out your trip and they start [ __ ] with you you start to hate them they think it's funny and you know if you were them you think it's funny too but you don't the person tripping doesn't think it's funny at all if you have two hits to be you and your friend probably probably would be better to have at least three people probably would be better to have three people but I'd recommend something in nature man I'd recommend doing it during the daytime start start early you know so by the time it gets weird and nighttime is your it settled down a little bit I would recommend I don't know if you're because coming down from acid lasts a long time you know and we're coming down kind of just feels weird and if you're you know if you're older and you're if you're a drinker I'd recommend like you know eight to ten hours after you when you start to feel like you're coming down I'd recommend some alcohol to not overdo it it's a little bit to soothe that feeling of coming down and I just I wouldn't don't like don't go bowling don't I've done that sucked don't go to a [ __ ] amusement park everybody thinks going to an amusement park when you're on ass it's gonna be cool it's not like just because like you think like oh just go bunch of colors and rides and plow that [ __ ] freaks you out you don't want to be freaked out the best [ __ ] you can do is like a safe environment that's in nature or sometimes the cool thing to do is just like just be at somebody's crib just be at somebody's crib with just like all just the people that are that are in it and make sure you have nothing else to do that day don't have like other [ __ ] going on you know I mean don't have don't it don't be like oh well I get five I got to go do this for an hour but I'll be cool I'll just be tripping doing that just do that for a little while you know oh I got to go eat with my family real quick I'll just go do that and then I'll be out like don't do some [ __ ] like that like it's a very powerful drug you got it you got to have the whole day and you should have the whole day planned out so you don't have to do anything that's my advice about doing that and that was only the first half of Sean's email well the second half is kind of like more some some stuff that is uh alright [ __ ] yeah I think I think this is okay the other thing I wanted to ask you about this keep in mind Shauna's from Philadelphia and the Trocadero is like a well-known venue in Philadelphia the other thing I wanted to ask you about was what your what was your opinion on playing the Trocadero mainstage compared to playing the track balcony I played the balcony with my old band a few times in the past and was cool but I don't think it was one of my favorite place we played although like ten years ago we played there and now I'm thinking about it I remember it was one of the tightest we ever played so what the [ __ ] do I know maybe I just remember lugging all the gear up the staircase which doesn't seem to end this past January my friend recruited me to play drums for a show his band was playing there on the main stage I don't play with a band very often anymore maybe once a year and I do know any of the songs and we only had like four practice sessions to make [ __ ] work I was nervous as [ __ ] but this was one of those opportunities I did not want to pass up I've been going to shows of the track since I was in junior high and playing on the main stage even though I know that's not that big of a deal was a huge deal to me we were the closing band so I had many hours to chill have the proper amount of beers to relax but no not [ __ ] up any songs well done and we pretty much killed it I won't lie it was one of the greatest feelings of my entire life just pure elation I also felt like the [ __ ] man when I got off stage and saw my wife standing there backstage grinning at me like I was a [ __ ] hero that's awesome maybe I forgot what it's like to play a show and kick ass and know that you did well and the people liked it I don't know anyway I'm a [ __ ] braggy [ __ ] apparently ha ha ha how do you like the main stage you think on a smaller toy you'll play the balcony again or no did you take a [ __ ] in the toilet in the room at the end of the hall backstage at the truck I don't know if I took a [ __ ] there but I know exactly what you're talking about I did and everyone in the room could hear everything even with the other band playing alright man I'm not gonna bother asking you about anything else I was going to because this is already turning into a novel just want to say what's up well what's up man that's just just for people that don't earn familiar with the Trocadero in Philly you might have a venue around you it's like almost I know through experience in almost all cities have a venue that has like a big-ass main stage where maybe 1500 people that's probably the Trocadero capacity is probably about the main room is probably 1,500 people but then also they have this balcony section which is probably 250 probably 2 and 250 is [ __ ] packed but I played the balcony like 4 times and uh the last the last three times the first time was not but I think the 3 last 3 times we played there it was sold out and uh and then this last time on winter vention that we actually ended up doing the mainstage and it was really awesome too but if you listen to an old podcast I don't know I actually don't even know if it's a podcast maybe was an interview but several times in multiple interviews I've been asked where is my favorite place to play and have said the Trocadero balcony the Trocadero balcony there's there's an intimacy at that venue that really is unmatched by any other any other venue I've ever played at with with the possible exception of like you know a coffee shop like Cafe Muse where I used to do the waxen a jack show in LA but like there's just and it's it's it has to do with the people in Philly to the people in Philly are awesome like they're certain they're certain the way the way that they are there and the way that people would behave at those shows and like the way that people would call stuff out but not annoyingly that like there's like you know there's certain people that heckle and yell and they're drunk and that's really kind of they really kind of make the show about them and like come talk to me type of [ __ ] and they're the most annoying fact like the most annoying crowd people there are but people in Philly are different at least at these shows they it was like people would print it was very participatory you know I've said it many on many occasions at the Trocadero balcony was my favorite place to play I've had I had shows there that were just amazing so I was there where they were and it's [ __ ] up too because there's the small place so to get on the stage you have to walk through the crowd and to get off the stage like you know you'd be like thank you thanks to all that smells my last song and then to get off the stage you have to walk through the crowd and I had a couple shows there where they're like nah like they wouldn't part like I've already done like two encores and they wouldn't [ __ ] part and you haven't you there's no backstage there's no nothing there's not even closet back there like you have to just just kind of like de determined when the show stops and that [ __ ] was kind of amazing and uh yeah I've always said that that was my favorite place to play I did we did the mainstage this time and it was great but you know I like the small shows man you know there's like the biggest show I ever did was don't al Enzo fest I have a picture that [ __ ] somewhere on my Instagram but it's [ __ ] ridiculous was 80,000 people it was in Vienna Austria like literally like theirs we were the people on the stage and there's [ __ ] 80,000 people and they're like that is amazing but like and but but the other the other like that's amaze like a packed packed room with two or three hundred people was amazing [ __ ] even 100 people but like once you I don't know once you get to like that once you get to like once you get to like a thousand sized room it kind of loses a little bit of intimacy the stage is all high you can't really touch people you know like you find ways to do it like some way sometimes you know if you get a wireless mic and you kind of run out run out in the crowd and stuff like that Watsky is really good at making a big venue seem small you know but uh but yeah I don't know I can't imagine for like for like huge artists who plays stadiums all their lives like for like if they're like true performers they love it they they they'd probably be [ __ ] it super excited to do like a small club you know that's why they that's why they do little Poppins and little last-minute things at the Viper Room and [ __ ] like that but uh yeah that's what I got to say about that congratulations on you playing there by the way and you're like yeah even though it's not that big of a deal was a huge deal to me we you were you you had gone there as your kid watching shows and you're having an opportunity to play there like it is a big deal man it is if it's a huge deal to you then it is a big deal you know like who gets a [ __ ] if it's a big deal somebody else you know if everybody thought that way know what nothing would be a big deal you know that's [ __ ] ain't there's a lot of people that playing at the track mainstage isn't a big deal it's a very arbitrary goal musicians have very arbitrary goals like I've seen people celebrate like you know like even me like going from the track to the balcony like that was a big step like that was something to celebrate and it's like it's very arbitrary and then you like it was a day like if you come to a city the third time and play the same venue that it's sold out like you celebrate and it's like you know some people don't give a [ __ ] about that you know it's you know just like I don't care about to go like you know so if some computer programmer just figured out another computer language he celebrates that I don't care about that goal it's not my goal it's not a big deal to me huge deal to him you know so it was good for you then good for you and I think that's about all I got I'm about to do a little bit of editing on that middle section of this podcast actually got to do some editing today see how I'm see how I'm doing right now I'm taking the extra steps I'm doing the extra work I'm hustling extra hard I'm gonna true

like in F sharp major or you can just tune the ukulele down a half step which is just the easiest thing because if you keep it in its original tuning it's gonna be in G major and you can do that if it's more comfortable for you vocally but it's not the original key of the song so I would recommend going down a half step if you want to be authentic the right words but [Music] that's better C G and those are really the only chords you need technically but if you want to have fun with it you can also use C minor g7 G major 7 and then g7 first just figure out how to play those opening chords and rhythm so you have [Music] remember throughout this song you can really just use C and C minor interchangeably in G & G major 7 originally I think I like using C minor in places where you express the major because it makes it a little jazzy yeah so yeah so the tablature [Music] [Music] - so you just think of the same tablet or you just put the chords on to it that's probably the easiest way to get so you have to remember on this chord when you're doing the G major 7 or the GA your cord you lift up the cord before you play the open string because then it's gonna sound like the two and you don't want that so you have five then let's go into the race strum strum strum strum strum look lap strum strum strum strum and that's basically it and so and then you can do another strum up clap if you so desire I just did a lot because I it something is a happen at you so you know apart from that let's get into sorry I'm checking the time okay kissing you then we start switching it up to see how we went from like that strum strum just strum clap some you can just do that what you really to you can do strum strum strum strum then you go to strum that strum strum clap really simple then you have the I'm scared part so I'm scared part you're really just repeating the intro scared of telling you how I feel about the injury maybe just shine you can see you don't you and then you just go back into the original price oh yeah any verse or at the part after that I'm scared you just want to go to C C minor G that's probably the best thing to do because they think like it's kind of glow his przemek is probably kind of good to go back to the originally the original integrity of the song yeah and then you just end with the intro so you have how I did it was actually a mistake I didn't mean to do that but I accidentally like lifted my finger too late so this is how you do like the iconic ending [Music] and then before you get to two you want to have your pointer finger right here you just play the two strings so you're playing to second fret of the third string and you're playing blaster and that's about it I'm gonna tag my original video here so that you guys can go check that out once you're done figuring out all the technical the technical stuff of it and then yeah and tell me what you think this is my first tutorial obviously it was a little shaky I'll try to take my time a little bit more and I'll also try to do like more explenation or chords later but let me know what content you guys want because usually I used to buy YouTube video just to post stuff that I really want to do but if you guys want to do stuff or if you guys want to hear stuff or if you guys want to send me stuff just like let me know in the comments and I'd be happy to listen to you because you guys are the reason I'm doing this tutorial like the reason I'm doing this tutorial is because of you guys thank you see", "o2bUj6SHMDM": "[Music] you", "RV5yWPqJtUY": "[Music] waxes podcast you go waxes podcast go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go yeah yeah yes what's up y'all this is wax come to you live not really live as I used to say in the first couple podcast it's not really live it's being recorded right now so as I speak it's kind of live because I'm just saying whatever the [ __ ] comes off the top of my dome here and the reason that I started the podcast off with such a such a burst of cheerleader cheerleader type of rhetoric there was one task I'm doing right now this is gonna [ __ ] something up by me telling you this it's gonna [ __ ] up the secrecy of this task but let me start by explaining to you that a music video I did last year called feels good if you were to watch that music video feels good wax featuring eat featuring Anderson PAC produced by eom if you were to watch that video on YouTube the music video for that song there's many times in that video not many times but some times where I used some footage from like like family home movie footage from my family from back in the day and in order to make that happen my mother was nice enough my mom was one of the nice person you know people she's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet and she loves to uh to help me she loves doing things to help me and one of the things she did to help me was she packed up all these old tapes I believe there are eight millimeter tapes yeah they're either 8 millimeter or 9 millimeter one of the two but their tapes from an old school type of video camera they're like they're not VHS tapes are smaller they're like the same size as old cassette tapes but in in in height and in length and height but not in width they're wider than that they're the same size as they're the same size as like a box of playing cards but but if the playing cards had like maybe 150 percent of the actual amount of cards so you know if if there was 78 cards in every deck then a box of playing cards would be approximately the same size as one of these old 8 millimeter tapes let's put it that way hold on and uh we had a bunch of those it was cool - it was cool she said she sent me a box of them and in order for me to get the footage from from these tapes into some kind of onto some kind of digital format you know I did research out here in Hollywood there's there's tons of places out here we you know we're not tons but a lot of places out here because this is kind of like the movie industry you never know what kind of footage people are digging up where you can just find random film reels old beta tapes VHS tapes whatever you name it and there's places that digitize the footage that's like a business out here and uh I looked into how much it would be to digitize all this footage to make my music video and I realized that it's really expensive to do if you get something to do it especially considering I have a I had like a pretty big box full of tapes and you know you do the math for a music video especially for that music video what I needed I probably only needed you know 30 seconds if that worth of footage but the task was going through these hours and hours and hours of footage and deciding which footage finding like the needles in the haystack to use for the video cuz you know a lot of the a lot of the stuff that's on these videos is not actually usable for a music video like it was supposed to be like you know clips of me as a kid kind of starting to be into music and kind of like starting to do things that actually have to do with my musical career whereas a vast vast majority of the home footage that we have doesn't have anything to do with that but um everything that I've said so far has just been explained to you that I have this box of tapes and after and after figuring out that it was too expensive I mean I'm still sidetracking really just let me stop even mention the fact that I'm side track and let me just keep talking about this story I have this box of tapes and in order to get them from get the footage off the tape and get them into some kind of digital format I found out through research they're probably the best thing for me to do would just be to kind of do it myself and go through the footage here and the best way to do that was to find something that played the tapes and find something to record them onto a digital format and the most realistic way to do it was to find a camera an old-school camera and a DVD burner both technologies that at one point were awesome and new and only the richest people in the land can even afford to think about these [ __ ] items much less own them and now what did I do I bought both of them at the same time for like a hundred bucks from some weirdo in Craig Craigslist so that goes to show you how I got that dude was really a weirdo to eom was with me he was such a weirdo on the phone that I was like you know what I'm not gonna even go down to this dude's house by myself he lived in some town like it wasn't a rough town but just it was like a town I'd never heard of you know somewhere in the South Bay area of LA and the dude on the phone just like wouldn't stop [ __ ] talking so I was like man I'm gonna bring my friend a friend with me just in case this dude tries to rape me or something so uh so so I brought him with me as my rape protector and I I didn't up buying this DVD burner and and you know and that that the camera that has it's the original kind of camera that you know you record thing on these tapes because you can't really get like a VCR that plays the tapes the people the things that people would play the tape on was just the camera so if you just hook the camera right up to your TV so in order to get the footage for the music video I watched all the footage and when I found little clips that I liked I'd record them onto a DVD and take that DVD and use that to get the footage onto a computer so my mom had asked me you know right around Christmastime maybe something like that you know it's almost so it's like summer now it's just becoming summer and around Christmastime or something great rate when I was on I think I was on tour or something I don't even know what what happened but my mom was like you know what you could do for me is you could you could give me that footage in a digital manner basically and she went basically she wanted to see if she could get DVDs of all the footage that she gave me and that's what I'm going through now what I'm one of the tasks that I'm doing right now since my mom listens to this podcast usually it's now not a surprise because I'm going back there I'm going I'm going to visit with my mom and dad next week and I was gonna surprise them but I know my mom would be surprised because I usually don't actually do things that are nice and caring and loving for them you know they would assume that I would just forget to do it but I'm gonna come down there with a stack of DVDs I mean there's like there's probably twenty five of these tapes and you can't it's not like you know nowadays where people just kind of hit a button in things record you got to sit through it and uh and just let it record in real time hold on one second so we're probably talking about somewhere in the area of 50 hours worth of footage something like that probably that I'm gonna end up giving to them and if you the amount first of all the amount of footage on this that's not entertaining to watch is ridiculous my dad was probably the worst family camera man of all time and it was only a close second to if he well he was a close second he was actually a distant second to if he ever gave my mom the camera cuz she was even worse and then if he gave it to me and my brother and my sister we'd all be bad so our family vacation footage wasn't the best like we had a family vacation we're from Maryland and one time I guess I was probably about 10 or 11 and we drove to Cooperstown New York and the reason we drove to Cooperstown New York is for those of you that don't know Cooperstown New York is the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame so you know we're gonna go we'll go look at the Baseball Hall of Fame I had baseball cards I was into baseball we went to games I liked I had the stats all that stuff I was never a good player of baseball but you know I guess when I was 10 or 11 definitely good enough to want to go and and take a family vacation to see the Hall of Fame of baseball so we went up there and first of all there's at least an hours where the footage of us where my I think we just we must have just gotten this video camera at the time cuz my dad just holds the video camera out the window of the car when we're on the highway and he just does that for like an hour like as if it's like oh look here's the side of the house here's the side of the highway you know everyone so why he like looks in the car and like points the camera to like I sleeping in the back and they might say what's up to my mom driving and then just points it right back out the window and he never hit stop he just records for like an hour then we get up to Cooperstown and when we go into the Hall of Fame my dad actually like brings the camera in there and like you know there's parts of there's parts of the Hall of Fame where if you can picture it picture like a plaque like when you go into a museum and there's a plaque with some somebody a legendary face you know what I mean like that might not even be a real photo it might just be like an engraving it looks almost like an award like a trophy like a merit plaque like you know as if you got a Lifetime Achievement Award for baseball and they'll have your face like engraved in some kind of gold and then they'll have your story which is like a short paragraph that's it's on a placard underneath the picture of you which is all on some piece of wood that just looks like one big plaque so if you were to look at it and say like Ty Cobb Ty Cobb played for the blah blah blah in 1907 I think he played for the Detroit Tigers in 1907 he was one of the leading players at that time with a batting average of blah blah blah and blah blah blah he died in 1946 of colon cancer like that's about how long it would be you know I don't know if he died of colon cancer I have no idea how I Cobb died but I think he was the one that had the really valuable playing card but but anyway my dad won't my dad would do is if you saw a placard like that which there was a lot of them he would hold the family home video camera on that and like give it enough time so you could read the whole thing and then he'd slowly move the video camera onto another one and then he'd leave it on there give you enough time so you can read the whole thing as if as if sometime in the distant future you know the people from the Cooperstown museum we're gonna be like you know what let's see let's use the Jones family footage for for our promotional DVD that we're gonna put out in case anybody wants to just see this you know for the virtual reality tour the virtual tour of our our establishment here let's use the Jones family footage or if it or if any of our relatives when when my dad shows in the footage on on the day after Christmas or whatever whenever work together as a family and my dad shows the family home movies like that's what they want to see they won't actually see and read every single player in the Hall of Fame I don't know you know maybe I'm being hard on my dad's footage but it was kind of funny to me looking at it and that's that that's only there but it but you know if you watch it you'll see like it's it's really weird to watch that own footage like it's freaky you know it's you know you see people that aren't alive anymore in the footage but even more so than that it's just to me it's just weird to see these these recorded days from from a long time ago that it just looks like it's it's like at this that these things happen but it almost it's hard to give them it's hard to tell you - it's like an emotional thing when you watch it it's just like it's almost like you're watching ghosts or something and I'm not just talking about because some people aren't alive anymore I'm talking about just just in general you know even watching yourself as a kid or watching your parents or just it's just weird seeing these old these old times that now seems so far away that you almost don't remember them and there's like the little things are weird I could like you know the footage one of my dad's shooting in the car and you hear the radio guy you know and like even that sounds older and like cars look a little older and people's clothing looks a little older so it's kind of freaky to watch but I said all of that to tell you that I was the last thing that I was digitizing this was actually probably the worst thing that he shot was um me and my brother I guess when we were in middle school were on the school soccer team and uh you know we we were playing a game and my dad sat on the sidelines and one in in one area and film the entire middle school soccer game and maybe that doesn't even sound as bad as it is but it's it's you know it's very far from watching the [ __ ] world couple in television let's put it that way it's very much less exciting than that especially considering every few minutes whoever's taping and I think was at my dad and my sister we're kind of trading every five minutes somebody kind of gives up for a couple seconds then just like they switch hands and it gets shaky and then I even really on the ball following the ball and you know it's a solid hour and a half maybe maybe maybe an hour of just an entire soccer game but I you know now my parents are gonna have that digitized I actually fat i actually straight fast forwarded some of it because I was like there's no way they're gonna watch this but what I did watch a tiny bit of I mean I watched a lot of the game actually I started I started watching after a while when uh the the angles were right but I couldn't even tell like you know it's old school footage so I couldn't even tell what the [ __ ] I was on the field but the the most interesting part in the part that kind of made me laugh was the cheerleaders first of all it's funny in general that a middle school soccer team has has full-blown cheerleaders that do cheers and at halftime they they go out and do straight-up cheers but uh what made me laugh about it is if you're from Maryland especially either Baltimore or maybe southern really anywhere in [ __ ] Maryland or really even if you're from the Philadelphia area cuz they have the same [ __ ] going on with their O's have you ever seen Bam Margera talk he's a good example but um you know people from Maryland I've lost it a little bit but if you you meet someone that's really born and raised in Southern Maryland or really born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia or Baltimore when they say things they say him and give I'm gonna go down the road go him and I talk like that a lot more when I was a kid and I mean when I see myself as a kid on the tape I'm actually shocked about how much of a Maryland accent I had but it was just so [ __ ] funny these little there's like 15 middle school girls and they're doing a cheer and they just [ __ ] like goo goo go go go doot doot yeah like if you can hear they're all their accents at the same time and two sounded funniest [ __ ] to me so that's why I started off my podcast episode 61 with a little bit of a throwback go northern that's the middle school I went to go [ __ ] it northern go northern game northern game northern bobcats you care northern share that share the hit share the road team that the home team is boss but uh yeah so that's what's going on with my life one thing that's going on with that there's a million things that are actually going on with it one thing that's going on with it is that I'm digitizing those tapes for my mom I got a lot of it done and by the time I get home I will I will have a lot more and I hopefully will have all them digitized for you so mom if you're listening I'm not slacking at least too hard on that the very least even if I gave you the footage already had you'd have a solid amount and not saying it's entertaining you know you're not gonna win any Oscars anytime soon for Best Best Screenplay about a trip to Cooperstown New York you're not gonna be winning the Oscar soon but um what else is going on doing that big stories in my life big stories I am making music I know a lot a lot of people been hitting me up and I [ __ ] deserve it cuz you know I'm that's what I do for a living I make music and I'm lucky enough that I fans and I'm lucky enough that I have people that listen to my music and buy my music and buy tickets to see me perform so I don't have to have a regular job look at me I'm over here I don't have to work I go in this establishments and I say hello I can I can use can you help me can you [ __ ] help me they say can I help you I'm getting paid to be here to [ __ ] help you I don't want to be here I don't I want to be with my family I want to be with my family right now I don't want to be serving you I went to the dentist this morning I walk in then there somebody can I help you I'm the receptionist here at the dentist office I don't necessarily want to be here but I have to make a living for my family to be able to survive can i [ __ ] help you you entitled piece of [ __ ] that sits around all day and thinks of words that rhyme like a expert crossword puzzle player you [ __ ] she didn't actually say that but my point is I I'm not entitled to what I'm to what I have I'm not entitled to be able to live this life that I live I gotta [ __ ] do things I got to work I got to make songs if I'm gonna if I'm gonna be a musician I got to make music and what I've been doing recently is making a [ __ ] lot of it so for all the people out there have been hitting me up like yo I want some new [ __ ] coming out what are you doing why aren't you making any new [ __ ] I got some new [ __ ] coming I don't know when it's gonna come out I don't know exactly how I'm gonna how I'm gonna do this I'm more I guess I guess I guess I'm just I'm working on an album I guess that's probably the best way to put it I'm working on some kind of album and I got a bunch of [ __ ] I'm working on it's sounding good and feeling super inspired and hopefully that I don't I don't know when it's gonna come out because I I'm afraid about to go on tour for the summer so putting a little bit of a wrench into that plan but hopefully the tour since the tour is kind of a luxury tour more the more a more luxury luxurious tour than I'm used to maybe I can use some of the free time to really write a lot of music and when I say that it's a luxurious tour I don't mean that the Warped Tour is a luxurious tour I mean the way that we're right the way that we're doing the tour is uh on the next level of anything I've done before and when this is what I mean I've been doing this for a long time I've toured I've toured my old band used to tour and you know we didn't we didn't [ __ ] with hotels we didn't make money we were happy to just get free beer and we would drink as much of it as we could at the venue offered us free beer they probably wouldn't even have us back the next time because we had six people in the band and one person selling merch and we would drink as much as we possibly could because we probably weren't making any money and then we pass out on some random fans floor and we didn't really even have fans so if that would even be a lucky thing so who newswoman who knew where you're gonna sleep who knew out wherever you're gonna get there we might take random people's cars some person might take a train then eventually we had of a van that I actually bought that of course ran it through I bought the band now I had it for a second while the band was together but as soon as I got our website really big on the side of the van the band broke up of course and you know we never made any money we tore we slept on people's floors then you know me and my brother we did the low budget wax novelty tour we have my Sentra we made a tiny tiny bit of money but not enough to really stay in hotels we did a couple night but it was just one of those tours where we're getting drunk too much we didn't eat properly we got sick the whole entire time usually sleep on the floors lost a bunch of money for the [ __ ] tour that's another thing about the earlier tours like you know we weren't making money touring we had to save money in order to tour you know you spent money to try to be able to get your name out and all that [ __ ] and is this [ __ ] thing working sorry about that but uh you know and then after well you know I've been doing this for a long time I've been touring for a long time making music for a long time and eventually you know in the past couple years I've got to the point where we can rent and a big van and trailer and go out I have a full band everybody in the bank and stay in a hotel if we got if we got it the first shows far away I pay for people to fly out there cetera et cetera still not making much money I mean in some cases not making much at all but you know I'm making a living through all this all this stuff and but one thing I've never done is I've never had a tour bus never been on a bus I've literally literally I don't even think I've ever been on been on a tour bus at all in my life but this Warped Tour me and the homie watski and our in our band that were that we're splitting all of all mutual friends everybody's mutual friends I mean watch he pretty much have the same band with the exception of he has a singer that joins him and I have a om that joins me but we're all going to be in a [ __ ] bus so what that means is that we all have a place to sleep we all have a bunk on the bus and overnight when the bus is driving because we have an actual driver none of us have to drive the bus you know we can be asleep and then during the day the bus will pretty much be stationary usually during the day even if even if it's not we're not like you know even when we had the van with with with the band as big as we had it there's usually three people on each bench seat of the van maybe there's two on one but usually you're sitting in the you're sitting on a seat where like you know there's dude next to he's got his laptop his [ __ ] phone chargers hanging over and in between your legs and somebody's elbow is hitting you on the other side then your feet are kind of raised because there's two backpacks underneath you you know like it's not I'm not complaining by any means but I'm just I'm only pointing out that the next level up that we're about to be on is much a much much different type of thing you know like when you can get up walk around you can go sleep in your bunk if you want you can sit on various different type of seats in the back there's like practically like a theater there's like picture like a small booth like a booth for that's a big booth for - a small booth for for in a restaurant there's like a seat or two that I think there might be two of those kind of booths so you could like sit there and put your laptop up on the computer and like you know when you hear about people being a bit like recording and getting [ __ ] done on the road it's usually because they have a bus like this it's they're not usually in a shitty year situation and uh that's also an excuse for me not really doing that too much before but uh yeah so Headley at least at least when it comes to writing what I'm hoping to do is have most of the tracks and [ __ ] ready by the time I go on tour and I can spend a lot of my off time which I'll have a lot of I'll have a lot of off time on them on the road y'all should check that out man vans if you just Google Vans Warped Tour dates you know you can find to find out if I'm playing next next to where you live if you live in the United States unfortunately I will not make the Canada shows [ __ ] sucks but I'm not gonna be able to make there's two shows in Canada one in Toronto and one in Montreal and I will not be at those shows so hopefully you guys can make it to the US shows if you live in another country hopefully I'll be there later but you know it's gonna be a fun summer and hopefully I'll get some of this work done I'll be with a om the whole time so maybe him me and him we're talking about even making just trying to like really knock out some [ __ ] while we're on the road too because there's a lot there's a lot of free time on this tour it's not like most tours like you know you got you got a lot of time where you're sitting around and it's and there's room and there's a little bit more comfort and you want to get stuff done so maybe maybe this tour I'll be able to get some [ __ ] done but I am working on music and hopefully I'll have some stuff out soon hopefully I'll have a [ __ ] barrage of stuff out soon and what else is going on in my life that write anything down write down all right then I am making music MattyB in Baltimore who emailed me wanted me to tell a story from when I was in college but I didn't think of a good one and then I have a tire flat one leg guy oh this is an interesting story that's how one more story before I get to questions and stuff so last week last week I was in Los Angeles and I was driving through Hollywood and bam my tire popped my back my back passenger side tire was flat and it was black popped flat like not like oh I can drive somewhere flat like it was like this really shouldn't be driven on so I just pulled over to the side of the road like it like you could feel like oh oh oh you notice I pulled over the side of the road and I got really really lucky there was an autozone like three blocks away from where where I was where you know where I'm where my tire blew right there on a venison LaBrea so I guess the [ __ ] I guess that yes that was Pico and really close to La Brea that the Auto Zone was at so if you've ever been to that autozone know that I was there last week and the reason I had to go to the Auto Zone you're thinking so cuz some of you guys are thinking wait a second why'd you have to go to the shouldn't you have all the X all the parts needed all the accessories / equipment needed within your vehicle to change a tire if not you should because that's the safe way to be a [ __ ] where they caught motorists there's another word for motorists that I wanted to use right there anyway I didn't for some reason this is the first time I've had a flat tire like it was the it was literally the first time that I've had to pull the little donut out from under my trunk in my Nissan Sentra the first time with this car I'm pretty sure it was at least I think the last time I had a flat tire was with my old car which was also a Nissan sensor so I could be getting them confused but the [ __ ] looked brand new it looked like it was been sitting there and it still had like the little foam over top of it and I know myself if I had removed that I probably would have [ __ ] it up or damaged it somehow so it looked like it had never been removed but for some reason and I looked everywhere I looked all over the trunk all over the car I even look even looked in the users manual to see where it should where it was supposed to be and the place where I was supposed to be it wasn't I was missing that like the wrench like the lug wrench that you used for you know a - you have to use it to [ __ ] get the tires off you know - to get the [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] they're called I'm not real good with like cars and [ __ ] like that but to get the you know - to get the [ __ ] lug nuts off of the off of the tire so you can take the old tire off and put the spare tire on to get that off you need this wrench but even just as importantly is that to Jack your car up to get the tire off the wrench actually always doubles as a part where you [ __ ] crank the jack up to Jack your car up and for whatever reason that piece was missing from my car so luckily luckily enough I was able to go into autozone and get that piece so it wasn't it wasn't a tragedy and I walked over to autozone right there labret in Venice and I walked in I got that got the piece I needed I actually almost got the got some other dumb [ __ ] but I got I got the thing that I needed when I got to the when I got to the cash register there was a god there was I got to the cash register and then the guy behind the cash register couldn't use the cash register he was at you know picture picture you're looking at the cash register right and there's a long and some of you have been to autozone so you can picture it there's a long row there's a long like it's like it's like being at a bar you know if you look to your left it's just a long counter that goes left and right and you know if you're if if you were looking at it like there's one line he it's a one long line but when you get to the front of it just like you would at the post office you know it's like a bar but there's different stations for cashiers so when I got to when I got to the front I wasn't it wasn't there was no line at all I just walked right to the where the guy was weird where that no I walked right worth this is like such a stupid part of the story to even get stuck on I walked up to the counter there was nobody there the guy comes out and I like put my thing on the counter and he's like oh no we can't use this register so we walk over the other register and the problem with the other register was there was a [ __ ] guy leaning on the leaning on the the bar slash table slash calendar he was leaning on the counter right where that station was and this guy had one leg he had one leg and he had those kind of crutches that were like kind of like almost connected to your arm you know like they actually go up your arm and there's like kind of like a loop that you put your arms through right about the elbow and he had one [ __ ] leg table you know he was two crutches in one leg and he was leaning he was waiting for his friend to get whatever he had to get and he was leaning on the [ __ ] counter and you really he was a big dude he looked like he looked like he probably lost that leg in the war he was proud that he was probably pushing 60 big dude look like a dude that probably lost his leg in the war that could be wrong I don't know but he was he was a pretty big dude and he was definitely like making like when he was sitting on it he was making the counter creak like goes Pig let's think about like a not too strong piece of wood if you put a lot of weight on it that noise and if he was made any movement it would creak further and he was standing right there in front of the [ __ ] the thing where you swipe your credit card like really like you couldn't swipe your car because he was there and when we went to this area the guy behind the counter was like look buddy they talk like that he said look buddy you can't you cannot stand there you got to break it you're gonna break it and the guy [ __ ] look behind him look behind himself because he was facing the other way he wasn't no picture his ass is on the counter the counter you know I'm saying so the guy [ __ ] rose up he had some buttons in the cashier and he goes look look buddy you gonna break this can I sit there you gonna break this and the guy [ __ ] turns around real slowly he looked like he ever seen happy gilmore not as big as that do but remember the dude from happy gilmore that ended up with a [ __ ] nail in his head if that dude was black in fact if that dude was a black dude this dude looked like him with one leg but it's not as quite as big as intimidating as him but his face the expression of his face and the grizzled nature of his face was like the black version of the guy from happy gilmore they had a nail in his head and he turns around really slowly and he just shakes his head and he goes I got one leg man and I was just like goddamn so any that's that's that happened and then he [ __ ] rang up my little [ __ ] lug nut wrench and I didn't have any cash on me I had to swipe my [ __ ] and the guy goes go ahead go ahead like like pointed like like pointed towards the cat the credit card thing that this dude was clearly covering up and like like he put the effort it almost was like in that cent second he put the ethical dilemma onto my shoulders you know like he couldn't get the good guy to move and you know when he said he had one leg I was in my head I'm like I cannot [ __ ] argue with you there I looked down and I said he absolutely you do and in my [ __ ] opinion that kind of entitles you to take a little rest take a load off on just about any counter you want especially considering he was in there cuz he had a friend that was like in there buying some [ __ ] and he was just waiting for his friend and he had one [ __ ] leg like he'd like you said and uh and you know it was my it was my job now to to [ __ ] make this and I looked at the [ __ ] dude behind the counter and I said yo I'm not telling this guy to move I said it just like that and the dude kind of looked at me that the the one-leg dude kind of looked at me and he didn't look at me like oh that's cool that's cool man I understand I appreciate you like kind of thinking that way you know he just looked at me when hmm like that and just [ __ ] left he went he did anyway he like just got up off the counter you could almost see the counter lift up when he got up you know like as if it was like as if the counter was a [ __ ] Springs had shocks on the bottom of it when he got up you could almost see it lift up here at creak maybe you could even hear the dude the one-legged dudes body and crutches creak and at the same time and it just sounded like this it sounded like the [ __ ] if the if if the counter could say aah as if he had just you know given a [ __ ] fat girl piggyback ride if he could say that he would have if he was a person so the guy what but the guy the guy with one leg like he you know he walked out it as we walked his why he's not generally walk but you know he walked like with his crutches and his one leg out of the store and I swiped my card and then I got my I got my [ __ ] lug nut wrench walked my three blocks and then another interesting thing even even happened while I was changing my tire I was changing my tire and I was I you know I was getting I was getting the [ __ ] off I had already jacked up the car and I had already just taken the this flat tire off and I was putting the doughnut on and this other dude another black dude came walked by and this dude was kind of like he was kind of like guy now I feel like I got to make movie references for all the black dudes I mean during this tire tire experience but this dude was kind of he was kind of he was kind of like he had a lot of pep in his step you know he looked like a professional like a business business professional like that was kind of headed to workers it was like a Wednesday at noon or something so like most people it was like working hours and he had a lot of pep in his step I can't think I can't unfortunately I can't they a movie reference especially because I already killed it with the happy gilmore one but he had a lot of pep in step right and I'm there and he goes ah no donut huh like if you guys don't know most you do but like a spare tire on a car especially for your people or don't speak English as their first language just spare tire on a car and the United States is often referred to as a donut because it's like it's just a small version of a tire that you only drive for a little while well you're only supposed to drive it for a little while before you get a new tire it's really you know they call it a donut and the guy comes by and he goes donuts huh yeah he goes man I hate them [ __ ] and I had looked at I was like yeah man this thing just ruined my day and he stopped for a second and he looks at me and he kind of gets like real serious kind of like he's about to say some real [ __ ] and he goes well you know what brother you can start your day over whatever you want and I [ __ ] looked at him because I was feeling I'd like you know I didn't this this spare tire incident this flat tire incident had actually [ __ ] my day up a little bit like that's why I told him it ruined my day because you know that feeling when you get a flat tire and just like [ __ ] this I don't feel like getting out of my car and changing a tire right now especially if you're me and you're lazy by nature and like I'm not really into cars like I'm always worried I'm gonna [ __ ] something up anyway and you know this really did [ __ ] up my day I was on my way to somewhere actually and I had to cancel some [ __ ] I was doing and I told him that it ruined my dad and he looked at me and said you know our brother you can start your day over whenever you want to and I [ __ ] looked at him and I was like man thank you for saying that and he was like no problem and if I can walked away so interesting it was an interesting experience interesting enough for me to write it down and interesting enough for me to say it on waxes podcast podcast but now it was cool it was cool like because it you know he's right you can't like one you once you get moving and I had it tonight because you know then you get the doughnut on then you have to go to the tire place and then you got drop money you didn't really want to drop that day and it's the classic yeah a flat tire is the classic like thinking about some other [ __ ] because this is what was going on that day I was thinking about some other [ __ ] and thinking about you know I was already I was already a little stressed out and having some other problems and then that flat a flat tire is just one of those things man that's like the [ __ ] cherry on top you know like the thing that didn't have to go wrong the thing that you didn't foresee the thing that just comes out of left field I mean car problems in general or like that goddamn especially when you're broke if when you're broke but you know just just not broke enough to own a car and then something happens to your car and especially because a lot of times you know your car without your car especially if you're you know it's a little it's a little different in major cities but to most of us who live in suburbia and [ __ ] like that you know without your car you kind of can't get to work you know it's a big problem to not have your car if something goes wrong with it all the money you plan to paying on paying your rent you all your little budget you had going on BAM something happens to your car and it's just everything gets [ __ ] up so the car car problems are generally the cherry on top when it comes to stressing you out and there's something for about this dude saying that I could start my day over at any time because that's it that's really something that you can use for anything you know it doesn't have to be your day can be your life like your day kid you can just start over whenever you want it can be your life it can be your love life it can be your year it can be your music career it can be anything you know you can always start over it doesn't matter you can always just [ __ ] scrap what you got and start over there's no need of stress over it why cry over spilled milk and maybe even be used in that situation I suppose but uh that was some of my stories for this week let me get to some shout out some questions alright shoutouts for this week Dwight G from Toronto or known as the infamous rapper degrease that's funny I used to know I had no idea who goes by degreaser as his rap name miracle from Austria whose EP is now online that's HTTP HTTP colon backslash backslash are those back slashes or regular slashes I don't know I only know that they're backslash it because that you hear people say it that way like just look it looks like a forward slash to me like if it was the fall it would fall forward but who knows maybe if it was a whatever the [ __ ] the plan in ep VanCamp calm that's th e PLA and the EP VanCamp calm I recommend that that he's got a video [ __ ] I can't remember off the top of my head with his name of the song for the video was but that [ __ ] was dope a man miracle who I've met a few times out there in Vienna one of the [ __ ] best places in the entire world that I've ever been that's miracle with the K by the way Mir a que le his music is dope and even more importantly he's a real cool dude so go check that out shout to Raul justice bonny L Cody from San Francisco who recommends the rapper a 1 I've had a couple of people recommend a 1 by the way Francis s CJ r Aaron the violinist sup Aaron will Oh Fernando P B Willis Nathan si speaking of Aaron the violinist who did once did a podcast jingle shout out once again to Lucas from Ohio for the acoustic jingle then I once again played the beginning this show I love that [ __ ] where am i Fernando P B Willis when IB Willis Nathan C Pierre L from Canada Thomas aka Steve T Spencer Scobie Marco from Canada TJ l John P from spot so bent Spotsylvania Virginia who loves Dale Firebird I had a little email convo with John P about Dale Firebird Dale Firebird is actually one of my least successful things that I've done on YouTube it's one of my favorite things to do and one of the least successful and often I think with artists yeah [ __ ] artists man like the [ __ ] that you really like to do isn't necessarily what people like to respond to the most and I think with Dale Firebird it's just like you know people don't not everybody knows that character you know that the whole redneck I talked about this on the podcast before but like they're like the redneck character is lost on most people not most people but a lot of people because you kind of have to grow up with people like that to really understand it like if you just see it on TV you just you just have like the wrong idea of what a redneck is you know if you're from my area you know what I would I like to use the example of is if you're from where I'm from there's a lot of rednecks and like what do they have like yeah like you know out in in Los Angeles there's a lot of Mexicans and there's a lot of cholos for example Joe this is a good comparison will be understood like if you're from where I'm from like you're the only thing you really know about cholos is what you've seen on TV and what you've like heard from [ __ ] maybe rap music and and just mostly movies and [ __ ] and uh you can't necessarily really relate to the characters because you didn't grow up with those types of people so people in LA often don't give a [ __ ] about Dale Firebird or if they or does not really understand like the humanity behind Dale Firebird if that makes sense it's not just like this stereotype there's real real people behind these rednecks you know I'm saying and and you know a lot of in a lot of ways I'm a redneck myself you know and I think a lot of us are at heart you know we like you know if you listen to country music lyrics [ __ ] there's there's a lot of things that I agree with what they say you know like this the simple things like there's that song by the Zac Brown Band where he's like for the first half of the course he's talking about just a little chicken-fried cold beer on Friday night pair of jeans fit just right yeah my radio when the second verse he goes into some [ __ ] about like like mothers chop the love of a precious child he's talking about how just like the good the good things in life are the simple things like drinking beer tea and chicken and the love he has for his kids and [ __ ] and you know I for one I can I can appreciate those things you know if I now if I go to a bar in areas around my hometown and you happen to run into one of those guys and he might say some of that stuff you can appreciate it but then if he follows that up by calling barack obama the n-word you know you might not be able to appreciate that so much so just because somebody thinks one thing that you agree with they might think something else that you heavily disagree with i remember an experience i had where I was in a bar and people were [ __ ] saying some crazy racist [ __ ] about Barack Obama and I was I couldn't even [ __ ] believe it but uh yeah that's a redneck for you yeah I'm not saying I agree with everything that everybody says and I'm not saying that all rednecks a racist but you know even a claw even what is it even o'clock broken clocks right twice a day yeah Alfons el from Canada mando from LA MattyB from Baltimore Nathan C and of course Joanna s in Dublin one of my favorite listeners always making me smile let's see what do I got okay let's start with Hasan ka ka Saddam and saying keep in mind this is this is a little this is a little bit maybe a month old but this is it's a Saddam insane very frequent listener frequent emailer and he was the person who originally said that I would use the word Pacific instead of specific so here he goes what up Mike been a while since I emailed but just had to respond to that damn spooby Raul s for calling me out last week spooby is a reference to a t-rex joke I'm sorry I'm gonna be having t-rex on the podcast real soon y'all he was supposed to be on this week but a probably on next week for those people have been asking for t-rex to come back first off I'd like to publicly semi apologize to you in the podcast listeners oh yeah I was so infuriated by Raul's chest Raul's challenge that I said [ __ ] it and thought I'd finally go back and drown myself and your beautiful voice for a week after listening to about 16 podcasts I've had a hit my ears are literally now full of Wax insert punchline drumroll but I'm dumb I've had enough of your god-awful voice and given up just playing your voices right but seriously whilst on the quest to find the infamous wack specific instead of specific slip-up I became deeply immersed in the pleasures of the podcast and forgot about the task at hand after hours of listening it is deeply saddening that I have to inform you and the podcast listeners that in fact I may have been wrong and you didn't actually say Pacific instead of specific you don't know how good this makes me feel Saddam and saying I was sure at the time that you said said it and I may have just missed it this time around but it looks like I may have just looks like I may have just told myself as Raul let's put it alas it wasn't a waste at 16 hours plus of my life I know one of your podcasts you mentioned a song called scrub life that you played to LA Reed when you met him at the Beverly Hills Hotel the scrub life mixtape was one of my personal favorites of your cat out of your catalogue and I was wondering have we heard that song under a different title or is it still unreleased I would love to hear it in fact its unreleased and if in fact its unreleased and again sorry to anyone who actually went back and tried to find the Pacific thing that teaches you for not believing for everything that you hear you damned spoo bees anyway thanks as always listening back to all those podcasts remind me just how dope it is that you interact with us your supporters on such a personal level level and can't wait for more music and more podcasts stay safe my friend you boy Hasan kay and Hasan k aka Saddam insane by the way low five blow dryer sounding tight yo well thank you very much Hasan it was good to hear from you Hasan is somebody I've met several times he's an English boy it was terrible but he's I've seen him in Philadelphia mm-hmm I believe I saw him in London but I definitely saw him in [ __ ] Amsterdam and uh yeah that's the homie I've also seen that fool in Paris man Hassan kay man Saddam insane he gets around a good friend good friend of the podcast and just good friend in general and also a good photographer by the way and he makes me feel good today by letting me know you and anybody that's been listening to the podcast for a long time know that I was a little bit upset because some so he said that I said pacifically instead of specifically and he said I said especially instead of a especially which I do i do say especially but I know that I don't say let me be Pacific about that I know that I don't say that so turns out I was right and as far as that song you're talking about scrub life I never did put that song that song yeah that's kind of funny that it was the ended up being the title of the mixtape and the title of the track I never got put out let me see if I can I can probably play a little bit of that for you here hold up [Music] [Music] that's right [Music] I don't need the clinseq lerigot I keep my spirit my standard swallow mine don'tyou don't call me so why [Music] right [Music] [ __ ] on the budget [Music] [Music] [Music] why [Music] stay home when is club night happily [Music] I try to fit Simon speaking for myself when I say the snow do we but I'm [ __ ] on myself I'm crying about my luggage give away to rubbish I own a bunch of rubbish in the do a bunch of is my last [ __ ] shrimpers real surprise sitting on the strip clubs in the still reserved I looked up into the sky and the lights feeling [Music] don't call me [Music] I said what is columbidae Napoli [Music] yeah so that's that that is that and now that was a rough mix of that song I never really like professionally got that mixed or even trying to professionally mix it myself but uh that was a rough mix sounds even a little corny to me right now honestly that's you know keep in mind it's like I guess that that album came out in 2011 so it's at least three years old that songs probably almost four years old and it sounds a little corny to me now I'm kind of kind of over that whole like trying to trying to be cool broke guy I don't think I was trying to be that but I think that that was naturally where I was at that time you know yeah I mean like if you're artists you kind of like just talk about you know and you like your music reflect on when your life is at the time you know and that's what I was doing at the time and it does have like a cool like rock Ozzie kind of vibe to it and I don't think I ever put there might be a live version of that song on YouTube I don't think I ever officially put that song out so thanks to the Saddam insane hasan k for asking about that i don't really know what else to say about it interesting all right this is from Louis B hey wax listening to your podcast with herbs listening to your podcast with herbs you mentioned doing ayahuasca and I've been researching it a lot and it seems interesting by researching I mean I watched a podcast and while your research is pretty much the same kind of research that I do although I did watch the the DMT documentary the Joe Rogan DMT documentary and I'm sure that if we're discussing ayahuasca the podcast and I remember you sent me the email with a link to it it was a Joe Rogan podcast he's one of those dudes that is very into like psychedelic drugs and he actually is the host of a whole documentary about the drug DMT which I just find that [ __ ] [ __ ] fascinating man like to me like the way that people talk about that it seems like more than a drug and you know I'm a I'm a believer in and true and not doubting everything you know there's people to think that might think he's crazy there's people that might think that doing ayahuasca this natural thing that you find in a tree and if you ingested supposedly according to people kind of takes you and shows you what God is and shows you where love comes from and shows you all these beings and [ __ ] like that and some people might think that's crazy but you know I think a virgin having God's baby is crazy as well so what can you say I think everybody's a little bit crazy and I do think that there's a I do think that there's merit in drugs I think there's merit in drugs especially the psychedelic drugs and I don't think that I don't judge people for participating in the experimentation of them or with them or whatever the [ __ ] if you ever have spare time peep it do you think you would actually make a trip to the Amazon rainforest if you were to try it all so completely random but what do you think of the Palmer Squares lyricism I think they both have amazing talent but I don't know [ __ ] about rapping so I'm curious what you think let me start by saying I think the Palmer squares are awesome I love them I love their [ __ ] and I think I think that they just got a cool vibe as far as ayahuasca I don't know that I want I don't know that I would make a trip to the rainforest to do that [ __ ] because to me that would freak me out even just to be down there would freak me out a little bit you know I'd be a little bit uncomfortable with my surroundings maybe and I might not know where I matter people might speak a different language I mean I know they had they have like weird kind of trips you can go on where you kind of like do ayahuasca with a shaman and [ __ ] like that I don't want to do it that bad and I don't think I'm that interested in it but you know if the shaman was here if he was like you know what how about instead of the rainforest would go to Malibu I'd do it like the rich white guy way although speaking of rich white guys I've heard that uh that the famous musician sting who is a rich white guy and you would think that he would he would being being with his going with his rich whiteness think that he would do ayahuasca in Malibu but maybe another aspect of being rich is you can kind of do whatever the [ __ ] you want and he wanted to go the Amazon rainforest and do that [ __ ] with a shaman and supposedly he's done that several times sting is a valid not valid avid sting is an avid drug like you know psychedelic drug user who supposedly does a lot of crazy drugs like him and his wife do [ __ ] Molly together and [ __ ] like that but I think his one of his big things is ayahuasca and I think several times he's been to the Amazon rainforest and done that [ __ ] with shamans and whatnot so uh you know it works for sting maybe that's where he got the name sting maybe that's like you know when he got out of it when he got out of the she got out of there you know there was some kind of naming the shaman caught him sting who knows but he's somebody that does that [ __ ] supposedly I don't think that I would make a trip to the Amazon rainforest to do ayahuasca no because I'd be too worried about something weird happening to me all right this next one this next question I remember getting this question this is kind of a weird question but uh read it anyway hey this is from Rachel hey wax big fan from New Zealand my [ __ ] stop for one second Oh what up alright sorry about that that's gonna Rachel big fan from New Zealand my name is Rachel I'm 16 and I'm a huge fan of everything you do your music your videos and podcasts I try to rap along do all your songs when they come on my phone I especially love new crack because it's so [ __ ] clever well I appreciate all that that you said Rachel that's awesome especially that you're so young and you're from New Zealand and you listen to all this stuff that's great my question for you is would you be weirded out or grossed out if you were hooking up with a girl and she took her clothes off and she had self harm scars on her body I have self harm scars on my stomach legs and hips and I get worried that when I eventually do end up having sex with someone and they see me naked that they'll be scared of the scars should I tell them about the scars before I get naked with them or should I not worry I don't actually want to have sex with anyone for a long time but I still think about what I should do a lot so yeah would that put you off the girl or would you really not care again huge fan of all your work and I don't mind if you read this out loud on the podcast since you said that that's why I decided to do it especially considering you're young and I don't know if this is [ __ ] illegal to even talk about this since you're a minor but I'm just trying to help and this is what I would say to you if somebody cares about that they will probably only care unless they're just a [ __ ] dick that you know and a lot of men are a lot of men just really you know you know what a lot of men want and that is sex and some of them might even tell you anything in order to get in bed with you but I think that ultimately first of all I'd be interested to see how [ __ ] how crazy the scars look because that's gonna make a big difference if you're if your stomach and legs and hips you know if it looks it's about to make a Kunta Kinte reference but I mean since I said I was about to I might as well have but if you if you're if it looks really bad then that might be a little bit different than the first a couple cuts there but I think that you're ultimately best off telling somebody ahead of time and maybe really not only telling somebody that you had the scars but explaining to them why you know you don't really explain in this letter why you have this these self harm scars or I think more importantly if that's something you still engage in and you still do still cut yourself that's not something that I ever did you know I've been I've had some depression in my life but I've never had I've never had that urge that's kind of something that I never did I never really got you know that's not really some something that I can understand - well that being said that makes me a perfect candidate to think about what I would say if I was the guy that was in the position you're talking about I think that I would just ask you I would just be honest with you and ask you you know what made you do that do you still and I just try to understand it with you and you know to be dead honest with you like most that's not gonna stop most guys from having sex with you if anything some of some of them might might even like it but uh I don't know you I don't know like I guess you gotta ask yourself how you feel about them you know I don't think that uh it's anything to be ashamed of I think that you should just just be honest and say that you had some had some issues and that's and that's what you did you know I think anybody that you want to be with especially if you're a virgin you've never had sex with the person the first person you had sex with should be somebody that you're able to be honest with you know I think I really do believe that I'm not just saying that to be nice to you I I really do believe that uh like I like I've said I talked about losing my virginity on the podcast to like I said was two weeks ago and I really am glad that it was with uh with with somebody that I at least you know you we were cool when I cared about you know and I wasn't just some strange one-night stand thing that I just want I just did to try to lose my virginity no I think it worked it works I think it's good to be with somebody who can be honest about and comfortable with and then if there is a weird experience it won't be so uncomfortable like you know like when I I mean this isn't the same as view but like I was I was uncomfortable in general and I was sweating my balls off and you know it wasn't as bad because the girl that the girl that I was with I wasn't worried about her judging me or anything like that it was just uh we were able to be honest with each other and I think the first person you have sex with you should be able to be able to do that too I think I think it I think another interesting thing about that if it's on your stomach legs and hips you know like if you're ever wear anything in the future especially if you're you know you're a girl that you kind of puts you out of the category of wearing anything revealing especially like a bikini or something like that and I'd be interested to see and they don't please please please sixteen-year-old girl do not send me pictures of your stomach legs and hips please don't do that but I would be interested to to know how bad it is or how you know if there if there's any potential for healing later in your life it's that's interesting but I wouldn't I don't think it's something I definitely see don't see there being any point in worrying about it you know I mean there's no really there's not really any point in worrying about it until you actually have that person that you might want to have sex with and then in that case I think I have a feeling that before you even have sex with them they'll they'll find out about the scars you know what I mean they might be doing a little something else you know I mean and or even if you're just talking to them and if you if you really get to know somebody and you get to the point where you're comfortable enough with somebody to let them have sex with you I think that you'll probably already be comfortable enough to let them know about that so that's what I got to say about that Rachel thanks for the email and thanks for listening to the podcast and the music alright this is from Harry 14 from NYC what's good Mike your music is generally tolerable to terrible and of course this is why I listen to your music and podcast well I appreciate that anyway in some of your songs you talk about God even though have you you have made it clear to us all that you were strongly opinion a strongly opinionated atheist and by the way I'm on your side the first thing that comes to mind is new and new crack where you say and the feeling in his wrist make you nod your fist make you realize God exists and then you go on to explain how splitting time up into such perfect increments as evidence for God's existence I don't know if I'm missing something or just that this just hasn't been explained yet but these questions need to be answered wax this little contradiction has been making me think for a while so I'm hoping your godliness can shed some light on the subject PS I'm sure all podcast listeners are very proud of your putting out a podcast on Wednesday for two consecutive weeks just thought that because your intros are often littered with apologies on how late you are with the podcast that you deserve credit where it is due have a great day and keep making music well I appreciate that Harry that that email was probably another email from about a month ago so since then I think I might have missed one but I know that this this podcast would yeah it should come out on a Wednesday if not it would be a Thursday morning but I did it will be at least the third consecutive week that I put out one so hey you know but as far as as far as the thing about god and new crack first the first of all let's start let's start with this it's you say you made it clear that you're a strongly opinionated atheist now going back to the pacifically verse specifically I think that if you were go back if you were to go back and listen to all my podcasts I don't think there'd be a time where I ever called myself an atheist I wouldn't call myself that I'm what they call a agnostic I think is what it is called I believe it's called an agnostic where if you ask me I don't know you know I don't know this is that my this is this is my belief as far as God goes summed up I think that I think I had to have set this on the podcast before but it's bait it can be summed up like this if you [ __ ] go if you look at an anthill an ant colony and then imagine those ants discussing the most recent NAFTA free trade agreement that Barack Obama made with the [ __ ] President of Mexico or whatever like if you just think about that think about the ability of those ants to have that knowledge that's what I think is is above us I don't know I don't know if there's God or whatever but I can I can tell you that I don't know you know I'm not perfect I'm not a politician I can flip-flop you know I don't know I don't know everything but there's something that happens with the music that makes everything change you know my opinions change when you have that there's there's a feeling that you get when you listen to music and a feeling you get especially insert certain times when it hits you in the right way that makes you know that that there's some kind of other [ __ ] going on and I think that maybe people feel that same feeling when they take ayahuasca and things like that but or you know it's the same the same reason people believe in God and they feel that in church and there's some kind of like unexplained thing that we might maybe we think it's God and maybe I thought maybe when I wrote those lyrics I was kind of thinking it was God and describing it as God but I really do think that there's something above us that makes it so we're able to split time into perfect increments like that there's some there's some kind of way that the world works in this perfect synchronized harmonious order you know it's the same reason there's 300 like there's 365 days in the year but that's divided up into seconds you know so there's blah blah blah seconds in a year and who the [ __ ] thought of that I don't know but you know there's some kind of way that we're able to just feel this division of time and what I mean by that is when you have you know if you let's say you have a B don't beat plan at 70 beats per minute you're not like thinking like okay well I have to clap 70 times for a minute you can just feel that exact rhythm and I don't know where that comes from maybe it comes from the fact that you have a heartbeat that's somewhat regular you know what I mean but at the time when I wrote that lyrics I I did those lyrics I was just thinking about that I guess and that that's the only the only way I can really explain it is there something above us that something higher than us that keeps everything moving in a in a specific pattern I don't know how to explain it but I definitely don't consider myself an atheist man I don't I don't I I I don't I don't go by the whole there's a [ __ ] dude in the clouds that looks down upon us and and knows about everything we do and he's just like us and I definitely don't think that he's good you know I think if anything I like to explain it all another ant metaphor is like imagine if imagine if you there was just a random kindergarten class and you can you made all of them take care of an ant farm you know it's just a random kindergarten class and in Wichita and you know we weird we're one of the we're one earth is one of those ant farms like why why couldn't that be true I mean have you seen how small and big things get you know like if the if it's true that the earth could be like you know if the universe is infinite if you've ever been on a beach and looked at one grain of sand you know if if that's earth I don't see why we couldn't it's unexplainable and we're too small to possibly imagine what's the what's real and what's above us but I reject the notion generally I definitely reject the notion that did any of the books explain it that's that to me is all is all nonsense I mean you know if you believe in it that's fine it's and I'm not I'm not gonna [ __ ] you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna judge you I mean I might kind of judge you I'm not let's be honest here I might kind of judge you for believing in these things wholeheartedly but I think I think the you know the reason that people do that is because you get to us you get to a certain point in your life you're like what the [ __ ] this is all this is all absurd this whole existence there's no meaning in life you know that's that's my that's my thing you know there was like a you know like what's-his-name cam you there was an old desert I think it was a French philosopher named Albert Camus hey learning something and his theory was absurd ISM and this really whenever everyone philosophers usually are trying to kind of figure out the meaning of life and that's what religion is trying to really point to as well and his main thing was there is no meaning of life essentially either you have to make your own meaning but if you really try to think of a meaning it's absolutely ridiculous like if you look at the world around you and the way we operate and what we're doing like to find a real meaning in it is ridiculous so I kind of go by that which which kind of makes me you know take it then it's it's it's a fun way to live your life if you think about it that way because it'll make you do more ridiculous things maybe and it makes you appreciate more ridiculous things and uh I don't know it's I don't I don't deny the existence of quote-unquote God but I definitely don't I definitely my point is I don't consider myself an atheist I do think that there's some kind of [ __ ] going on with the fact that we can make rhythm like that and there's a there's a feeling that you getting in music that I I can't explain it but there's like certain emotions explai it and when you connect with people I don't know that if there's some kind of connection we all have on this earth and I think ayahuasca probably brings that to the table you know there's all these little weird feelings I mean you can get even even like being in nature you know can give you can give you weird feelings about God in the meaning of life and all that [ __ ] so I don't know if I really answered anything through that but uh alright this is a pretty long email how much time do I got here I've been I've been talking for a while now but I told Trevor in Sacramento that I would read his email so I will sup big whacks I was just listening to podcast 53 where you gave advice to Eden or Enoch Young Eden or Young Enoch I don't remember who that was but sorry I forgot the name but the Jewish kid from Israel the guy that got all ran T about existentialism and religion I just wanted to tell you that I know what you were going through brace yourself for an excessive back story I'm a bit younger than you when the economy hit the atoh the toilet when the economy and when the economy hit the toilet I had just gotten on with the state of California working in Corrections and my girlfriend at the time I just graduated college and gotten a good job in accounting so we bought a house when they were cheap and I moved in solo because my girlfriend had old school Mexican parents who didn't want her leaving the house until she was married in that time I started passing time watching Netflix not shows mind you because those I had to save to watch with the lady so I started watching all the documentaries all right he said he would he wrote this at the time when I was watching all the documentaries and probably a lot of the podcast [ __ ] had to do with how depressing everything is pretty much the ones that you mentioned watching now I already knew the country was [ __ ] I knew it was big business buying politicians due to a family that always used to sit around and debate politics after dinners but those documentaries got me [ __ ] depressed being able to already realize how apathetic and Willey willfully ignorant our younger generations are when I started seeing just how bad it was made me realize that stuff is going to get bad hopefully after our life I [ __ ] couldn't agree with you more but I'm mentally ready to abandon ship the moment I feel the iceberg touched the boat and it makes me depressed because of the beauty that exists in how this country was created but not in the abomination that it has become I've dealt with the whole what's the point of life thing for a while mmm this actually led to in well from the previous question while I'm certain that there is no God as in some I'm nipa 10th dude picking Super Bowl winners as do it as I it's weird how this is and that this came after the other one I didn't plan this I don't discount that we could have a creator or creators they could be aliens I know it gets the lol's but I find alien intervention and shaping life on this planet far more likely than the aforementioned old guy on a cloud I must have got that from reading this or anything else so I think I bit your theory Trevor but I get the alien thing is actually kind of kind of goes along with what I said about the kids with the ant farm you know maybe maybe these [ __ ] maybe a maybe aliens are actually decide like one alien life-form is actually the size of 7 billion earths and of the earth to him is the size of a [ __ ] grain of sand or whatever you know you never know anyways my philosophy on what the meaning of life is and why I'm here is to be a good person you know be someone that makes existence better for other people rather than worse not to be selfish and just try to be happy and I will say that your music and the music of everyone I found through you dfd herbs intuition breezy Jose Rios zom all that great stuff that came through Knox Teddy is a big part of my staying happy and I thank you guys for that I've always loved music and always wanted to make music but unfortunately other than a moderately good singing voice I was not quote blessed with any abilities on that arena recommendation not sure exactly what to recommend because you usually oh you're using my recommendation to people but if you haven't listened their stuff slaughterhouse there's some of the best lyricist in the traditional rap game don't get too depressed man and if you need to stop watching those gloom and doom documentaries oh if you need to stop watching them and as far as the meaning of life just know that through your music you have made the lives of multiples of thousands of people better and take comfort in that for that long-ass boring email Trevor in Sacramento ah yeah I wanted to read that just because I [ __ ] I guess that I kind of wanted to read that because I as demonstrated by my answer to the previous question I kind of feel a lot of the same ways about things that Trevor does don't believe it not don't believe in the old guy on a cloud thing I don't that's that's funny I'm nipa tint dude picking Super Bowl winners that's funny [ __ ] cuz people think that they're like almost be [ __ ] uh God must bus think you know though they'll find anything to to bring God into and [Music] yeah I think that like like I said about life being kind of a kind of [ __ ] absurd you know music is one of the most absurd things there is you know and it doesn't make any any sense necessarily and it's totally subjective and it's just beats and rhythms and whatever you want to do but somehow it makes people happy and that's just you know when Trevor saying that my stuff makes him happy that's yeah I take comfort in that as well and that makes me want to make more of it and like I said in the beginning of the podcasts or the middle of podcast whatever that was I am making more of it and I'm gonna attempt to make even more and even more and even more of it and hopefully and won't be boring so hey that was a waxes podcast episode 61 kind of a longer episode but hey what can what kit what can you do you know what can you [ __ ] do what was the thing I was thinking about yeah I want cut to the chase I want to make it I want to make a skit where you that's that's like the premise is just cut to the chase like it's like a [ __ ] 1930s kind of gangster guy he's always cut to the chase but he just says it like like all the time like he's like spying something with 7-eleven 7-eleven guys bring ups cut to the chase what do I owe ya cut of the chase why it's just saying little conversations like he's just always so impatient that he has to say cut cut the chase but let me cut to the chase real quick and tell you be safe

you all are well now in today's lesson we're covering a song request and it is a very popular one Kabhi Kabhi Odyssey from the movie jaane tu ya Jaane na so I think this song is super popular and the up miss about sorry no Musa regularly requests currently that I should bring a detailed lesson on this song now guys if you are excited then you make sure that you like this lesson first because that is very important for me and if you are new to this channel please subscribe it as a first thing alright and once you're done with that you take on your uke tune it in standard tune and let's start with the lesson the guys is amazing song to play turning it up which I gave patch cords of Accords hand called G minor called C minor called B flat called B flat and called F now in case you already know how to play these cards then you can skip to the next part of this lesson and let's first learn how to play these chords so to play chord G minor you need to place your index finger on first fret first string your middle finger on the second fret third string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and called G minor should sound like this to play chord C minor you need to place your ring finger as a bar on string three to one over fret 3 and got C minor should sound like this to play called E flat you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 4th string and then you need to bar the other three strings with your ring finger like this and God 'flag should sound like this to play called b-flat you need to bar 1st fret with your index finger like this your middle finger on 2nd fret 3rd string and your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and called b-flat should sound like this to play chord F you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F should sound like this the guy's a bat contain strumming pattern key or it's song made hummus Grande Valley has strumming pattern with a Chuck stroke now I think me reports and lessons may I have explained you this pattern but again for all of you who are just watching this lesson for the first time strumming pattern or where the Chuck stroke means that you'll play one or two strokes and then you mute the strings with your hand okay like this so in this song we are using a very easy strumming pattern so you you'll play it like this down up down up down up up down Oh shucks so if you play this pattern on a particular chord then it would sound like this so down the guy's patterns are the masculine here occupies the squatch's a practice can I over different chords cookie Jessica John throw that chords are little bit difficult so try holding different chords like on B flat D flat C minor G minor and start strumming the strings C minor E flat D flat now guys let's talk about a melodies of this song so in this song I will try to explain you various melodies and when you play these melodies together with the strumming pattern you will get a very beautiful arrangement okay so the first melody which we're gonna discuss would be [Music] [Music] alright so you play this melody in the very first part okay and you start this song actually with this melody so you play this along with called G minor and called slim Winer okay so at one place you will play chord G minor like this [Music] and you merge this strumming pattern with this melody okay so it's melody co-player Nicola of course other question Agana you start with string - okay you hold string - on fifth fret like this and then you slide two four eight three so slide and then play it once then do it again then you play the same thing on string one so one string one you will add an extra tap like this so again very slowly [Music] [Music] so guys a bath got a melody - key or a melody to comply can engage in the mid section of this song so melody - would sound like this okay so up with Jana Carnahan you start with the third fret second string you played one then you go to string one wait and open version like this so Fred three string two dead string one in open string one in open position and then you play string one on fret 3 [Music] do it two times and then you do the same thing like you did for melody one okay so Fred five - Fred three slide [Music] alright so I'm sure you got the idea and how you can play these melodies the guys in Melody's koha music and violin had different different parts made so up Khmer song clip art manger B song play Kirk a the conga then I will be showing you over the screen like when you have to play rich melody and along with that I will be showing you over the screen like how many times you have to play your pattern on particular chords so that way you can relate things well and you can play this song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so guys I'm sure you must have liked this lesson please subscribe to guide and make sure you hit the bell icon and I'll see you next week with an amazing new lesson so until next time do take care and bye bye", "MkajqefUVeQ": "[Music] today I'm going to be teaching you how to play filthy frames we abou song it's a relatively simple song very good for beginners it's actually one of the first ones that I learned for this song you'll need the basic gcea tuning and the chords you'll need will be a F sharp minor E and D major seven you play them in that order with a relatively simple strumming and there's a slight pause between each chord you play them in the same progression the entire song it's just the same pattern it's relatively simple you just have to repeat that same pattern the entire song without change the real trick is trying to line up the lyrics which it's a little bit of effort to work with it requires a little bit of coordination [Music] it's getting from f-sharp minor to E which really trips me up every time I don't know if that's just a me thing or if it's like an everybody thing but I know that it's harder for me so you might want to practice going between the formation for f-sharp minor and it's just kind of like a coordination you pick it up over time but yeah the lyrics to fit with the song relatively smoothly if you practice it and it keeps going for the rest of the song it doesn't really change for any other part of the song it's literally one of the easiest songs you could learn so that concludes my video I hope you learned how to play this song if you didn't watch it again I recommend listening to the actual song which I will leave a link for on you", "WISo8dXEk5g": "[Music] I scream [Music] cool

strum of each phrase so it's gonna sound like this one two three four five six one two three four five six let's try that on the g major chord now we're going to learn the chord progression for this song and we're going to break it up into three sections the first section is going to be for the verse three chords and the solo instrumental the second section is going to be for the courses and the third section is going to be for the bridge so the chord progression for the first section which again we said is for the verses pre-chorus and the solo instrumental is just going to be G for 12 beats a minor for 12 beats C for 12 beats and D for 12 beats let's try playing for that chord progression now by bringing out each chord one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and now let's add the strumming pattern with that chord progression one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight and in truth now the chord progression for the second section which is just for the courses is just going to be e minor for six beats C for six beats G for six beats and D for six beats let's play for that chord progression now 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and now let's add the strumming pattern to that chord progression and last the chord progression for the 3rd section which is for the bridge is just gonna be G for three beats D for three beats a minor for three beats back to D for three beats c4 six beats and D for six beats let's try playing for that core progression now by ringing out each chord 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and every time you play that bridge you're gonna ring out the D chord at the end of the phrase let's add the strumming pattern now to that chord progression 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 now that we know our chord progressions and strumming pattern was put together with lyrics and play through perfect I found love me doesn't just dive right in and follow me I found a girl beautiful and sweet I never knew you learn that

of the e string finger number 2 on the second fret of the g string take your thumb pluck the open C string now strum on all of the strings to play the F chord release the pointer finger for an open e then replace it back to the first fret now pluck the open a string from here take finger number 1 put it one closer to your toes for a c7 chord but the melody line is right here on the third fret so I'm gonna take finger number 3 and place it on the 3rd fret of the E string now middle finger goes to the second fret back to the 3rd fret open a string back to the F chord now keep your finger here 1st fret of the E string open a string 3rd fret now here's the melody line but we're going to form a mini B flat chord like this so it's like a G shape if you're familiar with the ukulele but we're going to be sliding all the way to the fifth fret and the sixth fret avoid the g string because it's not in the chord that's not kind of cool though but I would avoid it then pluck the fifth fret again of the a string so just keep your fingers here now go back to the F chord but there's a melody line right here for the third fret of the a string because that's the melody line open a twice first fret now c7 with third fret 1st fret third fret open a third fret now here we have a D minor you're going to take your focus box fingers two and three place that on the second fret of the G in the C string then finger number one is on the first fret of the E string leave the a open strum down keep your fingers here because we're at the second fret of the C string pluck that twice then we release release the ring finger right in position for an F [Applause] [Music] next part is very similar to the previous part we have pinky on the fifth fret F chord with the third fret pinky open a first fret c7 with a third fret 1st fret third fret pinky to the fifth F with the third fret open a third fret B flat with that G shape on the fifth and the sixth fret pluck the fifth fret again F chord with a third fret open first fret C seven first and third open a and the third fret so you notice my fingers did not move we have our D minor second fret and we strum that F chord to hold and that's it that's everything that you need to know in order to play an easy finger style version of Anglais sign if you want to see how it all fits together stick around for the play along [Music]

guys and it's pure imagination by jean or gina wilder but i'll be doing the version of angelo javier so a lot of you guys have been requesting me to teach the song since this song is kind of popular on tiktok but before we start the tutorial let's have a quick shout out so shout out to john rain malabanan abigail agustin michaela marita mayo marla sophia elaine karigma lady vince mamalias cheese stick erika skye oncast kyla nick and lastly shout out to jeliko lami so thank you so much guys so for today's tutorial i'll be using my c mui ukulele from clifton guitars and if you're interested with this instrument you may check out the purchase link on the description box below so in order to play this song you need to learn five chords on the ukulele and the first chord that you need to learn is the chord of d minor and it looks like this one index finger middle and fourth okay so this is d minor now the next chord is a minor seven and this is the easiest chord to play on the ukulele because you don't have to put any finger on the fretboard you just have to strum it as it is so this is a minor seven now the third chord is f major seven but we're going to do the alternative of f major seven in which you're going to put your index finger and your middle finger here on the g and c string fifth fret okay so again this is f major seven and our fourth chord is the chord of e flat diminished and it looks like a g chord but you need to start here on the g string down to the e string in the second fret so one two and three okay so this is e flat diminished and lastly we have the chord of b flat major seven and it looks like an e minor so one two and three so let's review so we have d minor a minor seven f major seven e flat diminish and b flat major seven now for the first part of the song you just need to strum once per chord and just sound like this one by the way please forgive me because this song doesn't fit my range is kinda low so yeah please bear with me come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination take a look and you'll see into your imagination okay let's repeat one two three go come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination take a look and you'll see into your imagination so if the key of the song is kinda low for you then you need to clip a couple um maybe here on the first fret or second fret that depends upon you so yeah now the next part of the song is blocking now our plucking pattern uh looks like this one need to plug the g string followed by the c string e string okay so g c e and then after that one you need to pluck uh your a string and your g string together okay then after that one you need to tap okay g c e g and a and tap [Music] okay and we're going to follow the chords on this part will begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation what we'll see will and then after that one for the last two chords of this part which is the word explanation now we have two chords for that we have f major seven and e flat diminish and close and open parenthesis so that means you need to strum that part so one and two and then just repeat okay now let's do it again we'll begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation what [Music] so as i have said earlier if you're not comfortable with the key or the pitch of the song then you can clip a capo somewhere here on the second third or fourth fret so that it traces the pitch now for me i'm gonna try the third fret okay so one two three four five come with me and you'll be in a world of your imagination take a look and you'll see into your [Music] imagination will begin with the space traveling in the world of my creation what we'll see will defy [Music] explanation [Music] so that's it for a tutorial today guys i hope that

"hi guys welcome back to my channel with me ria today i'm going to teach you how to play wishlist by txt you should really listen to this song in the morning okay because it will pump your morning these are the cards that we need to know to play the first feel free to skip ahead if you already know the fingering position to play c chord take our tiny finger and place it on the third fret first string next we go f so middle finger goes to the second fret fourth string index finger goes to the first fret second string and then a minor so just let go of our index finger leaving our middle here a minor simply the strumming pattern that we're going to play in this song is pretty much the same throughout the entire song we need to do it like this [Music] like that so we're going to play using that pattern in the first and the chorus in the intro we're still going to play something like that but simpler so in the intro we need to do please tell me now [Music] just that so just play c and f then we go straight to the first okay [Music] [Music] though the pre-chorus is a little bit different we have two new chords to play d minor we need to take our index finger place it on the first fret second string our middle finger goes to the second fret fourth string and our ring finger just below the middle finger [Music] and then next chord is g middle finger on the second fret first string index finger on second fret third string and a ring finger on the third fret second string [Music] so now we're going to play d minor and g for the pre-chorus okay after the pre-chorus we go to the chorus which is the same like how we played the first okay so i'm going to start playing from the pre-chorus until the chorus okay [Music] oh [Music] oh yes i now say please tell me now so we and mute okay so we look at my right hand and this side of our hand just blocks it okay the second first is the same also so let's just play along with the lyrics i'm so excited i love this song so much

third and hopefully final cut in the video because I had to keep moving around to record in different sections for different reasons and I'm editing together so there shouldn't be a gap but that's why I'm wearing different shirts and stuff in different parts of you know whatever also I implore you to go and see my cover of this song this is home by cavetown it is on my channel before you watch this because that will be the version of the song that I'm teaching to you it's not the official like way to do it because I got lazy at the end and I like improvised my own thing and you know so go listen to it first and if you like that then come back here and I'll teach it to you okay okay cool now honored the video oh my phone is dying also I'm Sebastian here's my channel here I am we're doing ukulele stuff again surprise surprise so a little birdie told me that you guys want to know how to play this is home by cave town so I'm gonna show you okay so you're going to need quite a few chords for the song you're gonna need c 7g e minor c c minor if you already know chords you can go ahead and skip ahead but if you don't I'm gonna teach them to you so it's okay C seven it's going to be the first one you're gonna need which is your first finger on the bottom string second fret C seven will sound like this which as you can tell is the very beginning of the song after that you're going to need C minor which is your first finger barring the bottom three strings on the third fret hold it all the way down C minor will sound like this and then you're gonna need G your first finger on the third string second fret your second finger on the first string second fret and your third finger on the second string third fret and G should sound like this some children want to go outside and play and so they're being loud over there so I came over here to finish and I mean I barely started so we just went over G so after that we are going to need a minor just going to be your first finger on the first string 2nd fret your second finger on the second string third fret and your third finger on the third string fourth fret and an E minor should sound like this you're going to need a C or this this one but I'm not flipping you off love you guys second finger on the first string third fret and SE sounds like this now that that's out of the way we can move on to the chord progression which for the beginning of the song the verse is going to be c7 C minor G so it's and it's going to go down down switch down down down down down up down down up editing me you need to figure out how to put that on the screen because it's that's hella complicated okay okay that's gonna repeat for the entirety of the verse but you're going to do that chord progression two times and then start singing the verse so playing that chord progression together slowly c7 C minor [Music] G [Music] I had a small a downstroke on the very end of that I do that sometimes and it's okay you can add your own flair to the song if you want to make it your own so in tempo with the words it's gonna sound like this boys stress falling sick right now I'm ready flies out of here that's the end of the verse and when the chorus comes up you're going to want to do a minor C and then G with the same strumming pattern so it keeps it easy I need to stop doing this in the chord progression for the chorus slowly you can play along and rewind as many times as you need to get it right [Music] just like that playing the chorus up to tempo with the words it's going to sound a little something like this [Music] I'll hide my chest [Music] and then it is the same chord progression but instead of using words you do that please so don't mind that voice crack and it gonna sound like it but and it's gonna sound like this well after the shrunken spy it gonna sound like this handcart lordy the road is busy today he's going something like this [Music] [Music] [Music] after you have the first verse and chorus down then you have the second verse and chorus down as well because there's ten chords and same progressions but different words so here's the second verse turn off your porcelain face I didn't really think right now in this please there's too many colors enough to drive all of us and say are you dead sometimes I think I'm dead cuz I can feel the ghosts and ghouls wrap in my head but I don't wanna fall asleep just yet the second chorus comes in and you've got the same chord progressions and everything but in front of the words on the second chorus at the beginning you're going to put the O's there instead of after it so while you're playing the chords at the beginning you immediately start going ooh so that's gonna sound something like this [Music] my eyes went dark [Music] I don't know where [Music] my pupils are to figure out a way to get us out the next part of the song comes after the second course or it is a part of the second course I'm not entirely sure but the chords in the progression and the strumming all stay the same as he goes he doesn't know how his mind is in a different place with everybody please give him a little space get a load of this train ride Sarah's a mess and he doesn't know okay so after that this is the part where I majorly improvise because there's a finger-picking and if you want that there's other videos that can teach you but I didn't learn it so here's the easy way out you just tap and you're going to take the same chords as before a minor C and G but you're just going to strum once and then tap and then tap and then change and then strum once and then tap and then tap change repeat and then the last line with no audio behind it because it sounds dramatic and echo Ian and stuff and it's cool so that is gonna sound like this tracing his face but strangely he feels it home in this place and tah-dah you have it congratulations you just learned this is home by cave town the easy version because I was too lazy to learn the hard version and it was also one of the first songs I learned so I wasn't experienced enough to want to do the finger-picking part like I said if you think that you're a bit more experienced or more advanced than the song was then go right ahead and learn the finger-picking part congrats to you if you can do that because um that is hard so good luck happy playing comment down below that was a whole hand comment down below any songs that you'd like to see me do or any other videos that you'd like because I'd be more than happy to oblige but alike if you like this video and make sure to

me from start to finish also i'm gonna be playing the new enya soprano ukulele in this video there's more information down below on that as well so we're gonna be learning this song in a different key from the original but if you want to play along with the original you just have to put your capo on the second fret we have seven chords in the song and they're all down here if you already know them then feel free to skip ahead our first chord is c you're just going to put your third finger on the third fret of the first string and here's c [Music] then we have f you're gonna put your first finger on the first fret of the second string and your second finger on the second fret of the fourth string here's f [Music] then we have a minor you're gonna just put your second finger on the second fret of the fourth string here's a minor [Music] then we have g you'll put your first finger on the second fret of the third string second finger on the second fret of the first string and your third finger on the third fret of the second string here's g [Music] then we have d you'll put your first finger on the second fret of the fourth string second finger on the second fret of the third string and your third finger on the second fret of the second string here's d [Music] then we have a you're gonna put your first finger on the first fret of the third string and second finger on the second fret of the fourth string here's a and then we have b minor i'm going to show you two different ways to play b minor the first way is the easy way you're just gonna put your first finger on the second fret of the third string second finger on the second fret of the second string and your third finger on the second fret of the first string and you're going to avoid playing this top string so you're just gonna play these three there's b minor and then the second way is the bar chord you're gonna bar the whole second fret with your first finger and i like to use the second finger to also help press down these strings and then you're gonna put your third finger on the fourth fret of the fourth string so here's the bar chord version [Music] and those are all the chords for the strumming pattern we're going to be doing down down up up down up on each chord and that's going to happen for almost the whole song here's what that sounds like on c we have down down up up down up and then there's a couple places where we're gonna do a different strumming pattern but i'm gonna show that to you when we get to those spots so first we're gonna learn how to play the verse our chord progression is down here we're gonna be playing two bars of c then two on f then two on a minor [Music] one on f and one on g so let's put in our strumming pattern we're doing one strumming pattern on each chord so it sounds like this we have c now f now a minor [Music] back to f and now g [Music] and that progression happens two times all together for the verse so now here it is all the way through with the words i'm standing there [Music] [Applause] [Music] little did i know now we're going to learn how to play the pre-chorus and the first part of our chord progression is down below we're going to start with f then we have g [Music] then a minor and then c so let's try with the strum we have one strumming pattern on each chord so first we have f [Music] then g a minor and c [Music] then the next half of the progression is almost the same we just have a g chord on the end instead of a c chord and that dash next to the g chord means that we're going to strum just one time on that chord so here's the second half of the progression we have f g a minor and then one strum on g [Music] so now here's the pre-chorus all the way through with the were words you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from julia and i was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go [Music] now we're going to learn how to play the chorus we have a new chord progression down below we're going to start with two bars of c [Music] then we have two bars of g then two bars of a minor [Music] one bar of f one bar of g and then we're going to end on c [Music] so now here it is with the strumming pattern we have c now g now a minor and f g and c [Music] so now here's the chorus with the words romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all there's left to do [Music] i'll is the princess it's a love story baby just stay yes now we're going to learn the bridge and here's where we're gonna do some different strumming patterns our first part of the progression is down below and we have those dashes next to all the chords so we're just gonna do one strum on each chord so starting out we have the a minor chord then f then c and then g that gets played two times all together and then for the second half of the bridge we're gonna play the same progression that we had in the chorus but this time we're going to be doing all down strums on the chords so we have down down down down down down down on each chord and then on the last g chord we're just gonna do five downs so down down down down down and then we'll mute the strings so here's what the second half sounds like with the strum we have c c again now g g again now a minor and again then f and g and mute so now here's the bridge all the way through with the words i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around my faith in you was fading [Music] when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said only you'll save me i've been feeling so alone i keep waiting for you but you never come as this in the head i don't know what to think he knelt to the ground and put out a ring and said now we're to the last sections we're at the final chorus and the outro here we go into new key so we have a new chord progression we have two bars of d [Music] then two bars of a then two bars of b minor then one bar of g and one bar of a and then on the second time through the progression we're going to have two bars of g at the end instead of g and a and then we'll finish on a d chord and we're going to go back to that down down up up down up strum that we had before so

thought i would come do a uke lesson so this is kind of a rough translation of my guitar lesson so if you're curious go check out the guitar lesson and you'll see where this came from what we're going to do is uh just start with your middle finger and your ring finger you're going to set your middle finger on the third fret of the third string ring finger third fret of the second string now i'm doing uh just assigning my fingers to the string so i'm assigning my thumb to the fourth string index to third string middle finger to second string and ring finger to first string although we don't use the first string at all in this song so we're going to do is take your index and your middle finger over here and you're going to pluck those strings twice and you're going to set your index finger back here ring finger comes off index finger comes back to first fret of the second string so you've got all right now the next chord what we're gonna do is see where your middle finger is there on that third fret of the third string hop it up to third fret of the fourth string and then add your ring finger to third fret of the second string all right and now i'm going to use my thumb and my middle finger all right so you just pluck each of those simultaneously then drop your index finger back to first fret uh ring finger comes off again uh drop your index finger back to first fret of the second string now are you going to pluck with your thumb and middle again those are the signed strings fingers to those strings so you're going to pluck those then you're going to set your pinky down here on the fifth fret of the fourth string pluck that singularly then you're going to pluck again and slide up to seven so [Music] all right and then the final chord index finger first fret of second string middle finger second fret of fourth string and two plucks there so from that last chord [Music] all right so let's take a look at it try to play through it slow a couple times so

here again with a ukulele tutorial for uh juice world's lucid dreams uh one of my favorite songs of all time and i've been waiting a while to do this one just to because i just didn't have the time but uh now that you know uh my rugrats are back in school uh i've got a little bit more time so i'll be be bringing more ukulele tutorials to you just let me know uh in the comments below what uh tutorials you want done and uh make sure to like and subscribe while you're doing that all right lucid dreams is uh is a great song um to kind of either do as a picking kind of thing you can go like a little no [Music] you can do something like that um but i'm gonna show you kind of both ways that i would do it um so we're gonna we're gonna first go over each chord that you need uh and then i'll go over strumming and or picking patterns so your first chord here 6654 [Music] uh and i believe that's an f sharp minor okay six six five four so two fingers on this the first two strings are on the sixth fret and then fifth fret fourth fret right uh and then next we're gonna go six four four four so you're just basically going to bar that fourth fret and put a finger on the sixth fret g string [Music] okay then you're just gonna slide that down two frets [Music] to four four four two two two sorry and then your last chord for this little piece is one one one four basically a c sharp right so you put your bar in that first fret and then you're gonna put a finger on that fourth fret uh what is that a string okay so if we were to do just this part so starting back at 6654 i'm gonna go for strumming i'm gonna go down up up and then switch chords down up up and then for the third chord i'm going to go down up up up and then that last chord just down all right so again six six five four down up up then six four four four down up up then four two two two down up up okay or you can go down up up up down and then down right so i'll do it without talking this time down right if you wanted to pick that part i would i would really focus on the the c e and a strings so you can plug c and a together and then c e a and then do it again and then do it again you know so cna are really going to be your drivers for this [Music] okay so that's your main that's your meat and potatoes of the song right so it's the i still see the shadows in my room can take back the love that i gave you right so uh when you get to the easier said than done it's gonna change a little bit we're going to go to d easier said than done right so 2 2 2 0 easier said than done we're going to go 4 4 4 2 which is an e set then done i thought you were the one a were the one um listening to my heart in stead of my head so this last chord is very similar to the beginning chord but it's different right it's six five four four instead of six six five four okay so this part here you're going d easier e7 [Music] uh then that's gonna be uh f sharp instead of my head and i go back to d easier e said then and then you could uh for this last part you could go back up here just to six four four four and then and then you're going to go back into the beginning part i still see the shadows in my room right so um so the court you know the course part or that i guess the change part it's gonna be d down up up e down up up a down up up and then uh f sharp down and you could stay on a if you wanted to or you can come back up here again okay super duper easy song um if you're still doing the picking part in the chorus you're still doing the you're still doing c c a c and a together and then c e a so so c so c c and c and a together okay sorry c and a together c e a and that'll be that'll be your your picking pattern for pretty much the whole song all right uh cool hopefully this video helped you out give

say put your flip-flops back on and get a Hawaiian shirt cuz you're ready for cruise ship Giddings a lot of people think this song promotes drinking and driving but it's not supposed to be like that it's supposed to be one of those like if life gives you lemons you make lemonade type of songs and even if Lane gave you a 12-pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade this song is so simple you could still play it while driving a car or while riding a bike so this song there's only three chords a major which is five seven seven six five five and tabs just a standard major Barre chord which is one of the most common course to use for acoustic guitar players such as myself and yourself I use that chord all the time and so do other professional experts so that's the first chord you got to know the second chord you got to know is D five seven seven seven starting on the a string and then what the other one is that same chords formation up here on e seven nine nine on a string seven D string nine g string nine B string so it's just for the only gonna sing and the rest of the song that was the insurer are than the rest of the song the core changes never change just like I do in most of my acoustic songs the right hand is just creating a drum beat using the bass note and the cord and that's the whole thing that's two wheels I forgot to mention there is a turnaround that happens in that song everyone swap so it's just cause you already learned and then this is seven five four on the a string and then seven five on the E string bah bah dah dah dah they say rock and roll is just three chords man and that's all this song is three chords two wheels one heart a bunch of veins they bleed rock and roll man you cut my veins I open a bunch of Dave Grohl's just pile out let me know in the

Archana Covadonga cap Casablanca Zegna is a very famous song Gina Gina on your ukulele [Music] okay me so with all respect take out your uke no check if it's in standard tune and let's start the lesson [Music] so nice it's so completely clear approaching each our chords our chords and ROTC called a minor good F and chord G and the Roco already called Spada have speakers at the lesson k next part way otherwise let's first learn how to play these chords now to play chords see you have to place your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and cut see the sound like this to play chord a minor you need to place your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and what a minor will sound like this to play God f you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and a middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called s will sound like this to play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret 3rd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 3rd fret 2nd string and what G will sound like this so friends now let's learn the strumming of this song this song has a little tricky strumming as it's a distorted one but the pattern what we use in this songs is down up down up down down up down up down down up down up down uptown so less distorted stomach means that the struming breaks while playing two chords and the pattern remains the same so what I mean by that is when you play a chord C and F then when you hold curtsy you play down and then you switch the chord to chord F and you play the rest of the pattern so it's down so when you play both call together it sound like down up down up down now you will be using this distorted strumming in intro and the worst part now when you want to chorus this distorted strumming will be played in one chord manner so in chorus if I play chord C then I will use the full stomach pattern on that chord it's like down up down down up down up down down up down up down up down up down down don't don't up

this can be very useful for somebody who doesn't want to spend money outside and wants to do it at home and wants to learn how to do it at home because it is very very simple and it's not as hard as you think it is I just need to make a couple of disclaimers so I am NOT a licensed aesthetician I am NOT a professional in this field whatsoever this is just a knowledge that I've built up over the years and things that I know about waxing and stuff that has been working for me and the safest way that I know how to do it so if you're going to be using my demo and my advice then please just keep that in mind that I am NOT a professional so please do your own research or just get it done by a professional but this is for people who want to do it I don't want to learn how to do it at home because it is totally totally doable at home also there is one very important thing that you guys should know you should not expose your wax skin to direct sunlight for at least 3 to 4 days because it will burn it will irritate it will burn it won't be a good mix at all that is something very very strongly advised by every aesthetician by all the professionals and stuff like that a couple things that you guys should know is that after you're done waxing that's going to be like these red bumps and you guys are probably gonna freak out when you see it in the video but that's totally normal it's going to come down within like a day or so and especially like by the second and third day it's gonna be completely gone it's definitely not something to panic about so if you see it just know that it's normal and that's gonna go away also when your we have freshly waxed you want to wear something that's a little bit looser so wear leggings or like a very light shirt or something like that nothing that is still constrictive so yeah you just want to wear things that are loose and that will be airy and you're gonna want it trust me because for like a day or two it's gonna feel if you like touch it a little bit or if you like rub the area it's gonna be a little bit I don't want to say like a burning feeling but kind of like a burning feeling so for the rest of this video I'm going to be doing a voiceover please please please pay attention very carefully to avoid any mishaps or anything that's gonna go wrong because you definitely don't want to play with hot wax and you want to do it as safely as possible so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this video and I will see you in my next one okay so the first step is to gently exfoliate this will help prevent ingrown hairs and of course eliminate dead skin cells by the way huge emphasis on the gentle exfoliation I'm using this lush bar and it's called Buffy it works really really well step two is to of course heat up your soft wax in a wax warmer so I'm using both the GG all-purpose honey wax and the wax warmer that it comes with this one works best for me so the way you know it's all done heating up is the consistency looking like this it should be thick it should not be liquidy because that would mean it's super super hot and it has potential to burn or even rip your skin off and because this is soft wax we have to be using waxing strips so this is the muslin waxing strips I've tried many other waxing strips and these work the best for me another huge disclaimer if this is your personal wax double dipping is fine but please do not double-dip if you are a professional or you're working in a salon and you're working with multiple people it's just unhygenic okay so now that we got that out of the way step three is to patch test an area before going all in the wax should not be burning your skin or should just feel warm so all you have to do is apply the wax in the direction of hair growth so if your hair is growing vertically apply it vertically laying it down if it's growing in a diagonal way which sometimes does and you will see that in the next couple of Clips things we're going to be applying the wax in a diagonal weight as well so after you've applied your wax applied a strip over top rub it in really well then pull in the opposite direction okay growth hold your skin taut if needed to avoid bruising and then it should look something like this also you may use the same strip as many sections as you see fit however I don't go pass through three poles in the same strip because it increases the chances of bruising so it's all up to you guys and what feels best for you so in this example you can see that my hair growth is more on the diagonal side it's going towards the right so I'm going to be laying it just in the way that it's growing and I'm also going to be lying down the strip in that way and pulling it as well if you don't do this and you just do it straight ahead and a vertical align then you're going to increase your chances of having ingrown hairs and you definitely don't want that so just follow the direction of your hair growth by the way if it doesn't pull the hair entirely do not go over it again with blacks because you will either bruise your skin or it'll rip your skin off so try not to do that instead just take a tweezer after you're all done and just tweeze that area so that you can avoid all that mess [Music] I find that the knee area is one of the worst places to wax because this is an area that you can easily bruise in or rip your skin off so I just applied the wax as normal while my knee was still slightly bended up I pulled my skin taut and then I pulled the wax so this is the best way I find that doesn't rip my skin off so yeah definitely be careful in the area [Music] [Music] now you can see them just tweezing the leftover hair that has the mane and then I put some coconut oil right after finishing and I'm gonna use a small towel just to remove any of the wax because this is a soft wax it's not just gonna come off in the shower like hard wax wood so you're gonna have to rub it off otherwise it's gonna stay there for days and this is the final result so this is what it looked like immediately after these red dots that you see will go away in about two days so it'll be a lot better by the next day so it's completely normal do not panic [Music] this is about three hours after I've lakhs right before I went to bed I filmed this on my iPhone with flash so that's what that looks like and this is the next morning it has completely calmed down and of course by the third and fourth day it was really gone that's it for my video I will be listing everything I used in this video down below I hope you guys found this very very helpful please give it a like subscribe to my channel for more videos and I'll see you next time [Music]", "nOVZFOmkbQY": "hi guys welcome to Yuki guide today we will learn the very popular song Delia

and we'll be covering the very melodious song will be Purva by petit go hard so take out your uke now junior ukulele in standard and let's start with the lesson so nice to play the song you need four chords and these cards are called C called F chord G and called F minor now to play chord C you need to place your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and Godsey will sound like this to play chord F you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F will sound like this to play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret third string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and chord G will sound like this to play chord F minor you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 4th string your middle finger on 1st fret 2nd string and your little finger on 3rd fret 4th string and got F minor will sound like this so guys let's talk about strumming pattern in this song we are using a common strumming pattern that is down up down up down up down up down up down up down up down up so guys down up down up is the basic pattern however when we are using this pattern in the song we are using it in a different way so for that what you have to do you have to play a Down stroke like this and then you have to play all three strokes immediately like this so when you will play it together it will sound like okay so down a little delay and then up down up so you will start with chord C and you'll play this pattern two times there like this and then you'll move to other chord so if we go to court F then you have to again play this pattern two times then you go to court see then you go to court G so that's how you play the first part of this song so you do the same thing in chorus as well you play this pattern two times on each chord except chord F minor and called F okay so when you reach the point when you have to play called F and chord F minor then you have to play this pattern once so there's this song has a very beautiful intro part as well and that is majorly on guitar and I have customized it on ukulele so now I'm going to teach you that so for that what you have to do you have to use three chords mostly and the chords are called C called F and chord G okay so you should be comfortable with the positions of all these three chords so now let me explain you the first part now in first part you have to play strings in open position so you will use string for string three and string - okay so you'll play these three strings together like this now make sure that you should not touch the string one okay you have to leave it alone you don't have to touch it so you just need to play top three strings together like this and then you have to play string two and three like this okay then you have to add your index finger like this [Music] okay you are adding it on first fret second string and then you have to play string two in open position like this and then you go to string three and play it again in open position okay so this piece will be played on chord C so when you'll play together it will sound like this [Music] so in part two we'll be using called F so use position of called F like this okay now you have this from top three strings and then you have to play string two and three so string 2 then string three let's play - then strain three and then against and two and then you have to play string 2 on third fret with with the help of your ring finger and then you again remove you then you remove this finger and then you play string 2 on first fret and then you play it in open position ok so when you play together it will sound like then again you have to do the same part what we play it for called C so you will again play it like this [Music] right now you'll go to court G so that is part three so you hold the position of called G and then you have to strum top three strings again like this okay you strum it like this once and then you play string two and three like this so two three two three two and then you go to string one this time okay this time we need to add string one and you play string one two and three together so when you'll play it all together it will sound like this [Music] so let's start playing the song [Music] Oh son [Applause] the Sun Java mother [Music] [Music] cold-cut

[Music] do [Music] and um i also have a very exciting announcement of a giveaway winner to share with you all but i'll leave that for a little bit later in the episode so you may notice that i'm wearing my glasses today it's been a pretty busy sunday already and i didn't get a chance to put my contacts in so i hope the glare from the lights isn't too bad on these if during editing i realize that it is terrible then i'll make sure i don't wear my glasses again but it is um like i said quite a busy day today and i've sort of been running around and hadn't had a chance to think about putting them in so this is what i look like usually day to day the contacts only really come out for special occasions and i figure um podcasts are a pretty special occasion so that's why i normally wear them and also to make sure the glare isn't terrible during the episode you can find me on instagram as fibrebound and i am on ravelry as alipay now that i've jabbered at you for way too long let's get into the knitting okay so finished object i have two for you today and i am really happy with both of them um one has been a finished object for a couple of weeks but seeing as i haven't recorded for a while that's why you haven't seen it and i will show that to you first as it's probably no surprise to anyone who's been here before i've finished my february socks and here they are so here they are they're my desert vista die works socks i'm participating in the monthly knit along with desert mr dye works my february color is called somebody loves you and it's a four-strike repeat that was very valentine's day inspired i cast on 56 stitches for my socks i knit them on a 2.25 millimeter or a us-1 needle i like knitting them in magic loop on chow goo needles for this particular pair i did a true afterthought heel and i'm really happy with how they matched up quite perfectly there and i follow the kirby worby tutorial kirby webbians kirby webby tutorial on youtube that i'll link below if you wanted to check that out i think she explains it so well that it's really easy to get your head around it and to follow that tutorial so these are my february socks i absolutely love these the base is the vizzo base it's a 75 percent merino wool 25 nylon i think i have that right i usually show the tag and the tags been put away now but yes i'm really happy with them i haven't worn them yet i thought i'd wait until i show them on the podcast before i do but these are my first finished object and i'm so happy with how they've turned out they're my first socks for myself for this year as well so that's very exciting my second finished object today is a crochet project this is the first crochet project that i have finished in over a year i did start one around this time last year but it's actually not done yet so i started this on the 1st of march and i finished it on the 12th of march so it was a super quick project and i really enjoyed working on this one it is a test crochet or test i'm used to saying test knit um it's a test project for a crochet designer that i really admire gianna reached out to me because i've let her know i've tested for her before and i've let her know i was keen to test for her again and she reached out to me to see if i was free to do a test for her at the end of february and i jumped at the chance it's so fun to test patterns for designers and it's so such an honor to be asked to test a pattern for someone so i was very excited when gianna asked me to do that gianna is from little red knits on instagram and on ravelry as well i will link her down below now this pattern actually comes out later in the week and i'm planning to release this episode towards the end of the week so it should be fine for me to show it it was a bit of a secret test we were asked not to share any photos until the week of the release so you haven't seen any of this on instagram until i start posting this week sometime but it was an amazingly fun project and let me show you what it is now so it's pretty long but it's essentially a rectangular shawl or a scarf it is called the rosewood wrap and it is so lovely i would put it on but i think i'll disturb the microphone um i will be taking some finished object photos of these over the next couple of days so i'll try to insert some photos i think my light is blowing out the colorway a little bit but this is kobu by lion brand it is in the colorway called terracotta and you can see here this beautiful texture that is worked into the shawl this pattern is written for true or with true boo yarn by lion brand unfortunately i couldn't get any trouble in a timely manner here in australia nowhere that i could sort of find locally stocks at so i found kobu instead which is a cotton bamboo blend and giana was happy for me to use that as an alternative so this is uh made up in a dk weight and this particular yarn i've got a label here actually and the leftovers is kobu by lion brand it's a cotton bamboo blend um 51 cotton 49 rayon from bamboo 232 yards or 212 meters per hundred gram gram ball and it's a dk weight in the colorway terracotta given that this yarn is obviously a different makeup to what the original pattern was designed in i i assume that if it was made in true boo true boo yes it would be much more drapier but having said that this is blocked out beautifully i might pop a photo in of before blocking and and show you that but this is um it's just become very airy and pretty after blocking i can't wait to wear it and this is all i have left from three balls of that yarn i had a little bit of a issue with the yarn actually when i first ordered it i accidentally only ordered two balls and when i went back to order it once it arrived they had sold out so i had to find a different supplier to send me a third ball of this so i had a little bit of a concern that i might run or into a dialogue issue and luckily the one that arrived from my second supplier was exactly the same dye lot and there is no problem with it at all i was very very happy when i opened up that package it was very exciting now to let you know about this pattern itself it's a two row repeat it's a paid it will be a paid for pattern and if it's released by the time i post this i will link that down below for you it's written for a four millimeter or a g hook i did a gauge swatch and i needed to size down to neat gauge i'm mainly a knitter i don't crochet very regularly so i think that getting into the groove of the crochet maybe took me a little while and when i was first uh swatching um the four millimeter hook was that the pattern is written for was much too loose for me so i went down to a 3.5 and then down to a three and i still found on my swatch with the three millimeter um i was a little bit looser than and then anticipated but gianna gave me the go ahead to get started and so i started and cast on now i also know that i have a tendency to make my foundation chain quite tight given that i'm not that experienced with crochet so i did do my foundation chain with the four millimeter hook just to make sure that it didn't cinch in at the edge too much or at all in the end and that worked really well so i did the foundation chain with the four millimeter and then went in with the three millimeter from uh the setup row through to the rest of the pattern what i found while i was crocheting this i got about a third through the pattern repeats um a third of the way through the pattern repeats and i met gage it was perfect and so i was very happy with that all of a sudden i was on gauge on track very excited but then we went away last weekend and i was crocheting every spare minute to try to get this done there was obviously a bit of a timeline limit or limitation that i had to meet to make sure i have the notes ready for gianna in time for her to release this pattern so i was crocheting like a bit of a mad woman to try to get it done and somehow got much tighter while we were away on holiday and i was crocheting on this so my gauge changed slightly halfway through um and i definitely got a little bit tighter but um tried to sort of loosen that up towards the end again and just kept to the three millimeter hook but was conscious to not be so um anxious to get it done and just enjoy the process and honestly that second week of working on this i enjoyed every single stitch the first week was a little stressful for me because again not a crochet as a day today so trying to meet that deadline was a little bit of pressure but once i got through that weekend and came home that second week just it flew this absolutely flew off the hook and i really enjoyed making this so i'm really happy with how it worked out really happy how it blocked out i did have to quite aggressively block it to make sure it was consistent all the way through and to open up this lovely texture as well and i'm really happy with how even it all looks after blocking so this is my first crochet project for 2021 started and finished in less than two weeks so i'm very happy with that i'm really looking forward to wearing this now that it's starting to cool down though to be honest it hasn't really been all that warm this summer and i will probably get wear out of it over the next few days and i can't wait to wear it and enjoy the finished item lost for words how is that possible those are my finished objects just the two of them today so let's move on to my works in progress i have a few works in progress to show you today i obviously spent a lot of time on that test crochet project that i spoke about just now which took me away from a lot of the works in progress i had shown in previous episodes and didn't quite get a chance to complete those items as quickly as i thought i would so a few of them didn't get any love at all over the last couple of weeks but i will show you the things that have had some attention so the first one is living in my project bag by the knitting dentist so i've shown this one before this is a bag that was gifted to me last year by christa it's a drawstring bag and i in particular want to show you this because a bit tangled up in there because krista is about to launch her online shop um so i will link her instagram page down below so you can follow her along and see when she launches that it is coming very soon i've spoken about this before but i think i'll just recap for anyone who's new here because there are a few new faces around welcome again uh so krista my knitting best friend who lives in colorado in the united states um and i started and it's along together for our birthdays last november and we decided to work on the drifter shawl by tammy gore with yarn that we had sent to each other as gifts so krista sent me some beautiful yarn by explorer knits and fibres she sent me the denali sock base it's an 80 superwash merino 20 nylon there are 400 yards per 100 grams and she sent me the colorways roma and trustevia if you've watched in the past you'll see that these are getting smaller and smaller they are really beautiful colors i love how they look together and it's a beautiful yarn to work with okay and i'll show you the actual project now because i have made a little bit of progress on it since i shared it last i don't think i showed it last episode i think it was two episodes ago but where that little wine stitch marker is that's where it was last time i showed you and so as you can see the rows are pretty long so a little bit of time has gone into this and i am still on the final section of this shawl or of this pattern i'm about halfway through that section and if i sat down and worked on it with a little bit more focus i could get this done very quickly but i've been kind of pushed in other directions the last few weeks so haven't had a chance to pick it up much apart from getting that little bit of progress in before all the tests knitting and crocheting started but i'm really happy with how this is turning out i really love the look of this shawl so far and i'm so excited to have it finished to be able to wear christa and i actually had a zoom catch up this morning and we sort of spoke about both getting distracted and not finishing it yet but we we're not actually in a rush to finish it either it's a really lovely project the pattern itself is so easy to pick up where you left off um and it's a real pleasure to knit you really feel like you're progressing when you spend time on it and you don't feel like you're spending a lot of time on it to get some progress happening which is always fun in a project for me that there is also some variation in the stitch patterns along the way which is good to keep sort of interest rather than just garter the whole way through there's a little bit of in there are a few interesting rows that break that up though really do enjoy the gada simplicity um and the squishiness of that fabric too so i have i have really realized that i do like knitting garter a lot more than i thought i did there are going to be a lot of cuts in this episode i'm feeling so rusty so this is my first work in progress the oldest one that i'll show today um and i absolutely adore this and theoretically i could be finished with it by the next episode but i'm not going to make any promises because as we all know knitting happens distraction happens so let's move on to the next whip okay my next whip is uh being housed in this lovely project bag by nickrate i talked about this in the last episode as well so it's a lovely canvas bag with a gorgeous print on the front and in here if you watched last time you may recognize the little cub baby raglan i was knitting on last time so last time i only had a bit of the yolk done but i've actually finished the body now here's a progress keeper to show you where i was last time so i had just done this top part i hadn't joined it in the round yet i don't think or if i had it was only very just joined in the round that's not focusing sorry so yes that's where i was at the last episode so i did put a bit of work into it not a whole lot because this is a very very quick knit but i finished the body and i just have the two baby sleeves to go and i've got them on hold on my little chow goo short interchangeable needle set ready to pick up the stitches for the arms i have marked with stitch markers here where the buttons will go based on where these little button holes are i did adjust the buttonhole in the pattern a little bit just to match the um the rib that goes along here so that i did make a slight modification there it is a paid for pattern though so i won't go into too much detail but i have really enjoyed this pattern it'll be a lovely gift for my friend who is expecting her first baby in april and i think i'll be done in time for the baby to be born so i can post it to her she has now finished up work but i'll post it to her once it's finished now i haven't talked about the yarn or the needles the yarn is a baby soft acrylic yarn it's from a local big box store called lincraft here in australia it is in the color stone it is a hundred percent acrylic and there are 274 meters per ball approximately now this is a dk weight yarn which i spoke about before which is probably actually bordering on sport now that i think about it and look at the meter ridge in this ball um and i'm knitting it at the same gauge that is written into the pattern and that is uh written for a fingering weight yarn so i seem to be getting gauge with this on the recommended needle sizes and i am using or have used for the hem a four millimeter actually let's check let's check what sizes i used because there were there are three different needle sizes listed for this pattern okay so i used a four millimeter for the body and a 3.75 for the bottom ribbing i believe i think that's right so the 3.75 is a us5 and the 4 millimeter is a us6 um but i'm ready to pick up the sleeves as soon as i finish some important other knitting that i'll talk about next my third work in progress ah my i was gonna say february it is not february anymore then my march socks for the desert vista die works knit along that i'm participating in now the desert vista die works knit along is the seventh annual desert vista die works monthly sock club i'll remember that without thinking so much by the end of the year and the aim of this is to knit a pair of socks in desert vista die works yarns each month so you start on the first of the month and your aim is to finish by the end of that month so this month's colorway actually i'll show you the tags this is the desert vista die works tag this month's colorway is called somebody lavender d comp and i'll show you that in just a second actually here it is and i've chosen a speckled yarn for this month and i adore this yarn i chose this yarn for a couple of reasons one i felt like a change from the self striping my last two months worth of socks were both self-striping and i thought let's mix it up a little bit and i had this in my stash and the other reason is the green content i struggle to make decisions sometimes and the way that i will decide on colors for something especially like socks if i'm doing them regularly or any sort of knitter long items is by theming things so for me march is the month of saint patrick's day and i can't say that i celebrate st patrick's day i'm just aware that it's on the 17th of march and why i remember that i don't know but march to me is saint patrick's day and so i figured the green bits in here which from back here probably don't look so green but when i'm looking at it close up i see a lot of that green coming through not sure if the camera is picking it up but you can see the little green bits there i thought it made the decision for me a little bit easier so i am on the first stop currently i cast this on on the first of march i always try to cast on on the first of the month and i completed the cuff and there it is and i've just finished the heel turn well the heel flap heel turn and the gusset stitches and i'm now on the foot as of this morning i cast on 56 stitches on a 2.25 millimeter or us-1 needle needle i did a 2x2 rib on the cuff which is my preferred cuff and i did that for 20 rows and now i'm just knitting down i think i got to about 50 rows before i started the heel flap whoops and these little light bulb stitch markers are marking every 10 rows which will allow me to make sure i match up the second sock without having to count each time it's a bit of a visual reference for me and i did a heel flap a slip stitch heel flap and heel turn and just finished the gusset stitches this morning as i've said now given that it is the 14th of march already i feel like we're almost halfway through the month and i should be finished with one sock by now but like i said there were some distracting projects this month that have taken up a lot more time which means that this hasn't had a lot of love but my aim is to finish this first sock today um i do find that once i put an aim for myself or a goal i tend to be able to get things done a lot quicker and i'm participating in a bit of a challenge that's on instagram today which will be well well and truly over by the time this video goes up but i might put the hashtag on the screen so you can check out the progress to see if i've met the challenge and um yeah the aim is to finish one stock by the end of this weekend now it is 2 30 p.m on sunday do you think i can do it we shall see i'm hoping that i can but we'll see so yes my aim is to complete the pair by the end of the month but i would like to get at least the first one done today so it's off of my needles and i can start the second one before mid month comes along or passes too quickly so that is fo sorry no fo so that is my third whip for this episode that i've actually been working on and i just have one more to show you now which is a pretty exciting one for me actually my final work in progress is in a bag that was sent to me by my friend christa the knitting dentist who i mentioned earlier and it's a test knit i might talk about the yarn first i'm using the vitilana aloft yarn in the colorway tiger lily the yarn is a merino 48 mourinho 20 baby alpaca 32 organic cotton dk weight 274 yards per 100 grams and it's really soft really super soft so i applied to test knit with uh chantel from nititude thinking that i was probably a little bit too late but i still wanted her to be aware that i'm still keen to test it for her and really did like the pattern that she had shown and thought oh that would be lovely to have in my wardrobe but wasn't expecting to be picked because i had also just agreed to test for gianna at the same time but i was picked and i'm so excited to test for chantel again i have tested for her before i think it was the confetti crop top that i tested for her just over a year ago i want to say almost two years ago but yeah i was very excited when she sent me the email that i'd been selected to test for her and so i'm testing the new pattern called the botanical tea uh by chantel of nillitude and here is my progress so far it's um coming along so this is the front here is the detail hopefully that's focused okay has a lovely panel of lace down the center of the front this design is worked from the bottom up so you cast on here at the bottom and you work your way up in the round until you split for the sleeves so i've split for the sleeves i've almost finished the front panel so i'm knitting that flat now from about this point here oh that's a little blown out and then i will i've got the stitches for the back on hold on the needle and i will start knitting on the back panel once the front panel is done there's a lovely eyelet detail here in the back and i'm really enjoying this knit i feel like i haven't put that much time into it but i've made a lot of progress it's just flying off the needles for me the pattern is written for a five millimeter needle needle a us8 i'm actually i actually had to size up quite a lot with my needles to meet chantel's gauge and i'm knitting mine on a us 10.5 or a 6.5 millimeter needle which is probably why it's flying by so quickly because it is it is a very large needle that it's being knit on but i am loving this so i am on i think row 11 of 12 here in the repeat of my second to last repeat so i have stitch markers here indicating each repeat start now they're just some extra ones there hanging on but this is a really enjoyable knit probably about that much left to go before i bind off the front and i'm hoping to bind that off today and get a start on the back which will be a quick knit now this will be a paid for pattern i believe it's being released in the second half of march um i need to get notes to chantel by friday the 19th of march i think that's friday and i will have that ready for her by then this has been really fast to get to this point and i only started it maybe a week and a half ago not that long ago i've been working on this concurrently with the crochet project that i showed earlier and i feel like i've really progressed quite quickly with it which is amazing for a garment so if you're up for a quick springtime knit if you're in the northern hemisphere or for us in the southern hemisphere this will be perfect for autumn um this is an amazing pattern i really highly recommend it it's been such a fun knit and just flying off the needles so i think i've said everything i needed to say about that let me check my notes quickly yep that sounds like it's about it but no highly recommend this one when it comes out you need to check it out i'll link what i can down below for you certainly my project pages will all be linked for you on ravelry i try to keep some good notes there in case you ever have any questions about anything or if i've forgotten to mention something about a particular work in progress or finished object i do recommend you have a look at the project pages on ravelry i'll always list yarn details how much i've used the needles i use and any relevant notes that are relevant to that pattern or that project so those are all of my works in progress for this week now i might move on to announcing our giveaway winner so in the last episode i decided to do a giveaway with this yarn by fiber lily which is an australian who is an australian yarn dyer in the colorway am i only dreaming it is such a fun bright color and it just gives me so much joy and this yarn is a fingering weight yarn it is a 75 it is a 75 superfine australian superwash merino 25 nylon and it is 390 meters or 426 yards per 100 grams and the speckles are so pretty and the colors are just delicious now i'm pairing this yarn with this lovely project bag that i got through nick one of my knitcrate subscription boxes and it says yarn squad on it it's just a drawstring bag that's like a bit of a backpack i got two of these in two separate crates so i thought it would be fun to share one with one of you lovely viewers before i started recording i went onto a youtube comment picker a random comment picker and we chose a winner for this lovely giveaway and i ended up taking a photo of the winner's details so the winner was a beer or is abeer al-quatan and i am so sorry if i've mispronounced that the comment that a beer left on my last episode's comments was that her favorite thing to knit is color work sweaters and there are always two at a time socks on her needles so a beer i will ask you to there's the photo of the winning account a beer i'm so

i'm so excited to do my first giveaway okay so i thought i'd now move on to my acquisitions if you're interested in acquisitions then please hang around if you're not interested in acquisitions or life things that i'll talk about later which i don't have that much i don't think to say though these episodes tend to go longer than i ever expect um then thank you for watching today thank you for joining me it has been a pleasure to be able to spend some time with you and i hope that you're having an amazing day so i'll move on to acquisitions now now i have a few acquisitions for you today a few things that were ordered over the last few months and have taken a while to get here and so let's get started okay so my first acquisition is an order that i placed with the wool warehouse sometime in january i think and i had forgotten what i'd ordered when i spoke about this during the last episode but i ordered very specifically samyang to make something for my husband and as well as i had cast on a pair of socks at the end of january that i wanted some heels toes and cuff yarn for i ended up ordering the drops fable in two colourways and i have these two so unfortunately there aren't any names on the labels um they're just colors so it's color 300 and color 300 is the brown and 100 is the cream these are a fingering weight yarn they are 75 wool 25 nylon or it says polyamide but i believe that is still nylon and oops i ordered the brown to make my husband a birthday gift with so i have two of those and as i said the white's going into heels toes and cuffs for another project as well this yarn is actually super soft it's really lovely i'm a bit sensitive to scratchy walls and there is nothing in this that wouldn't make us suitable for me for next to skin wear so i'm really happy with this and i'll be ordering more of this in the future because it's a really lovely feeling yarn i can't wait to see how it knits up so i will be making my husband's gloves with this i did make a decision if you watch the last episode you would remember that i was confused about what to make with which yarn for him so i've decided to make his gloves with this yarn the pattern that i found is actually written for this yarn or with this yarn so i thought that would be good to do that with the suggested yarn and i had actually been so confused with uh which one which yarn to use for what with my husband i ended up asking him and i let him make the choice and he decided that the um the knick krait yarn that i showed in the last episode would make great socks and he wanted his gloves out of this so happy to oblige that's what's going to happen it took that decision out of my mind because i was very undecided about it apparently i'm a bit of an indecisive person this yarn is very affordable it's got a great price point i can't remember how much i paid for it but it was super affordable and when i put it in my cart and went to to check out with these three balls the shipping was actually dearer than the three balls so i decided that i needed to order some more yarn to make the shipping worthwhile and what i did find was that they also stocked drops kids silk mohair so i ended up getting a few balls of this i actually got two four six balls of this not with a specific project in mind but knowing that um there are a few things like i like a cloud cardigan i'm also really interested in casting on a love note at some stage and i figured if i just got some natural kid mohair silk i i can use it for whatever i choose to um so just to let you know this is 75 percent mohair 25 silk it's a 25 gram ball and there are 210 meters in 25 grams here so super soft this is the first time i've had kids silk my hair by drops i've only ever used um indie diamo hair before and gorgeous this is really lovely i can see why this is very popular it's at a great price point as well so that was a great purchase and the other great thing about this purchase is that the order came in this lovely organza bag so i'm at the moment just storing this all in here and i just thought that was great bit of packaging there rather than it being wrapped in plastic it was just a little bit more sustainable i'll be able to get some use out of this bag so that is my first purchase that arrived this month or this last few weeks and my second purchase is a project bag so i love project bags if you haven't been able to tell and i like to match my project bags with my project if i can um so i'm always on the hunt for a new project bag even though i would like to make them but i just don't have the time at the moment or the location to be able to set up a sewing machine and actually be able to sew them so i went on to etsy and i found the woolly tangle and ordered this gorgeous bag it's just a sock project bag it's got gorgeous little llamas on it and a cute little handle and the maker is the woolly tangle i don't know if that's on the right side yep same on both sides so it's the woolly tangle on etsy i'll link the shop down below and i actually ordered a progress a little llama progress keeper to go with this but it wasn't in the package and the lovely owner of the shop i think her name is tanya um has sent that in the post to me once we communicated about that so the customer service has been phenomenal and this came quite quickly considering i ordered it from the uk and the price was really really good too especially the shipping costs i find if i order something from canada or the uk um and even europe the shipping's pretty reasonable i think i paid 12 for shipping of this which isn't terrible i'm really happy with this i can't wait to um put a project in here i'm actually thinking i might might use it for now for maybe my husband's socks or maybe his gloves that i'm planning to knit for him and yeah i just think it's super cute it's got a lovely square bottom and i'm looking forward to using this my next acquisition there are a few this week um like i said they've been ordered over a period of time and just they happened to come in all at once my next acquisition is the next installment of my rosehip island yarn club so hannah from rosehip island is doing a yarn club which is the fairy sorry it's a t yarn club and this month's is the fairy garden tea party and when i opened this package i was just so happy these these colors just made me very happy so the yarn club comes with a main a main scheme of yarn so this is the delicious sock base it's an 85 australian superwash merino 15 nylon 400 meters per hundred grams and this is called fairy queen and it comes with two minis so the first mini is called viola and the second mini is called morning jew and they are all so pretty let's see if i can focus in just such a beautiful set really really like these colors so this yarn came with um another tea that i've just reached for now so this month's tea is a berries and cream tea i haven't actually tried it yet but i'm really looking forward to trying it it's um vanilla bean and sweet vanilla flavored teas with freeze-dried blackcurrant strawberries elderberries blackberries and hibiscus blossoms wow i cannot wait to brew this so i might do that once this episode is finished once i finished filming but that's the tea that came with this one and again another little special that came special little extra that came with it was this gorgeous tin i love pretty pretty little things and this is no exception and in here i've got the progress keeper that came in this month's club and it's a little fairy actually it's not a progress keeper it's a stitch marker let's see if that will focus there very cute thank you so much hannah i absolutely love installment number two of your yarn club and again no idea what i'll make with this it's so pretty and it may end up as socks it may end up as a shawl um absolutely love these colors they're really really gorgeous another thing that came in the mail this month was my next desert vista die works order now desert vista die works are based in america um i don't know if it's texas i can't remember exactly where in america i might pop it on the screen if i look it up when i'm editing but i find if i order three skeins the shipping cost stays consistent whether i order one or three and it's just more economical for me to order more in one order rather than fewer and making more orders if that makes sense so i ordered these in january i think i think it was january and i ordered three skeins so so the first one is called wine tasting it's a self-striping yarn with beautiful tones of wine so from white wine through to grapes of red wine it's really beautiful these are all on the vizzo base which is 75 superwash merino 25 nylon so that's the first one the second one is called i'll just date myself this one is tones of pinks and there's a grey in there again it's another self striping yarn i love the vibrance of these colorways i just find that the colors are just so gorgeous the photos on the website actually don't do them justice when i see them in real life i just i'm amazed by the beauty of them and the final one is called early autumn now this one is another variegated it's not self striping and i thought it was timely seeing as we're heading in well we are in autumn now here in australia and i just really think this is a gorgeous pretty colorway it's got speckles of yellow green lovely coral in there a bit of darker colors it's really really gorgeous i'm really happy with all three of these so there they all are my desert vista die works a haul for this month okay now i just wanted to give a shout out to a shop um now i obviously mentioned that when i was making this rosewood wrap i had to order yarn for this so this was an acquisition as well but obviously it's already been made into something which is always a fun acquisition when you've used it up before you've had a chance to show it but i did want to shout out uh the um shop that i got the second or my final ball from that was one that i forgot to order in my first order now the shop is called yarn me calm it's an australian small seller but they sent this one ball of yarn that i ordered through them in this beautiful bag again another shop that just blew me away with their packaging so yarn me come there's the logo there i was very happy to find this site when i was googling um just that kobu yarn to see where where i could get some more from and they had some in stock and more than just having it in stock they had the exact same uh die lot that i needed which i thought was perfect and then they packaged it in this amazing bag which again is another drawstring i think yep yep so it's another drawstring bag that i think is just a great way to package an order i'll definitely be ordering from them again and i'll link the shop down below or the website down below i don't think it's etsy i think it's an actual website so um very impressed by this company that i've only just found and the fact that they stock um yarns like kobu lion brand here in australia is brilliant too and they had such a huge range of colorways available there so not sponsored not paid to say anything here i'm just really quite impressed by the thought that went into this packaging thing as i only ordered one ball from them now my final acquisition is not yarn um it's uh what do you call it when you go on a holiday and you bring something back to remember your holiday by wow words are not friends right now so we went away camping last weekend and i wanted to get something to remember the trip by so we went to there aren't many shops where we went there's literally a post office a pub and a corner store and the last day we were there we just popped into the post office to have a look in there they had some gift choppy things in there as well and i was really surprised to see some knitting needles i didn't see any yarn and if i had seen yarn i would have bought it i did see some already handmade items there were some hats and scarves that they were selling that people must have made locally but they sold some knitting needles and i bought them purely because they're super cute and they will look really nice in my little little knitting needle holder up here and here they are they are tiny little knitting needles they're a 2.25 millimeter bamboo needle and i just thought they were super cute i decided to or to buy this pair in particular because i looked at them and went oh they look like a 2.25 and i actually did find the size in teeny tiny little etching right there i might see if i can get a photo and insert it and it is a 2.25 millimeter and that is my preferred sock needle size i don't knit on straight needles but i think they're very cute so they will just be added to my little display up here after i finish recording today but they're so tiny you probably won't see them but i just thought i'd mention it i just thought they were super cute okay so the final thing i guess to say i'm gonna grab my coffee it's been on my heating mat that i showed in the last episode so it's nice and warm still and i'll just finish off with some life things there aren't really many to share with you but i thought i'd just check in with you and just share what's been happening the last few weeks seeing as it has been three weeks since i last spoke with you so the blanket that i showed in the last episode for my sister has been gifted i popped in that afternoon i think or the next day and the next day after i recorded and dropped it off to her and she loved it so that was really exciting in the process it turned out well after about a week i guess she messaged me and said yes i do watch your podcast so it is good that you didn't mention it in previous episodes so that that was good to know make sure that if i'm making something for her i don't talk about it until it's ready to be given to her um so that was really nice to be able to gift that to her after putting that together and what else have we done um a couple of weekends ago we rearranged the boys bedrooms my sister like i said was moving into her new home so we were able to get one of the desks that she had that they didn't need for their new home and my older son has that desk in his room now but to get it in there we had to rearrange both of their bedrooms to move some furniture around so that took up a little bit of time a couple of weeks ago but that was lovely it was a great opportunity to do a bit of a deep clean of their rooms and that's something that as they get older i like them to be more involved in but sometimes it's just nice to get in there and do things my way and make sure i get in and get things cleaned the other thing that sort of happened last friday my workplace celebrated international women's day and i went to a [Music] talk we would usually do a breakfast but during covert times that was cancelled and there was a morning tea served and a talk with some of our inspirational women leaders of south australia it was really inspirational to hear them speak i really did enjoy that day i was also nominated by a colleague for helping out with some major things at the end of last year when we were shut down during covert so that was a real honour to be nominated for recognition on that day especially when you're working with such amazing people and such amazing women all around your workplace uh that was a real honor and really lovely there were a lot of nominations this past year so normally they nominate just a small number of people but they opened it up to the whole workplace community this year so there were around a hundred nominations so out of possibly around a thousand to two thousand female employees in the workplace that's that's a huge honor to be recognized for the work that you do um last weekend we went camping i might insert some footage of that trip at the end of this episode just to show you what we got up to um i did most of that crochet on my test crochet project on that trip and it was just such an enjoyable weekend away we had bought some canoes from some friends a couple of weeks beforehand so it was great to take the canoes out on the water and we had the kids bikes there so the kids went for bike rides and it was lovely to spend the time just relaxing and spending time with the family and some friends as well that came along with us we had an absolute ball and just really cherish that time away together um and that brings us to this weekend so this weekend's been a pretty busy one i guess um i've done all the housework a lot of laundry we had a very rainy dreary day yesterday so it was a nice day to stay inside today my mum will be coming over and we're going to spend some time knitting together over coffee which i always enjoy so i'm really looking forward to that and uh this week brings with i guess more work and nothing really else i don't think i think i've covered all of it now uh thank you so much for watching i really do appreciate it i will wrap this up now i think i've been talking for a long time i will be recording probably in another three weeks again next weekend is quite hectic which would be my usual pod recording weekend but we've got some things happening next weekend so about three weeks until the next episode will be released and i want to thank you again for spending some time with me it is so wonderful that you are here and you choose to spend your precious time listening to me talk about my knitting i'd love to hear what you're working on i've gained so much inspiration from the comments over the last few episodes someone mentioned the s summer simple summer sweater by hohilo catelli that i'm really eyeing off as a possible future cast on with samyang that i showed in the previous episode so thank you so much for that comment i'm pretty sure i responded to you and with the comments i do try to respond as soon as i possibly can to you all i do apologize if sometimes that takes me a few days to get to you but i will respond to you in due course i certainly read every single one very quickly and i'm always so touched that you have taken the time to write me a comment and let me know what you're up to or what you're working on so yes what are you working on today what have you been uh knitting while we while i've been talking with you um i'd love to know it's so fun to share the projects that we make and the inspiration to create i got lost for words again so thank you so much for tuning in i will see you in a few weeks i hope you have a lovely rest of day and a very nitty time if that is what you like to do and i will see you again soon do [Music] [Music] [Music] well [Music] you", "scKFtPfGyNU": "[Music] well hey does that sound familiar to you maybe you've slow danced to it or given a smooch to the one you love on the new year that is called auld lang syne song of the new year and I'm gonna teach you how to play it today we're gonna do a single note melody version of the song that will follow what the words are so I thought it'd be cool to kind of do something a little bit different here as we bring in 2020 or maybe you're watching this in 2023 and we can do that too so without further ado let's check out auld lang syne so we're gonna break this into three sections I'll play them and then I'll show you how to play it so before you do anything go to all four you calm print out the tab for this full version they'll also be a tab section by section below but I promise it'll help you and I'll give you the correct fingers to use which is of utmost importance so let me play you the first section and then I'll teach you how to play it so the first section starts like this [Music] now what I'm doing here with my strumming hand is I'm grabbing underneath the body of the uke and then with my thumb that's how I'm doing all of the single note plucking here so everything you hear me doing with my strumming hand is just happening with a Down pluck with my thumb and with my left hand we're doing all of these single notes here so the way I like to approach a melody is I like to allocate one finger to a fret so I kind of take a look at the whole piece of music I see where my fingers are gonna have to go if they have to how many frets they actually have to cover and I try to do everything on the first fret with my index everything on the second with my middle everything on the third with my ring and fourth with my pinky if I were to need that this first section here we start off with just an open C string so the first melody note is from there we place our index finger on the first fret on the e-string and we're gonna do pluck and then open E string and then again back on the first fret on the E string so the first four notes of the song are open C string first fret on the E string open E string first fret on the E string so it's from there we go down to an open a string and then we play with our ring finger here third fret on the E string second fret on the E string and then third fret on the E string so the second half of this first part is open a string third fret E string second fret E string and third fret E string so that full part here is open so I'll mention this as well if you've never read tablature before I have a video that's fully dedicated that I'll leave in the description below so you can learn a little bit more about how to read all the notation that we're using today alright moving on to section 2 let me play this for you so section 2 starts like this so how do we do that we start with an open a string so open a and then third fret on the E string and then 1st fret on the E string twice so that melody opened 3 1 on the e string and then back to an open a string and then finally here we're gonna take our ring finger start on the third fret here where you normally would play a C chord and you're gonna pluck the a string on the third fret and slide I didn't make it but slide from three to five so you make two notes with one pluck of your strumming hand here so you pluck on the third fret and you slide to the fifth if you've never done a slide before what you want to do is try to look to the place where you're going so you're gonna land on the fifth fret look at the fifth fret and try to bring your finger into your sightline this is a closed slide so you can kind of see both but you want to really practice just bringing that three two five and I'll also mention with the slide you want to keep the string compressed the entire time so if you lose pressure and try to slide you'll lose the note so really just try this slow going three five and just really listen make sure you're getting two notes in there so again this melody now let's try that together just nice and slow so we have open a string three so that is the second section let's move on to section three alright section three starts here let me just play it for you really quick so you can hear it and then we'll walk through it so it starts off with a slide [Music] so we start off here on the fifth fret somehow a cat hair has made it onto my uke cats alright so we start off here sliding from the 5th fret back to the 3rd fret with our ring finger so practice going from 3 to 5 but now you're gonna practice going back from 5 to 3 so making 2 notes with that one slide and then we have the a string twice open and then we go up to the e string and we play 1st fret 3rd fret 2nd fret and then third fret again so let's just walk through that so we have 5 slide 2 3 open a string twice 1 on the e string 3 on the E string 2 on the E string and 3 on the E string and the second half here of this third section we just start with an open a string 3rd fret on the E string first fret on the e-string so open third fret E string first fret E string and then second fret with our middle finger twice followed by an open C string and then we end it with an F chord with one strum with our thumb so an F chord is just middle finger on the second fret here on the g string index finger on the first fret on the E string and this uke does sound a little deeper because I have a low g string on here so you might notice that on this chord so your uke isn't broken it's okay so let's just play through the third section here nice and slow before we do the full play along at the end so we start here by sliding from the fifth to the third open open one three two three zero three zero one more time through the third section I'll display it and that is the third and final section so get tuned back up and let's play through the full version of the song auld lang syne so let's do a slow play along through all three sections so I'll kind of just play it here try to keep with me we're gonna go nice and slow through this one through all three sections here we go one two three four [Music] [Applause] so if you need to spend some time just going through nice and slow and methodical like that I really really really am an advocate of going through some super slow repetitions and I can tell you this because I'm learning a new instrument myself I'm trying to learn the piano and I've learned that just taking some really slow repetitions will pay off in the long run for you so just try to go through slow don't rush it and try to do it too fast really work on the technique making sure all of those notes ring out nice and clear make sure all of your slides are really ringing out you're getting those two notes out of the one pluck and I think that's really gonna help you really make this song sound beautiful so let's do a little faster version of it so again make sure you're tuned up and let's play it one more time here for the new year here we go one two three four [Music] I'll show you how to do that trick in another video well happy New Year to you I hope you guys had a lot of fun with this one and I just want to say it's been a great year with you guys I know we've done a lot of different stuff here on the channel and I really appreciate you guys sticking with me all the

yeah they do yeah it's fine yeah", "mkpXwNwxjb4": "alright I'm going to talk a little bit about the resonator and how that's made and how it works and the parts that go into it and I'm going to show you how we make one of the parts so here's a concert resonator which is about ready for finish in fact it is ready for finish and I just laid the cover plate on here so I can show you how it's going to go this cover plate is decorative and it just protects everything that's inside under that cover plate there's that there will be a wooden bridge and biscuit that the strings will go over and that's it's there and this which is really the guts of the resonator is the cone the reso phonic cone we get ours from National Instruments it's a great cone it's very lively with great volume and punch and sustain so that cone just sits inside this sound well and it floats inside inside this sound well here's one of the biscuits that will go on top of that and the front slots will get cut in that regard thank you so that comb is sitting in this wooden sound well which is turned out of cherry or maple we've tested a lot of woods and those are the best and here's what that sound well looks like after it's been turned and right before it goes into the into the body and this provides most of the bracing for the resonator top it's very solid edge secure and you can see this lip here that the cone sits on and I'm now going to show you how these are made so we start with a big piece of maple it's just a board I'm just going to show you what the board might look like 24 inches long and maybe six to eight inches high like that and we then cut an exact angle here so that when these pieces come together it's a six-sided will hexagon with some band clamps glue this which is called a stave like is used in barrels wine barrels and the like we construct this stave here's what that stave looks like after it's been mounted to the late it is mounted to this what we call waste block and in this case that stave you can still see those six pieces here and I have turned this so it's the exact diameter that I want for the outside of my sound wells and it's a nice smooth circle and then I cut the sound wells out of here like that it's like slices so let me just show you how that's done the first thing I do is get the outer diameter just where I want it so that's already been done and if you look inside here you can see that it's still rough and you can still see those stave pieces so let's just go and turn it now I've got a great surface for gluing next thing I'm going to do is check my diameter so I've got these calipers and I want to check the inner diameter here and I want it to be exactly those calipers have that diameter so it starts out that way but then it gets to fit in there well a nice taking a lot of wood out there have gotten rid of those inside that inside the stave but I can feel here that is just getting thicker and thicker spine now I'm going to take this tool and clean that inside up I stop it often and check it pretty good it's a little bit tight right in there let me just clean that up great all right now I've got to turn that little lip that the concerts in these are the calipers I use for that it's perfect I check for doubt it want to go down just about one sixteenth of a more that's perfect I want to cut it off at seven eighths of an inch down with my parting tool for this and there it is we'll clean that up just a bit that's ready to go someone's going to get a nice new resonator", "iofvfh7YH-U": "rusev at the only thing you shortly which meaningless a young decide hi guys welcome to you to guide in this lesson I'll be teaching you one of the most sensational heads from particular Cobra hum car from the movie Bava Draco it's one of the most requested song singing and today I'm very delighted to bring a detailed lesson for your own so it gets you excited take a look now jr. you can soprano tuning and let's start with the lesson so as to play this song we need five cards and these cards are called C called a minor called F kanji and called F minor now if you already know these chords then you can skip to the next part of this lesson else let's learn how to play these chords so to play chord C you need to place your ring finger on 3rd fret first string and Godsey will sound like this to play got a minor you need to place your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and got a minor will sound like this to play chord F you need to place your index finger on the 1st fret 2nd string and your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F this sound like this play chord G you need to face your index finger on 2nd fret 3rd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and chord G will sound like this to play God F minor you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 4th string your middle finger on 1st fret 2nd string and your little finger on 3rd fret first string and got F minor will sound like this so guys to play this song I will be mostly using finger picking but in case you're not comfortable with it yet then you can either strum the strings or you can simply down strum the chords so in case you want to strum the strings so there is a very easy and popular swing pattern that is down down up down up down down up down up now in case your finger picking the strings so what you have to do you have to focus on 3 strings string 1 2 & 3 so you have to use your thumb your index finger and your middle finger okay so just place your thumb over string three your index finger over string two and your middle finger over string one just like that in this position you should not touch the strings but just place it over the strings so that you would not find any difficulty while picking the strings during the song all right so the pattern would be three two three one okay you will keep on repeating it during the entire song so just just start practicing like this you need to use your left hand for now just forget about it you just use your right hand and start practicing the finger picking [Music] you can adjust the tempo ask for your requirement keep on practicing until you find it comfortable for yourself okay now once you are done with that then you can apply the same concept in various sections of the song so what you have to do you basically hold a particular chord and start finger picking the basic part in what we practice [Music] okay so from your right-hand side nothing will be changed you will be keep on repeating the same pattern but from your left hand you will be changing the chords okay so you're just changing the chords and accordingly you are finger picking the strings rusev at the only Tangier Chardonnay which maintain a steady resolve on us a cold game younger side go gay and the side a job fair everyone give revelatory a y'all go iike waste article been decided yeah okay and go saya [Music] so they

interesting question I'll start with the fact that the you know we were just passionate about what we do and for Shara and I we never get away from it and we don't want it we may not be in the shop but we're on email or on the website or on the database and you know we just love that and I hope that we always will we early on we worked in the shop you know three four five days a week and then when we started kind of the uke tracker thing and in scheduling ourselves in a more well scheduling ourselves out into the future and be very being very specific about what days we were going to work we worked in the shop four days a week and then we ramped up to five days a week and the problem with that was that we ended up being in the shop seven days a week and so let's see if we built our first ukulele in the summer spring summer of 08 then we had ramped up to five days a week very consistently toward the about a year later and toward the end of 09 and in the middle of 2010 beginning let's say of 2010 we were at a solid five days a week but as I said that we were booked five days a week were in the shop seven and then we took a month off we went to South America we went to the Galapagos Island islands and Machu Picchu and that was a great experience for us because we totally got away from the business and at that point we said you know we are on path to burn out and we don't want to burn out and we use this expression often we're running a marathon and in a marathon you don't sprint maybe at the very end but you don't want to burn and so we backed off to four days a week and then we backed off to a mix and I'm talk about shop days now a mix of three or four and now we're solidly at three and that is a pace that we think we can maintain for a long long time the the rhythm in the shop is very different from when we're out of the shop you know I'm out of the shop right now in fact i'm on vacation and I'm doing my ammo work but I don't have to I I don't have to do this today the shop when we're scheduled like we're scheduled for this sunday and when when I go out when we go out I mean we have to go out otherwise you tracker is off and people go away I think they would what's going on with my instrument and so I think that requirement weighs heavy on our mind and that's the requirement with that we wanted to keep to a reasonable minimum at three days a week with erin i think what he would say is that whereas sharra and I want to be in touch seven days a week 24 hours a day basically Erin would say I need to get away from it so we booked him in the shop for four days a week and he is not responsible for any owner interaction at all so he avoids burn out by getting away for three days a week and just putting it out of his mind and not having to you know that's how he recharges his batteries and doing some other things and so anyway that's the answer to how we avoid burnout first of all mentally we look at this as a marathon not as a sprint and we schedule ourselves accordingly and if we see any elements my experience in business is that if you burned out it's too late it is unrecoverable so I want to see that way off in the distance so that I can make some adjustments to it with char and I or erin and adjusting accordingly and we try to measure that pretty carefully so it's a very cool question that you ask and that's the answer see you next week bye bye", "CRXy_TxhLqs": "[Music] Levi oh damn Oh my math monitor [Music] [Applause] now that I can see look you simple blue spirit be free taxi Green [Music] [Music] you're a bird and a machine she died oh dear see right [Music]", "34mi-0jCCe0": "hey guys it's your lavish lana back with another video this week as always it is a very special video okay because we are trying as you saw i'm sure in the title and the thumbnail you should have saw that to make sure that you know what you clicked on but yeah anyways so this week we are going to be trying an at-home waxing kit that i got from amazon so i am very excited because i am somebody who does go and get wax regularly so if i can save money and you know try this solution at home why not so once i saw this on amazon i was like let's give this a shot so this is you guys trying it with me just as i'm trying it with you guys for the first time so without further ado let's get right into the video [Music] okay guys so let me actually show you what came in the waxing kit that i ordered so this is the lamp i opened it already i opened it already so that's why the box looks a little like jacked up but i haven't used it yet i haven't taken anything out so the the brand is called lansley you can see it better here lansley and this is their professional wax hair removal kit so it said it for all over it's their wax warming kit so a few things a few different things came in the box the main thing is this um the wax warmer let me take it out of this plastic it's like so much plastic and take it out of this plastic so this is the top that comes with it um it has like this separate bowl for the wax and this is like the warmer itself it's not too high tech it just has like i guess you could see if it's on or off and then it has the temperatures and all the temperatures are in fahrenheit so that's a little bit easier for americans i know sometimes stuff comes in celsius and i don't really know celsius i mean i know the conversion but i don't really do it so so yeah it comes with the wax warmer it also comes with this these sprays so there is the clean pre-waxing spray that i guess you're supposed to use on your skin before you start actually waxing a specific area and then there is the calm after wax oil so the clean and the calm okay to clean your skin and then to comment so yeah and then it comes with two bags of the hard wax beads and then it comes with like these big brick looking things it said on amazon that this was like the two pound package so i guess this equals two pounds which is why i got it so there's that comes with two sets of gloves okay okay we like the gloves and then the sticks to apply the wax these protective collars for the wax warmer i guess they're supposed to like pop this over the wax warmer lid when it's in there to protect yourself and these smaller wax applicators for i guess like the facial area like eyebrows or upper lip or whatever you're waxing so i got this set because everything came in one like i didn't want to have to buy too much stuff separately so that's why i chose this one because i felt like it was like the most bang for my buck like i think it was only the full set was only 35 or 40ish dollars i'll have it somewhere on the screen to show you guys probably right here somewhere on the screen to show you guys where exactly i got it from on amazon what it's called and how much it is so let's get in to the actual waxing part this is the first time that i'm attempting this so you guys are seeing me possibly mess up possibly do good i don't know we'll see wait so it should come with instructions it doesn't really come with instructions so it just says that it's easy to use and it has like these pictures on it um so it's not on the box [Music] oh there's instructions guys i missed that wax warmer kit so let's let's read the instructions these instructions don't really say anything i mean i already looked up how to do it online the process so really we're just gonna wing it guys i don't even know why i waste my time trying to read the instructions because we're gonna get it we're gonna get it done right okay so first things first you guys of course is we need to get this bad boy plugged in and ready to go i'm gonna go ahead and pluck this in right here on my vanity it's on so we need to turn it like i'm going to turn it off it came on so i have like the bucket it has like this thing in it so i'm just going to it says melt the wax in a wax warmer until it is a fluid gel texture okay so [Applause] i'm gonna put this back in this little bucket back in there i'm gonna add the this you guys can't really see it but i'm going to add this like little protective shirt now where is anyways i'm going to assume that that is where the protective strip goes i'm going to pour some of this glass in there [Applause] it's probably like i poured like half half of the bucket this is like the beads in there and i'm gonna put it on let's put it on halfway so 210 just to be safe put the lid back on and just give it some time to melt i guess i'm just gonna want these little stirring rods too just in case my little mixture needs to be stirred so let's give it some time and we'll come back when it's nice and uh melted okay guys so i left the wax to do its thing and get to it like a molasses like honey type of consistency so i'm going to test it out on my arm the first thing i'm going to do is the pre-wax cleaning oil that i opened i'm just going to spray that mashy but that's because you're not supposed to put any lotion before you wax okay don't judge me so i'm just gonna spray this pre-wax stuff on my arm pat it in with a paper towel and i'm going to get so i was using so i was using the smaller spoon to stir it but i want to use one of the bigger wooden sticks to put on my arms how do you get bigger surface areas you guys is the consistency that i have it on like they said it's supposed to drip like not too much but like honey so or like molasses or whatever i don't really like honey so i'm just gonna and they said you're supposed to do it against your hair growth so i am going to go up because my hair grows down [Music] i feel like i'm not doing this right so i got that small area for now i'm just gonna leave that there for a few seconds it's already starting to harden and since i apply it up i'm gonna rip it down okay let us i'm just gonna let it sit there for a few seconds i feel like it's gonna hurt i'm okay ready to be ripped okay i'm back i'm back it's like already attached to the hairs okay i'm just gonna i'm just gonna go for it that wasn't terrible that wasn't terrible at all and like my arms are not like super hairy to begin with but it got all the hair in that area so it does a pretty pretty decent job maybe i should like i'm gonna try it again on this arm maybe i just because i want to get it like right because i don't feel like i have it right yet so let's do it like right here okay i'm just gonna let that sit for a couple seconds i keep touching it i don't know if i'm supposed to keep touching it okay i'll let it sit and then it's because as soon as i grab it it starts pulling on like the smaller the smaller hairs okay i don't know i'm going to that wasn't bad that wasn't bad at all literally you can see all the teeny tiny hairs you guys can't see but there's like teeny tiny hairs on there that i got and it left literally left no hairs on my on this part of my arm so it definitely works like let me try the after waxing oil on oh it's like oil i'm gonna rub that in like that put it on right here and it feels really good like i don't know i probably won't do my whole arm just like my forearms like i did but yeah that is my experience waxing you guys um i definitely recommend it like i like it i want to like wax my whole leg and see how that goes i want to show you guys that though but yeah i'm going to wax my whole leg and see how that goes we tried with my arm um i would say all together i would give it a 8 out of 10 because i feel like the wax could have like melted a little bit better but like it didn't so i don't know guys but that is the end of this video let me know what you guys think in the comment section below let me know if you guys want to see me wax my whole leg i don't know why you guys would want to but if you do i will and i will catch you guys on the next video thanks for watching [Music] you", "4-RH4BgduxA": "it's really a hair with Solana today we're going to be adding the ruffle to the everyday wrap which is the middle long we've been running you can see my little seam is a little inconsistent but the ruffle we're adding is going to hide that beautifully so I'm not going to worry about it for now when you pick up stitches you can pick up both legs of the V stitch as the stockinette stitch there or knit stitch you can pick up gold or you can pick up just one side the one that's farthest away from us that's what we're gonna pick up here the reason I'm doing that is it'll create livable and it's a little easier to get your needle into just one side of the stitch than it is to get support yarn just picked those stitches up addy then I'm going to be increasing on the first row so I'm going to knit one in the front loop and knit in the back loop and that is exactly what it sounds like you're just knitting into the front of the stitch as normal and then turning the work so that you can see into the back and knitting into the back loop of that same exact stitch that increases by one so just repeat that all the way across until you've increased and doubled your stitches after you've done this you're going to purl one row but don't demonstrate that here so don't forget to do it I've done that all you can see the stitches and the nest is nicely then I'm going to do it again so I'm going to increases again after I've worked my parole row I'm going to knit in the front and the back loop of every single stitch this is gonna take a while you're dumped you've already doubled your stitches water now you're doubling it again but the good news is after this row you're pretty much done with to the back needle into the back losin it of course the baby Bob so didn't front and back I've got so many stitches crammed on the menu but that's gonna make for a really cute Russell so ready to find off all these stitches knit sides and you do that by knitting one stitch as a normal living the next one and then you leapfrog one stitch over the other so the one that's farthest away from the needle tip you just take that lift it and pull it over the one that's closest and repeats working neatly but not super tight you don't want to buckle not super loose either you don't want it to have big unsightly loops just complete that until you're done and then you'll have this beautiful little ruffle I hope you've enjoyed the middle long and join us and sharing your projects on facebook visit our website salon.com for more info on yarn and everything else", "YOXRoIv9_3k": "is me jim the pony that's prettiest on any day and i am here to tell you the things that you need to know so basically today we're going to talk about actually how to make a brazilian or bikini wax more tolerable how to make it not hurt you know what the answer is nothing it's gonna hurt regardless especially if it's your first wax it's definitely gonna hurt regardless um just like we're yanking hairs out of your skin i don't know how to make that sound more pleasing um i could say i've gotten really faster over the weeks and months definitely got faster um bracing you know things like that can definitely help while we're doing the wax as estheticians before you at home before you even get in the spa i got a couple things just a couple tips and tricks that's it so boom this little guy right here silicone scrubber is a little hair in there oh well there's some hairs in there you know whatever like fully under my arms as well sometimes i'll bully it right after i get home don't judge me um don't touch me uh basically just because sometimes it's not like the deodorant gets kind of kicked up under there so i'm gonna go ahead and get her you know nevertheless um yeah i like to use silicone scrubber just because you know it's easier to clean i really don't have time to wash my clothes that often i get to wash my clothes once a week and it's three big loads i don't have time to wash these gloves but i do have them i haven't used them in a while stick out the scrubber but totally getting gloves just well you know slap her on you know if you have nails bless you you're gonna put holes in it she fits you know no circles but a product that i have to use with either the glove or the scrubber is li honeypot get a look at her give her a shine see your angles you know it's just still something she's a little full for me i just bought this one i like to use sensitive just because you know fragrance and stuff down there just isn't anybody's friend don't let anyone tell you otherwise it's not your friend um and otherwise the honey parts are actually a really good product um i also use the spray as well let me grab her i don't have all my props together can we grab grabber the spray the calming spray which is really good as well you can spray it and like your panty line keeps you nice and you know just all the days um i really like both of these products just because they do really well in keeping um the ph uh odor together uh-huh only none of that because you know what what does this have i think it has a little bit of the what smells what's in this one uh-huh aloe vera mineral salts and lavender now that's nice that's real nice this one doesn't have any scents at all i don't know i lied lavender apple vinegar and whatever that other word is it's flower this this right here i'm not gonna lie to you okay because i'm not at to spy even though you're gonna see me at the spot i'm not at the spa right now okay if you are not if you are not exfoliating before your appointment i'm about to start keeping wipes in the spa room before we even get waxed because through the mask through the mask if i can smell you sweetheart that's not cute that's all i got to say do not do not try and come get waxed after you come from the gym after you know you've had a very long work day you know you probably sweat um or if you were on your period and you didn't wash before you came like you went through your whole day on your period and you have a full temp and you just no no no no it's not okay is that okay you come and get wax on your period that's completely up to you but here's the gotcha right you're gonna change the tampon because i'm not gonna see any blood leaking out of you no you're gonna change that tampon okay for two you should have washed or brought a whip a lap with you to wipe you up so you can go ahead and just be fresh for me and y'all know i pay attention to details i try to get up in there to get all the hairs so i'ma get close so why would you want me to be close in your regime and use not smelling together smell together smell together be clean that'll help now i'm sorry didn't even have to get violent there but you know i love target you know i love target um you know you can take any ibuprofen you know a little cramp reliever that you may like um i find it oh there's gang signs there okay i found to do no good for me um take a legacy quite literally um i know some people really do have a low pain tolerance so i understand but you know especially if you exfoliate you take maybe two i think the recommended is two uh-huh two two before your appointment um not 30 minutes though 30 minutes your food really digest in 30 minutes so about like an hour before your appointment definitely take the pills um definitely should help ibuprofen advil whichever one you know floats your paper floats your boat um hydrate definitely hydrate um waxing on dry dehydrated skin i think also plays the part because i've seen where literally after i pull a strip like i exfoliated y'all and todd just even said how she exfoliated me and i'm a dry girl dry i am very dry so i don't know it could be a lot of things i definitely do want to say to you guys though that when you guys are when you guys are getting waxed on your period the skin there is already going to be sensitive because we have a whole hormonal thing happening right now um even when you guys are pregnant and you're coming to get waxed it's not that you can't get wax when you're pregnant or on your period you're just gonna be way more sensitive and it's never gonna be fun i definitely can say that um but that being said those are your things that you should be doing before you come get waxed this is brazilian wax or a bikini line wax um another tidbit since we're here we're not at the spa um so i know and i understand that we are all humans and we use the restroom absolutely a thousand percent um but if you guys could kind of do an inspection of yourselves before i get between your legs it would be really really really really really great i really don't want to see any tissue remnants i don't want to see any remainder of poop that you didn't get i don't want to see any type of discharge um that may be occurring um again like i said we're all women but we all know how to shop and get wipes and just wipe her up real quick make sure she's okay um that's really all i have to say now this doesn't happen as often that's why you know it's not really a pressing matter but it does happen it does happen uh a little more often than we'd like so yeah just just keep that in mind it's fine you know like i said we're all human things happen that's why we're having this dialogue you see you see that's why we're doing it um yeah wait other than that you know as long as you exfoliate um drink your waters indefinitely oh an appointment just came through hello oh come on time for your appointments so when you are due for a month and we tell you four weeks don't really push for that fifth week we'd i'd rather you come in either a couple days early but those couple days late will make a difference because the hair is going to begin to root after that fourth week so then it's going to seem like your very first brazilian or bikini wax all over again and that's what you don't want at all zero you don't want any of that so definitely i would definitely say just try and keep on track trying to make sure that you are staying on top of when you need to come get waxed because if we said full three weeks we should be seeing you like if it was the 12th means the next 12. it was 13. you see the next 13. well let me see on the 15th oh this one again or 23rd cause that's not a month that's a new wax a whole brand new brazilian wax like you've never had one before so all that squirming and screaming whoo all that you caused that on you it wasn't us accountability you mm-hmm but you can't say i didn't say the things because i told you and we just did it what who said it it was jam jam the what say i'm the party prettiest on any day told you what it was and that's what it is", "fqljhiH2a2A": "[Music] hey everyone i'm going to do a video on how to wax so yeah [Music] so first what you're going to do is choose any waxing beads you want so i'm gonna be using this one a regular basic wax any kind you want it's fine um next turn on your wax machine after you turn it on cover it up so it can melt then check on the wax once it's melted start waxing but before you wax beyond this spray on your body so it can wax really nicely and it won't hurt at all next apply the wax wherever you on your body [Music] and next after you wax make sure to put this oil on your skin so it can be smooth before i go i want to give those people who want to wax a warning when using this wax it can really irritate your skin and damage your skin really bad so i would be careful when using this please use the right materials when relaxing [Music] thank you for watching", "tbDJ07ueLUc": "so today let's go ahead come a little bit closer let's take a look at this paint as you can see there's tons of scratches um even just the small ones when the sun hits it just right so what we want to do is actually we're using a cleaner wax what this does is it'll break down it's almost acts as like a compound so it'll break through a lot of those minor scratches and defects and then as we buff it in and wipe it off with one of these soft microfiber towels it'll leave it with a mirror finish and put a protectant over it so we're just going to do this section just so we can show you guys what it looks like the only thing you have to watch out for if you don't want to get it on plastic so then it'll stain it white and it does not come off so we're just going to let that dry for a second um and then we'll go ahead and use one of these rags and wipe it off final step for waxing is just taking it off you don't need to apply a lot of pressure just make sure your towel is soft and clean and then you'll see as i i'm taking the wax off that i rotate my towel so that i'm not just spreading it let's go ahead and do it you cool it's not perfect but that's just if you do that periodically you will put a protectant over your paint that way if you live in a snowy place and they put salt on the roads you can protect the paint so it doesn't get corroded and rusty but even if you look here like if you feel it this will be nice and smooth this is super rough like it's 19 day difference so that's how you wax pretty simple", "W4138hiKhPE": "[Laughter] all right um what's up guys welcome back to my channel um as you can see with the title of this video um that's what's happening today so uh i'm a little nervous and one thing about me is that when i get nervous i feel like i have to go poo no but seriously so i'm trying to get this [ __ ] over with um this is my first time by the way so yeah we'll see how that goes wish me luck oh my god you're already starting oh yeah we started oh my god i'm just not going back now oh my god oh oh i'm not exaggerating like seriously i'm scared it's perfect ah it already hurts oh my god what the hell it already hurt okay let's make this quick you ready no all right we're gonna do this one on the side first we'll do the top and then we'll do this one right here right here this one shouldn't be too bad because you don't have a lot of hair right here come on breathe in that's not too bad huh oh that one's gonna hurt oh no i think my cousin said like right here the top center yeah okay just leave it there it's gonna make your legs with a little bit over here oh my god is that the one that hurts yeah oh sweating this is a workout yeah cause you don't have a lot of hair i'll be like the one that i just did right now on the other side it hurts sadly they're all hurt but i want her that's bad oh my god like that i thought oh my god i can't do this it's easier this way oh my god talk about something that's like nothing related yeah so like think about this you want huh", "qKMhXsOnb9U": "i'm cheating and using the mirror right next to me because it's really hard to do just while you looking at your phone okay all right and like i said i can pull it now but i'm going to wait just a little bit longer just to be safe the one thing i do like about underarm waxing that i know i will be happy now that i've started again is you don't see those little dots um right after you shape you know you shave and okay yeah the hair's gone but you see that little that little black or brown dot underneath the skin i don't like how that looks so um it is a big motivation for me to start doing it again and then again being a wax room and come on might as well okay again normally you want to hold the skin but since i'm doing it myself i really can't do that so we're just gonna let it go that one wasn't nearly as bad as the first one so much better okay oh my gosh again you can see all of those oh my goodness okay uh dude so much better i'm gonna do one more little one gosh i can't even see anything okay i'm gonna do one more little one i'm gonna do a little more powder because i'm sweating because i'm nervous that was not enough powder i was like nothing oh my gosh look at my shirt that's that's why you don't wear a black shirt to wax yourself here i am trying to at least look similar", "rMLc-Vq9kAU": "little dick [ __ ] yeah yeah uh-huh yes yeah i am serious i'm [ __ ] camping
