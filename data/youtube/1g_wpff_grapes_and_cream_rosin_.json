{"ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch

grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time

at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it she'd be

[ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what

of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running

going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "pcgb1YtOGd0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you can run no she is

gram of rosin by callia [Music] i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys this is a live rosin here so i've kept this in the freezer at home i have it on an ice pack here because i'm visiting lizzy and jesse today i kept it in a little ice pack bag today so that way i could come down here and now i've had it out for a few minutes i'll open up the gram here we're gonna go ahead and use the popco this isn't the pro this is the original um puffco but the tropical rainbow colored one and we're gonna go ahead and use this one just because i didn't have the other one with me this one we're gonna go ahead open brand new now if you look this is ice cream cake this is beautiful i personally love the strain ice cream cake in flower and almost in basically almost any form of cannabis that has been coming and i love the live rosin smell because it's going to come off super sweet inside the dab here i'll give you guys a little info as well on the ice cream cake as i usually do in my videos now for thc it comes in at 69.5 activated chc it comes in really high at 78.84 it has 0.25 cbd and 84.18 cvs let's go ahead and open this up for the first time on camera here and try this out all right it's super pretty super beautiful [Music] oh this is gonna be good let's smell it when you smell it it has a really strong strong cake smell to it just really strong there oh super sweet are you guys our other friends are coming over so i'm trying to film this little video real quick i'm gonna go ahead and get into this who's making some sound we have some puppies in the background now i got this new dab tool i ordered it from gypsy stixx online on instagram it's super cute i did a little post on instagram of it if you want to see it a little more up close there's some rhinestones up here um there's a pointy side and then a little flatter side i personally for rosin do like the flat flat edge side which i'll show you guys on another dab tool i have here oh this one's going to be a little dirty but um this dab tool is a little flatter on the bottom i'm kind of like how a flathead screwdriver would be but a little thinner than that that's really usually nice for rosin and we really hate to break this up but we're going to go ahead and try it so that way we can take a dab of it in the puffco okay i was worried if it would come out too much like a shatter and just break but it doesn't it came out really smooth we're going to get a little bit bigger of a dab here and we're going to go ahead and see i can just get this straight onto the puffco right here perfect now the puffco hasn't been warmed up i haven't taken any dabs just so that i could do this dab and not worry about it melting on me as i put in the puffco and let's go ahead and set the puffco up here we're on white i'm gonna double click it so it heats up and it vibrates we're gonna let it vibrate again because this one is pink at the bottom and i have like pink accents on it it does make it kind of look pink when it lights up but it's not like the puffco pro that lizzie's here watching me film it's not like the puff gopro where i have it set up where it actually lights up pink which i think is my favorite thing but i do have it all set up here it's cute it's little we have the pink accents what more could you ask for let's go ahead and try out this ice cream cake it vibrated it's ready to go what that's really good okay at first i didn't know if i would cop or not i think man third try i'm gonna cough it's gonna make me cough um i really like this this ice cream cake is strong the aftertaste of it is really super strong you really taste the ice cream cake there it's a really strong sweet cakey flavor tastes a little cloudy and i really like that kind of just tastes like i said i like ice cream cake i like gelatos um i like wedding cakes and all that that's something that i personally prefer so i really do like the flavor of this i think that ice cream cake is really nice as well um and yeah so thank you guys so much for watching this is just a quick little video i wanted to do a review as far as the high i get from it you do instantly kind of feel like a nice little head height especially when you use it on a piece if you have it um set to go a little hotter or if you use it through a piece of glass you're going to feel like an instant kind of little headbrush from it but it's nice because it does mellow out it does smooth out it is something that um you will make you feel high for me personally when i take a dab for the next hour or two i'll feel like the main major high of it and then it'll die down um not like a blunt where it can be super instant and then it goes away or an edible where it hits you like an hour later and just stays there i thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any questions i'll link my social media down below and thank you guys for watching this video alyssa is out bye guys", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process

rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "zv324iwzTso": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]", "k7Zryii5NIE": "this is a follow-up video on the live run so before I get started I went ahead and made some changes to this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and you any questions or comments comment down below", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot

here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick

away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "1nDQEqUiV_o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like

rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna get back some amazing rosin if you want high-quality results you need high quality

since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man

to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the

payne here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick west coast video tour review featuring special guests justin cures what's good what's good what's good uh he's you know justin's a dabber so we're going to do a quick uh dabbing review we've got calgary extracts we've got sun cake and a sweet and sour today's review is going to be the sweet and sour so first episode out of two we're going to dive in i know nothing about this extract other than what's on the packaging so it's an ice water extract we're working with rosin here then some fire rosin really tasty very you know talked about all over california from oakland um from the bay area so please recycle i like that enjoy using your favorite cannabis extract paper device keep cool to preserve flavors ingredients fresh frozen cannabis um oh this is the sun cake oh it's backwards uh sweet and sour rosin manufactured by zinganic incorporated uh what are we looking at here seventy two point six two percent on the thc eighty one point five one on the tfca point one nine percent on the cbd cbs 88.5 one percent that must just be total cannabinoids yeah the total cannabinoids equals cbs no not the show i was thinking oh my gosh [Music] i know right new new oh 70 u to 120 u bro oh wow sweet and sour smells like stanky stanky sprite stinky funk stanky funky sprite i kinda like it i'm excited to check the way we do the the west coast we tour review y'all we're gonna take one dab each and then we'll talk about it we're gonna take a second dab and then we will give you a final score out of ten um from there the score will be translated over to a hundred point review on our website respect my region.com so make sure you guys go check out the site we post reviews and music and [ __ ] every day so that's justin's dab i will not be dabbing something that large and just to give a little context there you go bro dip into the pie uh just to give a little context i love calia in terms of like how this [ __ ] always looks the same whenever you get it it's always the set how it says 70 u um to 120 and if you put it up to the sun it's that nice color nice bubbles going through it and then you wait a couple days and you get this really nice um what i call like that butter up right and then it's nice and cakey as they say and it's just a little bit easier to work with to get the dab on the tool and i feel you get a much nicer much nicer dad like a more flavorful batch so my my thing is is i like the quality of it smells really good i'm sitting here thinking to myself what else do i want to know right now and sweet and sour obviously isn't the genetic unless they're naming that and still so i want to know what kind of high i'm about to do i want to know i want some of that excitement to hit me and so sun cake i'm sure is like some kind of wedding cake across let's what does what is sweet and sour over here sweet and sour i want to say it has some cake in there as well like the sun cake um where are you at 900 nice but sweet and sour um i believe it's i want to say cake gelato one of those in there but you know we'll really be able to tell tell really what it is after the taste test all right you guys it's coming in we're using a terp timer to make sure we don't scorch the dabs super important to make sure you guys are taking low temp properly tent properly timed out dabs we don't want you guys getting burning yourselves yeah is this actually shout out to octave that is accurate my brother go ahead you're bringing me to it so you don't let me know how it is i'm still around like 900 degrees felt like it wasn't that good let's see was it hot did it feel like it was a hot dog it's crazy because it definitely it definitely said you saw it but did you you gotta leave it like this let it sit right there and let it be underneath the laser see there was hot dab on camera i don't know because now now it's saying 500. it's all good you used to have the laser all the way on it go ahead now go ahead now you try it yeah dip again bro you're still looking you're still beating me because i'm still it is at four seven it's not six hundred all right well first job roasted everything's gone go that's at four 470 470 degrees that should be a nice much better melt and i'm there oh i'm still got 100 degrees away properly attempt properly properly temp the second time yeah because when you have it you know properly aligned oh yeah not moving the trip timer is incredibly accurate incredibly accurate mine just hit by a hundred i let it go down to 480. cheers y'all i like it down a little bit lower at the 440 460. oh yeah tastes like a little [ __ ] a sundae from mcdonald's mcflurry i'll give it to him first down hot dab total technological difficulties between your torch and my goddamn turn timer over here but we're an embarrassment argument now when it comes to the second dab low temp perfectly timed mine was perfectly time i'm coming in i'm coming into the next 27.5 bro three point seven i'm coming in at 8.75 we're going to have no technical difficulties in the sun cake but for the flavor the strain how i feel right now i've i really enjoyed the taste of that but we don't know what strain that is you don't know what kind of high we're even supposed to feel i mean i really like if you look at the nail i mean the color is the color is really nice on the melt the flavors there um i i have to agree with you it's definitely up there you know above 8.5 for me definitely hitting a nine hitting the nine club you think it's a nine i think it's a solid nine cause cause i only give hash like a 9.5 and up if i am a smack and i'm not smack down the string i'm not very smack it's more of a flavorful it's very calm this is that this is that rosin dab that you take it wasn't a tsunami wave it was just a nice little it's that roswell taking the morning before you go to work it's that dab you take to improve your day whether it's 15 minutes before work or in the middle of the day the quick break or yeah you know for sure evening you improve your mood get you an extra hour of energy et cetera um nice hybrid right yeah i'm coming in final score for me is going to be that 8.75 i'd like to see the genetics and the terpene information i think that stuff is super important i agree um give us to me the packaging is also a little bland the white and black it doesn't necessarily pop from me but i do feel there are some super positives in terms of the quality of the flower the quality of the oil the quality of like the smell the nose right um i i would assume what's the price point on this roughly this is um out the door eighty dollars a gram so and that's giving you the average on like is it the most cost uh cost conscious product out there no it is definitely up there in terms of it needs to perform at the best the best in terms of quality so great work to tell you let me know what you guys think below please utilize the comments like follow

love you guys peace", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just

episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode we'll see you guys in the next west coast video review respect my region justin curious love y'all peace", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh yeah that works in this

yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the

"N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]",

a second run a bubble how should I made it was a little darker so it came out a little bit darker it smells [ __ ] fire though I'm using the Dooley Tech [ __ ] bags I just left over from when I purchased them to be honest Dooley Tech [ __ ] sucks they're at least their bags do I don't know how the rest of the products do but they're [ __ ] bags they suck [ __ ] ass I had a blowout on that one there and I was the 3 grams or 2 grams two and a half grams of bubble hash I was running at a high temp so I dropped the temperature down this is what I'm gonna run at seven grams of some full melt bubble hash this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire guys it's sticky sticky one it's really really really sticky really fire you could just see how sticky that [ __ ] is it smells [ __ ] amazing this is all of my strings together so it's pretty much a hybrids indica it's actually Kryptonite gelato and gorilla glue you can just look at the quality of this [ __ ] hash it's [ __ ] fire but yeah we're gonna go ahead and pack this up in the bad guys and give me one second so I can get this set up so you guys can get a little bit of a better look get some parchment paper cut out [Music] so what are you guys up to today you guys having any time for Tuesday I don't go into work until tonight so I'm pretty much free all day long until the evening falling so by MIDI mid mid day and then I go to work but until then I meet this hash yesterday oh it came out pretty good I ended up getting about oh I want to say I want to say I got about 10 grams I guess of bubble hash and that was - how many how many ran it watched it twice I didn't do it any more than that the second wash I did I was doing a little bit aggressive and came out a little darker it was an amber like this first one here it was still sticky it just came out a little bit darker actually came out a lot doctor that's the bow hash like that's the rosin I just showed you guys in the and the other one I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out there's and that's the actual hash but yeah I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out and I'm gonna go ahead and load it up in the bag now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna slide it in there as best as I can without hopefully it doesn't stick too much to the bag all right it went right in so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fold it over on itself guys got a nice little puck in there I'm not gonna cut this bag I cut the last one little Desai's just uh hope you nothing bad would happen but I don't know I might even double bag this guy's cuz I had a blowout on the last one I don't want to have a blowout on this one but maybe I just want press as hard maybe I'll just go a little softer you know I think that's probably what he's gonna do so let's go ahead and head over to the press guys this is my press face it's a 12-ton press and I'm running got pressed as far as the heat plates I did drop the temp a little bit but I think I'm gonna drop that even more guys and I'm gonna do a real real slow press on this so I'm gonna go ahead and set these temps a little lower I'll go to 175 I was running at 200 earlier and I dropped it down to 180 but it wasn't all the way down to 180 when I pressed it was like at 190 I want to say so I'm gonna run that in a lower temp 175 I'm gonna bet that go ahead and drop for a minute until then I'm just gonna go ahead and get set up here I'm running 3x3 dad pressed plates these [ __ ] plates are [ __ ] pretty good guys I haven't had any issues with this press or this plate these plates for since I bought it actually is still pretty new I've only used though I've used the hell out of it I've pressed a lot of [ __ ] flowers as you can see I pressed there's some rosin chips right here this when people refer to rosin chips this is what they're talking about guys this is the leftovers of your actual presses and they're still resin in those guys you can save those and you can use them for butter I'll go ahead and show you exactly what I'm talking about guys let's up here see that stuff right there that's coconut oil it's a little mouthy because I have it on the top cabinet and I have the heat on now but usually it's pretty solid it's just like a butter it's coconut oil pretty much you just boil it in coconut oil and sift it all out and there's your edibles and you can make whatever you want I actually made some cookies the other day and some brownies and they came out [ __ ] amazing guys matter of fact I still got some right here I used about half - half ratio we took my cookie between the butter and the coconut oil but I like my [ __ ] strong guys and I put actually about a half a pound over those rods and chips I want to say not a half pound maybe about 7 ounces 6 ounces of these rosin chips into about 3 cups of that coconut oil and that [ __ ] came hush 204 guys literally came out strong with some good [ __ ] but yeah the temps are starting to drop two hours you could see the right side drop in faster than the left side is that's just the top and bottom plates but it'll match up real soon here guys but yeah at least this [ __ ] rosin press is [ __ ] kicking ass guys I really like pressing but I used to do a lot of BA chose but be honest that's just it costed me a lot of money than butane and my time and it was dangerous [ __ ] this is way more easier it's safer and not to mention your terpenes man this [ __ ] [ __ ] you preserve all your terpenes on all your flavor of all you of all your Rosen's you put your Preston guys she just comes out [ __ ] fire but yeah man I ever since I've gotten my press and and started running it I actually love it it's it doesn't get any better than this I should say because like I said it's just the terpene profile itself if you're doing a really low dab really low press as far as the heat you [ __ ] flavor profile of the buds it's [ __ ] amazing especially if they're fresh buds and there they were within three or four weeks of being picked or harvested man you're gonna have amazing amazing [ __ ] rosin I've actually had a almost clear rosin come out I bet you that's what this is gonna end up doing it's gonna come out really really amber really clear it's not gonna be dark at all especially if you're running on a low temp you're gonna get some [ __ ] amazing I used to press this windows breath and I'm not even lying dude it was stink my whole house up it's not like like fruity pebbles it was amazing I I was amazed the first time I pressed that stuff I was like [ __ ] and just the way it smelled my pressed is the way it tasted and it was amazing it was good stuff just the act rosin is the way to go especially if you're doing it yourself and you got that you can do it with your own product it's just so much fresher taste so much better you'll never want to go back to being chose again be a chose or thing of the past as far as I I think I'm gonna have a pretty good little run off with this at this amount of hash but I'm not sure we'll see it's only about it's actually not even a full quarter it's about six six point four six point five and then there's my six and a half grams but it's still a pretty good amount of rosin so I mean of hash so we're gonna go ahead and press it out and see what we get I'm not really worried about my turn I'm more worried about the bag blowing out his [ __ ] bags and I'm not easily tech bags they suck man I haven't had one good experience and and I've tried different microphones actually when I purchased these I bought them for zoo they were cheaper and I figured well [ __ ] maybe it's just uh it's I mean it's got to be the same micron regardless so I figured I don't know there's ditch quality or whatever but these bags I've had blowout so I'm pretty much every single bag that I ran even in flowers flowers a little bit easier to contain and then the oils as far as hatched when you're when you're pressing so I'm gonna take it real slow on this one I'm not gonna force it I'm just gonna let it melt its way down through the people bed I'm gonna take it slow and easy on this one I'm not gonna force it I got it right on the edge because uh it's not gonna be pushing anything out it's not gonna be expanding too much so we're just gonna go ahead and paint it down so about right there I'm not pushing it too much we're just gonna let it start melting and you can see immediately it starts it starts shooting out rosin so I'm just gonna let it go ahead and mount melt it through the bag and let it do it low and slow those times I might even drop the temp a little bit more to 165 which I think I'm gonna do right now so that way by the end of my press it should be cooler than it was when it started over water 167 that should be good yeah they do that gold and honey okay I'm just painting it down as on just taking it very easy I don't want to blow through this bag and [ __ ] this batch of hat or bras it up even if I have to press it halfway through and then take it out and redo it again I will I don't wanna blow through this bag and you can just look at that color guys and you know what I'm gonna give me one second alright guys sorry about that [ __ ] bag blew through if I have to go clean it up repack it [ __ ] put another bed over it Pam [ __ ] ass I wasn't even putting that much pressure on it these [ __ ] bags guys if you ever buying Dooley Tech to be honest they're [ __ ] shits garbage stay away from it from what I can tell they're a [ __ ] rosin presses are half decent I wouldn't say they're the best but they'll get the job done like I say get what you pay for pretty much so I'm gonna go ahead and pause this video guys I'm gonna keep a good eye on this that way I don't [ __ ] it up and I'll start the video up as soon as the rosin starts coming out alright guys we're getting some rosin off the side I'm trying not to push it too hard I don't wanna blow through the bag and [ __ ] up my [ __ ] so I'm just taking it really really slow that's why sorry I bought the video being so long guys looks like it's starting to come out on this side as well I would when it came off on the last batch I cleaned out around where blew out on this corner you could tell the change in the color looked like the raw slick the rosin like the hash I'm sorry so I went ahead and just cleaned up what was cleaning on the other I tell it from the other parchment paper in the kitchen guys but yeah I got it on a really low temp it's I 165 166 it's jumping up and down between the 67 or 66 we'll see how the the end product looks I'm just applying light pressure I don't know why these Dooley tech bags do that [ __ ] man they're [ __ ] garbage every [ __ ] one I've used even for flowers it's just garbage I guess if you're on a budget but even if you're in a budget it's not worth it because you're gonna [ __ ] get you're gonna get plant matter in your in your rosin or you're gonna get hashing your rods depending on how you're pressing just almost better just to press the but by itself and use their [ __ ] so I got my hand on the handle as I'm just pulling it down slightly as I as I see the rosin coming out and it's coming out of all sides days looking pretty good so it's Laos [ __ ] amazing just to know what I can smell it looks nice color nice and amber and I know this videos longer I started about the length of it I should have maybe I'll edit it and I really don't have a lot of pressure on it now guys I'm barely putting pressure on it I don't have a gauge on this to tell me how many tons I'm putting on it but from [ __ ] that I pressed in the past I'm not putting very much weight on it at all just with the way to my hand on here I can pull the lever down that's how much that's I mean that just goes to show you how hard I'm pushing on it I'm not really pulling on here at all wait until it all melts goes through the screen and then I'm gonna try to press out at the end maybe I'll hold off and just let it let the pressure push out what's there and then I'll clean it off and then I'll press it again afterwards but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video guys it's really heading on 20 minutes 17 minutes I don't want to make it too long he does have a good day be careful darkness", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "mLdir-jTbm4": "mm-hmm all right guys I'm letting the press preheat and preheating the wax as well the puck of rosin of um hash this is bubble hash five grams and I'm just a slight pressure on there very little whatever is leaking out now it's just just pre oil from if I press it too fast it'll blow the bag out and it'll contaminate the rest of all of the rosin with the hash so I'm trying to just squeeze it slow and low like I said the temps I have was a little bit high usually I do about 180 175 I might drop this back down to 175 just because I don't want to put too much heat to the rosin I'm not trying to decarboxylate it I'm just trying to press it out of the out of the 25 micron bag that I'm using as a filter you can see it's already starting to pour out pretty decent like I said I haven't put any pressure on this yet but as soon as I do it's all gonna come out gushing like I said low and slow that's the way to do it to get the best quality rosin and this was hashed I've actually had sitting around for about a month it's just been sitting around just I haven't really been needed to use it till now so I'm gonna make me some rosin to smoke on not that I don't have any rosin but did for something different different profile different THC content everything is different every time unless you're running the same exact strings on all times me I'm always constantly running different strains and we're hitting 170 and 175 on the top and bottom plate so I can pretty much put all the pressure I need on it now and it should all start I mean out and as you can see it's pretty decent it's a little darker because like I said I've had this hatch sitting around for quite a while I didn't put it in the fridge or anything I just let it laying around so it's completely ready to rock and roll it's a pretty good glove if you ask me and you can see it's all coming out on the sides as well this is all just for personal use total press time on this is probably maybe three minutes maybe if that and I started out the temp at like 69 70 degree temperature just whatever the plates were when I started it up and just continued to put the put the puck in there and started just light pressure like I said until I started adding pressure and it all came out it's all ready to come out now as a matter of fact I was allowed - I've put all the pressure I could on it before I either rip the paper or do something stupid so [Music] give me one second I'll show you guys what it looks like alright guys this is what it looks like after the fact I did have a little tiny blowout right there in this corner right there a little bit I must have blew out this corner right here but the rest of it is pretty clean i'll see any contaminants other than a little tiny bit right here which i'll just it doesn't matter to me i'm gonna smoke it either way but everything else looks and pletely clean smells [ __ ] amazing until you get right there get down to the piece like I said it's separate it's just like pressing a bud just couldn't clean around and get the best you can the filter bags like I said especially when you go into pressing hash it's a it's it's all concentrate and it's all oils so you're gonna get way more than you would if you were to press flour and it heats up a lot faster because it's not as much material in the way as far as plant matter it's just hash and that's it and try Coneheads and lipids and whatever else is in there but yeah that's pretty much it guys and then these hash bags you can save them and press them again or you can you can just save them and once you get a good amount of them you can make butter or or edibles out of it you just drop them in a crock pot with some butter and that the whole bag everything and then it'll dissolve in the oil and it'll separate the oil from the whatever else is left in there as far as whether you're planting pressing plant matter or hash it doesn't make a difference then you sift it out with the cheesecloth and you can use that oil for anything it's gonna be decarboxylated and ready to rock and roll you can put it in brownies you can put it in cooking you can make tinctures you can learn about tinctures but you can make pretty much anything with edible wise tinctures I'm not sure how that would work I think you got to use the actual oil without any butter in there cuz I the way I'm telling you to do is use a unsalted butter or you can use salted it doesn't matter and then you just put about a half a pound of butter with with a quarter pound of chips or rosin pucks or however you doing it the more pucks you have the stronger it's going to be alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video off it's getting a little long so have a good day be safe and I stay medicated", "t8ylJlR_mL8": "[Music] Leslie [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] Leslie [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",

hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to Like subscribe [ __ ] leave a comment thank you again for watching peace", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "YSqErHoFa1Q": "happy Sunday thought I'd share what I'm doing here today I'm making some fresh frozen bubble hash there's two containers of fresh frozen grade-a bud bunch of the tops from mostly one with some of a second blue dream this is a bubble bag dude bubble hash machine I think originally it was for clothes probably got a 15 minute timer on it very basic there's the timer for the soap is done so the material that's in there isn't a work bag with two bags of ice layered like a cake with demineralized water it just soaked for 15 minutes and now I'm gonna do my first wash first wash I'm gonna do is five minutes you don't want to do the first wash for very long because that's where your primo stuff is first and second wash mostly so I got to put my bubble bags in the bucket here so I can drain what comes out of that washing machine into or through the bubble bags so I'm gonna start this anyways and then I have to properly layer the bubble bags you want to start with the best smallest micron which in my case is 25 and put that in the bucket first then 73 then I think it's 120 or 160 and etc [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "9ZbZxhnYIjg": "this is captain dink we're in the Spanish lab again today I'm going to be showing you how to load bottle textile rosin bag extraction what we're going to use today is the nut Smasher 3 point 5 gram 160 micron bags and again we're going to be loading it bottle textile versus slat style like that and bottle textile first of all we have to invert the corners and as you can see here adjust it a little bit with your fingers but that's what you're looking at the corners are going to be overlapping to each other so as the extraction happens it's going to fold in on itself so let's load up three - grams of this beautiful fortune cookies here fresh flour and as you can see there there's 3.5 grams as beautiful once again this was donated to us by the folks up at Bullis farms in that a city California so a bottle textile again what we're gonna do start dropping our flour into our bag and what you want to do is build a foundation as you load your flour I want to fill on the air gaps as you put it into the bag smells beautiful and as you can see we've built our base here we're filling in all the air grabs with the flour so once again on the bottle Tech or Barrel textile whichever you prefer to call it this particular style that happens is again during the extraction itself the bag is going to collapse in onto itself and we're gonna have a nice little round puck left over again on barrel tick you want to leave maybe a half inch at the top of your bag everything else you cut off it doesn't suck up any of the extraction itself and then once you get it to a half inch the other part of barrel tech is you're going to fold the bag over like you what a present one side to the other and then the rear like this kind of load in to the machine this way so let's go over to the note Smasher touch here I'm going to load our bag into the machine as you can see how it folds in and it will accordion in onto itself but instead of going through the whole press process I will show you the result this is the fortune cookie three and a half gram press as you can see beautiful golden rosin and that's what you're looking for is a puck like this using the bottle textile with a nug Smasher is going to give you optimal press and optimal yield using the nug smasher bags once again this is captain dink here in the smash lab until next time", "Ami8tg7xjAQ": "[Music] [Music] i [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] you", "30ufFiDcALU": "[Music] one thing you know I talked about besides you catching up with a few other growers this morning the law were talking about winterization and fresh frozen so how much I mean you don't have to tell us exactly how many pounds you're pushing yeah but even just a percentage if that's something you're getting into and and how much of it are you allocating to essentially for lack of better term diversify your portfolio totally so I mean we have 50,000 square feet of outdoor I would say this is the kind of the first year that I'm actually allocating a good amount of a to fresh frozen just kind of seeing where the markets evolved on the scale of production where we're at limitations on where we can dry it so getting into that fresh frozen which means we just take the plant fresh bucket down clean it up a little bit and freeze it right away straight to the fre straight to the freezer and that's where the extract artists these days are that's where they get the most high-end product that's Tyson to live rosin rosin indoor live resins you have the live rosin which is the organic kind of bubble hash extraction and then pressing it and I'll get you the live rosin and then the other side of it is the live resin which guys are pushing the fresh frozen material through BHO gotcha and then and then just creates a different product yeah well together right totally different cuz I actually this year just as an experiment gave the same crop same thing you know same everything same greenhouse to a BHO live resin just manufacture and a live rosin and the product is so different if I didn't know they were grown even the same strain really it's just such a difference in the way it comes out and we might even see that amongst extractors as well because the different techniques so that's kind of fun and cool it's just to see the differences of like your raw material because when you drive the flower it's gonna be the dried flower the extract brings this whole other element to come to our party so I think a Frenchie cannoli I know he's really come up on the scene lately and there's there's individuals like him around the world but it really is an art that's one thing you know as crazy as Frenchie can be I love that he really puts that emphasis that it is in art when he's doing bubble hash yeah you know and it is a totally different experience for them and that's the only thing it takes different infrastructure so you gotta have freezer rooms ways to transport that and then what if a freezer goes down and you know 200 pounds of material in there you gotta have a backup in place like so there's a lot of things it's a lot of lot to think about a lot of moving parts I probably prefer I wish I could just dry at all traditionally and and do that but it's fun to evolve with the market and see new products come out and be a part of all that so just got to adapt and do a little bit everything so overall I'd say probably you know we focused on trying to keep the tops of the plants for a flower the best stuff of the best and then focus on the lower and it also helps with the harvest time because we can get all those tops that are more susceptible to mold or botrytis get them hanging and dry in gives us some more time to deal with like the lower but still good quality yeah you know as a grower I always smoke the smalls I don't the biggest artichokes aren't always the most flavorful it's funny how that transcends so many things or even like yeah lobsters shrimp and there are so many things it's your point quality over quantity right so it allows us to to time out she says big hands you know you're the one I'm like is that from a song yeah so it allows us to time out the harvest a little bit yeah and so I'd say we're doing about 25% fresh frozen this year pretty fair amount for a 50,000 square foot canopy yeah that's that's why I got 420 square feet of freezer space this week there are there are supposedly some companies coming up that are that are manufacturing companies that rely on that fresh frozen material I haven't personally run into a company that's sending troops up to do that work for us I am working with one of the the biggest brands and in the space right now in the industry and they're about to launch if they haven't launched it yet a live rosin brand and I can guess who that is I think they're based out of justjust not too far from here actually based in here in Humboldt yeah and so we're gonna be one of their their main three producers for their fresh frozen line nice I mean I think it's probably open now is they have an Instagram up so I think that's all good but pop in Barkley's is introducing a live one brand brand so it's gonna be Papas Papas select [Music]", "PG88Ezyr8cc": "hey guys youtube's been real awesome about the community guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the correct height for optimal dabbing just want to say if you're still watching this video to like the video because you know it's a pretty long video and if you're still watching it that means you like me [ __ ] also subscribe for better wheat this rig i think is called decline recycler i think i'm not gonna lie i'm not too sure so if you know exactly what kind of rig this is to drop it down below i have not taken a dab from this particular rig in probably a hot year hot year why do i say things so weird it's been over a year since taking a dab off this rig my go-to rigs as of recently have been um bottle rigs for some reason i just really like the way they chug and um also probably because they are the newest you know pieces to my collection so i've been you know going ham on those bottle rigs but they do chug like a [ __ ] [Music] first dab of the day okay that first dab was [ __ ] so we're gonna do another dab here um [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] that was a little hot it [ __ ] still had a lot of flavor it wasn't too too hot it's just a little hot i am [ __ ] high right now holy [ __ ] hey guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it um please don't forget to like subscribe and of course what else [Music] i'm really stoned and like i can see some dust on my lens and i'm i just i can't help but think that you can see the dust freckle you", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "OLJK1JT08BY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",

game and effective brain of a field like I going half nuts now I came up in a rough town tell me", "hMYxdRmZ5l0": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to be pressing some vanilla berry pie 20 point 18 percent THC from three boys farm which is now known as one plant but it was a three boys farm at the time on my 10 tongue that press drip tech dab press nah it's a dead press and it's called dead press so there you go all right so this vanilla berry Piatt is the first order I ever made from one plant and it was a really dry batch with not much smell to it and so I threw in some intent and type of booze pack and all these things to moisten it up it's like 60 - I think it's 52 percent humidity I'm not exactly sure here you can take a look at it inside here I'll give it a small it's got its got a berry smell to it now you're back then I really didn't have much of a smell to it and these do have a good effects these nugs but I think bringing it back to life with the integra was a necessity for sure here's a a nice shot of these nodes before I give them the press like I said they had decent effects even though the flowers themselves were unimpressive alright let's go ahead and get these buds weighed in and that way we can have an idea of what the yield is like go ahead and tear out the scale nodes these are actually pretty decent looking lugs and they they smell again now that I put the booth back in there all right looks like it's 3.5 grams on the money I don't know if you can see that alright and I use the trottle tech method I'm not sure if anybody out there is familiar with it but basically I use a 120 micron mesh bag but cut off at both ends and I'll show you how that works probably need to get something to break this stuff up on I just like to break it up a little bit so that smushes nice and tight into the filter bag if there's any big stems like this I'm just pulling out so I had pressed um some from this batch before and it didn't pretty had really really um disappointing results I don't know if it had been fully rehydrated at that point or not though so who knows alright so now we have an eight broken up right here on this piece of paper is a little bit I'm gonna take the filter bag and just start stuffing it full of weed basically there's definitely a lot more aroma now that I've broken this all up I found another stem in there I'm going to take that outside and break the bag or break through the parchment either you just gotta stuff all this stuff in there basically a couple more little stems in there if this suckers out luckily I don't think I see any seeds go grab something real quick but my help in this there's no escaping the drawer of doom alright so I just basically got a flat it's just a kitchen tool with a flat dough on the bottom handle swing smooch this down basically want to get this as compressed as possible so you can fit all of it in here and have a little puck going on inside the bag that's what I'm trying to get accomplished and so I believe the expected yield I heard something like it you know a good yield should be something like 2% under the stated THC percentage and I've gotten that that seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb I have to say but we'll see what this one does every strain is different every batch is different it depends on the growing conditions on all kinds of stuff the maturity level when they were harvested lots of variables that go into getting a good squish as they say and um so just so you know I'm not I don't want this to be all broken up like this into shake that just happened when I was breaking it up so you know ideally you just want to break it up a little bit so it fits into a puck shape inside here all right now I have my finished shuttle tech puck to be squished and turn into rosin smells pretty good good look at it yeah it's all smushed into a puck and I actually could have had a little bit less of this filter bag right here but that's okay it's not a huge deal I scrape this very last bit of crumbs on there all right but we have our eight of vanilla berry pie all puffed up in our shuttle tech bag we need to set up the damn press to get ready to be pressing some tabs how about that so I'm gonna adjust the camera and get right over there alright so first I need to turn on the heating plates there we go finally and I like to start out at 180 so I'm gonna take that down I just like to do my first passes at lower temperatures to preserve as many Terps as I can gotta have them terpene you know that's what rosin is all about is the Terps otherwise you just have other forms so we got that going at 180 the gauge on this I draw a camp up here that's what's gonna be operating you can see you once gets to 180 it'll be ready to go ready to press some dad's out press some nose alright so now that I've got the heating plates heating up from the PID with up to 180 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and get the press set up between two sheets of parchment paper for the first month all right ready to go all right I've got it all set up just like I need it these I just use cheap bulk parchment paper because I still have this thing in it it just won't seem to run out so I use I double up because it'll press through the parchment paper which is not a huge deal so yeah you just put the button in here give it a press there you go we're just gonna wait for that heat up and once it's ready will squish somebod all right now that the temperature plates are heated up what I'm gonna need to do is take this puck right here and slide it between the plates just like this and you want it to be just kind of centered like that and towards the front a little bit is what I prefer so that it can kind of direct it to come out that way yeah that's just right give me a second guys so after I get the puck in here I like to just so I haven't really started to put much pressure at all on it right now it's just strictly heating up at this point all right so it's been heating up for over a minute now so I go ahead and just start a timer right when I start applying pressure to this and I'm just going to try it as much as I can just keep applying steady pressure to this and I usually take it up to the 4000 on the PSI scale rear and then I'll be able to swing this camera in right here so that we can help you of the drip close-up so let's go ahead and get that started all right it's starting to start the timer as soon as I start to feel the resistance of the pump all right I can feel it so now I'm gonna start it I'm gonna do one minute for the first squish probably not the most exciting quite yeah I'm actually gonna swing that hammer right now hopefully we'll get a nice view of the squish going on all right well I'm a little bit over a minute and we don't get no squishies out of here I guess I don't have enough in there or it's not gonna yield as much as it would need to make a squish that's been in there long enough though so I'm gonna go ahead pull it and to do that undo this toppling like over here what's probably going on here is it just didn't have enough didn't have enough trichomes and stuff to push it out at that temperature all right nice and aromatic that is there's the first squish you say I'm going through the paper there a little bit that's all right we get it put that in the freezer all right so I put the first squish in the freezer and then we'll go ahead and get the second stick ready this is the same thing over again [Music] looks like the bag broke a little bit on that one I went a little too fast so you know usually I try to go pretty slow didn't work out that time so now I'm gonna put the temperature up to 210 degrees all right so I've turned up the temperature to 210 degrees on the plates I like to do that first press at 180 to get as many Terps and you know the nicest press that I can and then I go up to 210 after that to get as much as I can out of now I'll even go up to 220 for the last one so once this is all heated up then I'll be ready to do the second press I've got the plates up to 210 degrees and I've got the puck here so I'm just gonna slide there we go let that heat up just about 30 seconds or a minute or so all right now that it has heated up for about a minute I'm gonna go ahead and start putting some pressure on it this time I'm gonna take it slower so I don't totally destroy it I'm just trying to apply even pressure as much as I can throughout the whole time hid key to sort of get a little tougher up in these thousands give you a nice arm workout well it looks like there's a little bit coming out this time all right a little bit didn't have this already did a about 220 it's starting to drip and I've gone longer than a minute that's for sure I'm missing all of this camera tank sorry this is so bad there we go a bit more pressure just a little bit more now that we got it hurtin and it's just such dark rosin I'm not used to that but same thing happened with the other batch of three boys that I pressed so who knows all right that's plenty of time not too shabby on the second place smells nice it's kind of hippy all right so now we're gonna get the third press down here I'm gonna put this into the freezer let harden up all right so now that the plates are heated up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit I'm ready to go ahead and put the puck in but first I'm gonna have a little shot glass of water right here and I'm gonna just dab a little bit of water on each side of it now just help push out the last of the dabs last of the rosin I should say just that pressure of the vapor a little bit just a little bit of pressure so I can start heating up plates heat up the puck for about a minute or so to bring it up to temperature and that's just to help get the juices flowing basically all right now that the puck has heated up in the press for about a minute I'll go ahead and start applying more pressure slowly as I go at 220 degrees Fahrenheit and hopefully we'll see a little bit come out again it's always nice when you get to see the drip don't see any coming out yet tighten up a little bit still nothing look we should definitely be getting more rosin out that's for sure oh here comes something right there very nice very nice third press and since this is the last press I'll just let this go throw away for a minute and a half two minutes you can pretty good this is on the prison prettiest rosin I've seen that's for sure mm-hmm but I'm sure see what the yield is like press that's a pretty decent press right there for the third press but you can see it is there's a lot less of it Wow very nice berry flavor to this last press interesting what if the water help right now all right so I'll put this in the freezer like the other ones and then it will be back with all of them once they're all frozen and we'll gather them up and I'll tell you what the yield was all right so here I've got the first press and I collect it now as you can see I went through the paper but that's not a huge deal you still get this all up alright so I've got the first press collected and there it is as you can see there's you know there's some stuff on here there's no all my fingers but that's the vast majority of it right there I'm just going to throw it onto a piece of parchment paper for right now and then we'll weigh them all up together at the end get as much of this off as I can but it won't be exact that's for sure mark this is number one I set it over here all right now on to collect the second press here we had the second press and I hope it'll be easier than the first to collect nope it's shattering - let's see how it does that's not so bad all right and here's the second press put this on a piece of parchment also this has got like a taffy consistency to it label that number two and we'll collect the third and final press and then we'll weigh it all up and see what our yield was - stuff like this of course don't touch your rug further than final price right here so I'm going to collect it and you'll know just exactly how much we got is the third press right there number one go ahead and tear out the scale with a piece of the parchment on it sure it's not touching here we go got that tear it out now I'll transfer attached to this parchment and that is point one seven five grams from the first press and it has a really interesting consistency to it it's waxy it's like it's barely even sticky I mean it is but it's nothing like the other pretty cool so I'll mark this you tell the batch number then I'm gonna put it back in the freezer I'll grab the second one all right there's the second batch go ahead and tear out the scale again just like before transfer it over easier to do when it's frozen make sure it's not touching yep not touching 0.18 one second do it a little bit better than the first one which is not surprising because the second one had 210 degrees well unit 108 so there's not as much energy to push out all that rosin all right and they go ahead and tear out the last one transfer one more time whoops I have to wait a trick on this one here we go make sure it's not touching all right it's point zero seven eight there's a tiny bit more on here let me get that so I put this there was a little bit left on there I don't see what's a point seven eight so didn't really add a point seven eight point seven nine point eight let me close this really point seven nine twenty seven eight I'll just call it point seven eight 0.078 all right so label this one this one is a lot stickier look at that it's a lot stickier and that's the last one it has the water so now we'll add these all up and see what our yield was 175 that's point one a one plus point zero seven eight equals point four three four 12.4% yield man that is not good you at all it's just terrible and this is the same thing that happened last time that I pressed this stuff you know I mean I realize look you got a little bit right here but man this is some bad yield right here for 20% so I don't know what the deal is with these I definitely get a lot more out of Tru leave and let's see well if I Curie if gave me some good stuff to so let me mark this off for number three and then we'll take a look at the different batches together here's that one as you can see I mean it doesn't even want to stick to the paper you see that it's hard it barely wants to stick to the paper if you touch it it will stick to your finger because of the heat but other than that it really doesn't want to stick let's batch one at 180 degrees that's too similar but it is a little bit stickier and it seems to be a little unruly or two you see how it's like flakes off like that yeah I don't really like touching batch two very much I'm gonna get rid of it well we just ahead of my fingers and then batch three as we put the water in it much more of an oily consistency and just like before this is all really dark stuff compared to what I'm used to I will press some buds from a you know different dispensary soon and we'll see well you'll see the difference I don't I don't get it I don't understand what the deal is but I mean I would think that the first one would be a nicer color than that but the thing is this stuff is really potent and the smell is nice it concentrates all that smell down from the bud alright guys I just wanted to show you how I press rosin at home and next time I'll make sure and use a screen that gives us a little bit better stuff you know I just had this kicking around for a while now and I figured I might as well get something out of it what I'll do is I think I'll do one more press on this at some other point and I'll tell you if I get anything else out of it alright thanks for watching you guys have a good one", "obhYSf1ogoo": "if you've ever been to his Space Center or Science Museum then there's a good chance he'll have tried astronaut ice cream astronaut ice cream is like regular ice cream makes it completely dry it's made using a process called lyophilization but most people just call it freeze drying freeze dryers are great because they let you dehydrate things while letting them maintain their shape best of all because no keet is used to dry the items there's no caramelization so foods retain all of their flavor while astronaut ice cream is fun there's lots of other uses for freeze dryers you've probably heard of aerogel but if you heard of cryo gel it's the same concept but uses a freeze dryer to make it a materials first turned into a gel and then frozen and freeze-dried the ultralight foams this produces are useful and everything from cell culture to super capacitors rocket engines solar cells and more for scientific use freeze dryers are a great way to preserve samples and things like proteins that can't be stored wet but also can't be heated to dry I needed a freeze dryer for my research so I thought that this was a great opportunity to show how these cool devices work and how to build one I tried to make this as easy as possible so I went with materials that were easy to get on Amazon or at a local hardware store and can be assembled with minimal tools a freezer only has two pieces the drying chamber and the water trap as water leaves the drying items the water crap condenses it so it doesn't go into the vacuum pump that runs the system I chose stainless steel and acrylic vacuum chambers for this as their convenient size for small samples and will be easy to control their temperature I'll be using a 1/4 is the drying chamber and a 1 gallon chamber is my water trap in hindsight I wish I'd just gotten 2 of the 1 quart chambers or reversed which ones I used for which part of the machine I think the 1 gallon was a bit big so keeping it completely cool was difficult and I worried that there's too much air space so some of the water won't get trapped either way the water trap needs to be deep cooled and to do that we'll be suspending it in some DIY cryo fluid which we'll be using this two gallon pot to hold to insulate everything I've got some styrofoam sheets the Chamber's come with almost all the plumbing we need which is one of the reasons I chose them but to make them fully functional we'll need a 1/4 inch Union a 5/8 inch splice or barbed ends some 5/8 inch tubing with braided reinforcements finally we'll need a rotary two-stage vacuum pump I have a rather nice pump but some of the roben air models can get to the correct pressure the thing to keep in mind is that you need a really deep vacuum for this to work properly the chamber pressure needs to get well below 300 millet or ideally around 100 millet or the reason for this is the physics that makes this machine work when you look at the phase diagram for water you can see how at different temperatures and pressures it's in different phases in this lower part you can see that if we decrease the pressure and temperature in the chamber water can go directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation this is why freeze-dried items retain their shape the water is a solid and acts like a scaffold holding everything in place while the item dries by the time the water sublimates away the materials dry enough to support itself so when choosing a vacuum pump be sure to get a pump that can go down to at least 100 Millett or you probably won't get that far because of gas in the chamber from all the sublimating water but it'll get you far enough for the effect to happen properly okay let's get to building and we'll start with the water crop the first job is to insulate the pot as best as possible to keep everything cold after measuring the two gallon pot and spacing it out so that it'll have the same amount of insulation on all sides I cut out the first piece of styrofoam I use this as a template to cut out more pieces until I had a stack then went up to the handles of the pot then I cut three more to act as the bottom with the stack prepared I carefully centered the pot on the first piece of styrofoam and traced around it before cutting out circle after checking the fit on the pot I repeated this for the rest of my stack checking the fit periodically to make sure the pot fits easily remember not to cut the bottom three pieces as those are going to be used as our bottom now all the pieces can be glued together to make this permanent I just used white glue for this because it's what I had on hand spray adhesive would have made this a lot easier I cleaned up any glue leaks and then check the fit of the pot while I was drying I cut out another piece of styrofoam to act as sort of a lid over the pot I measured the diameter of the large vacuum chamber and the inner diameter of the pot and marked them out on the styrofoam before cutting it out I also cut a small area out of the ring so I can drop dry ice into the liquid that will be in here the actual drying chamber requires very little work straight out of the box all we need to do is upgrade the gauge the little gauge that comes with it or cheap and Max out quickly so we need a proper digital vacuum gauge to see what if we're actually getting down to pressure to be able to attach it I added a 1/4 inch union I didn't film it but be sure to use high-grade on tape to make sure the seal is good otherwise it'll leak and screw up your pressure the gauge you'll be using is a field piece SVG three it's the same model I used in the last vacuum video for those of you wondering attaching it doesn't require teflon tape because of a built-in oring and so it can just be tightened on with pipe wrench the water trap chamber requires a bit more effort but it's still really easy to assemble first the vacuum gauge that comes with the chamber is removed then if I faint inch spade bit is used to widen the hole to fit our barbed splicer clean up any burrs and then mix up some jb weld and yes it really does need to be JP weld it's one of the few epoxies that's readily available and rated for vacuum work apply the Jaypee will do the splicer and then press it into place I'm using JB quick because I'm lazy and impatient but regular JB wild is preferred when the JB walled is dry the five-eighths inch tubing can be attached to this chamber and the vacuum pump with some hose clamps I ended up having to come back to these and add more jb weld inside the tubing to help get a good seal because it was leaking slightly vacuum grease would have been much better for this but I didn't have any on hand for those worried the vacuum pump side barbed is removable which is why I did this I'd never just epoxy a tube directly to a vacuum pump some last changes that I made later were to add a styrofoam box around the small chamber to help keep it cold so that freeze-drying items don't fall too quickly I would also throw a little bit of dry ice in there to keep things cold as things dry out it's okay if they warm up a bit so you don't need to top this up too often the last change was to add some weight inside of the cold trap and to use a little bit of string to tie it to the two gallon pot to hold it unfortunately it's extremely buoyant so without some sort of weight it tends to just float and not get completely covered by the cryo fluid okay let's give this thing a test drive first off a quick safety warning we're dealing with deep vacuums and cryogenic temperatures be very careful and wear appropriate safety equipment don't handle dry ice with your bare hands or you will get burned having had that happen myself I can say it's not fun just wear gloves you don't need much of a barrier but that little bit of insulation makes the difference between cold hands and burnt ones before we can fire this up we're gonna need something to freeze dry I'm going with a classic and started with some strawberries I got some fresh berries and then slice them up this is to help expose as much surface area as possible is feet up drying the sliced berries are then placed in a bag and sandwiched carefully between two blocks of dry ice allow for about an hour for these to freeze fully as those are freezing let's get the system ready first up we need to get the water trapped cold fill the two gallon pot with a large amount of denatured alcohol and then slowly start adding dry ice it'll boil vigorously at the beginning but eventually it'll slow down after a while things will get cold enough to maintain their temperature for a little bit to make sure the system requires less frequent tending I actually lifted the pot up and put a whole block of dry ice underneath this work to keep everything cold for many hours I was even able to leave this overnight without tending it either way it's best to tend the system for the first while just to make sure that everything is working top up the dry ice before leaving it alone for a while if you don't put the block underneath you're going to need to tend it and top it up at least every hour a quick note if you're lazy or in a rush and want your items frozen faster just put the bag in the cryo fluid for a minute or two everything will be flash frozen and ready for use very quickly when the strawberries were frozen I transferred them to a silicon mat that came with the chamber and then place them into the drying chamber close everything up turn the valve so outside air can't get in but gases can flow between the chambers and then fire up the pump everything should get down to pressure really quickly if your digital gauge isn't doing anything it's because the pressure is too high and you probably have a leak luckily these chambers are well made so the only real potential leak spots are the tubing we added and where the gauge is attached with everything running all we have to do is wait keep the water trapped as cold as possible over the next six to fourteen hours while the items dry if everything goes according to plan this is what you should end up with some perfectly dried strawberries that still have most of the shape since no heat we use to dry these they still maintain all of their flavor compounds in a more or less pristine state so there's no caramel flavor and everything is light and fluffy not chewy or bendy here's a comparison of strawberries dried in the dehydrator with heat at a freeze dryer the difference is really obvious an important note is how critical the pressure is if the pressure isn't low enough all you'll end up with is some strawberry mush as I found out on my first run when I still had a bit of a leak you'll be seeing a lot more of this machine in the near future and we'll be looking at all sorts of cryo gels and their amazing properties as cellular scaffolds cryo gel can be perfect for all sorts of cell culture techniques at some point I'll be using the freeze dryer and then the kiln to make some extremely light carbon phones so be sure to check

bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios

recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text

guys epicenter Brian here hey today I'm going to start a sequence of some tips for you guys now some of these tips are gonna be for new users some of them are going to be for everybody this one happens to be for everybody and we're going to be talking about the drain tube and that's where the water comes out when you do your defrosting of the chamber okay and most people use a bucket like this to catch the the water and the big thing is you want to make sure you get in the habit of emptying that bucket every time you defrost okay because if it builds up you also run the risk of having this one catastrophic thing happen to you and every single one of us have done this once and that is if the drain hose is actually sitting in the water when you open the valve then it really causes problems and I'm going to show you exactly what happens okay then I'm going to show you a little device that we're going to put in line with that that is gonna help prevent that in the event that you mess up I've taken the the rack out and the wire is just sitting in there we've got a camera here that's gonna catch that and we have a pump running over here and right now I'm just gonna go ahead and turn that pump off and we have a good vacuum doesn't really matter what the value is but this is what happens okay so normally you'd come over here to open your your valve and I'm gonna just kind of angle this a little bit so you can see what happens in this hose and here we go oh you hear that we just had water shooting on into our chamber that's probably enough let me just close that but you can see what a disaster this has just caused now that water has sprayed and gotten on all of your dried food in there which means you have to rerun the bat but it gets even worse if you don't clean this bucket periodically then that could be some nasty water and it means you're probably gonna have to throw out all the food that you just did okay like I said this has happened to everybody once and you know that the only thing you could do is is open that Valve slowly and and look to see if something's coming up that hose but the easiest thing to do is just get in that habit and go ahead also and install something like this it's super cheap insurance and I'll show you what's involved alright we've installed a couple of these fittings let me show you what it looks like so with two of them you see that the hose remain straight of course it's in the bucket of water right now and I like the way this particular part works out you know you can get something like this in plastic at any auto parts store but it's gonna be a y-you know it'll be shaped like that and you really need two of these installed to get enough air flow so that so that the vacuum can't pull up the column of water up that pipe okay so the cheapest way of course are with the plastic ones but anyway I decided to go with these I like the way the the hose lays and you know it remains straight and everything they're not cheap they're stainless they're about twenty bucks for a pair anyway if you can't find something that you like and you like this idea I could probably sell you a pair just get it get in touch with me you know you can go to our website and send an email and I can arrange to do that for you so anyway we're all set up we're gonna do this again let me just turn off the pump real quick okay now over here we're gonna open this valve up and here we go okay and like I said you do absolutely have to have two of these or it doesn't provide enough air to keep the water from sucking up the pipe okay so that's about it you see that that works very very well and really prevented any kind of problems so hope you guys liked that tip and that's about it for today for the epicenter comm i'm epicentre bryan signing out", "GYbQtkxx6RI": "Oh [Music] [Music] water hash hacks so our first tank today is going to be how to create a shield this is a picture of a shield just cut the bottom off a bucket then use the shield on the inside of your work bag as seen here this helps keep your bag from drifting to the middle and will help protect it from your drill or your paddle or whatever you're using the mixer batch our next hack for today is going to be using a siphon we have just pulled out our work bag and here we see our hash water in the bucket one of the easiest ways the siphon this water out is to use a 25 micron screen like this it's easier to push the bag down into the water than it is to dump the whole bucket through the bag get a pan or a small bucket to place the hose in you just need something to stop the screen from getting sucked into the hose another way to do this is to let your hash water settle for about 20 minutes and very gently place your pan on the bottom of your hash water bucket then siphon out of your pan to a bucket with your 25 micron screen bag catching all the water if you do that just in case anything good does sneak out on [Music] now that took me about five minutes and you can see all the hash is left in just a small amount of water that's a lot less to deal with and it saves your back and your time another little trick is when you're dealing with multiple runs is you can just mix them together you can do this easily if you're using the siphon method I'll mix my first runs together and my second runs together that's what you see here the mixing of two different runs now let them settle and pour it off later which brings us to our last hack of the day rinsing your hash this trick works especially well when dealing with low quality trim so now just fill the buckets with fresh water and let them sell for 20 minutes before pouring them off if you're in a hurry you can use the bag and the siphon and then you won't have to wait for them to settle [Music] [Music] now I've let those buckets settle for 20 minutes and I'm going to just pour them off slowly you can see this stuff's pretty clean already you'll still see some small debris that gets out once in a while there's still a little bits of stuff in there now with the clearness of the water you can start to see the hash down there at the bottom and now you can see a little hash trail trying to make its way to the rim so we'll stop it about there and now that's all of our hash and just that little bit of water I'm pouring these into a 25 micron Bay to catch anything good that gets out if it looks good enough I will add to my second runs or I will just use it for cooking I like to repeat this process until I can see the hash sitting on the bottom of a bucket full of clear water [Music] I have been dumping buckets in that bag all day most of the time it'll pull straight out with a little or no resistance so it is holding a little more water than usual but still easy to pull and it's draining pretty quick [Music] when i zoom in here you can see there is some stuff stuck to that bag it is a little dirty well happy hashing age [Music] [Music]", "NTFaTDreGPk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "LBd3nmFBEoU": "so of everybody has a so mash strawberry-banana bubble - that's the first run also had was a two and half ounces of uh smalls left so I'm running it twice since that's the last bit that I have and see how much I can get anyways got poured it back in the bag okay it's like a frosty or icy so people if you don't know what's going on with this you pretty much throw your weed in these bags put a bunch of ice and water in about half and half stir it up or spin it up with the drill whatever whatever you do and it knocks all the THC crystals off of the weed because the ice it freezes the trichrome heads and they break off and they filter through the bags and you get all the different different sized crystals and just all the good stuff comes through and all the UH all the plant material stays in the filter so yeah that's uh", "UKYpi07Z3Pg": "in this video we will talk about how terpenes influence your cannabis choice terpenes are highly aromatic compounds that determine the smell of many plants and some animals an example of this would be to think of terpenes as notes when you're tasting wines or the hop flavor when you're drinking beer here are some popular terpenes found in cannabis amnesia haze is recognized for its uplifting buzz and has been known to contain karyophiline lemony and mircine granddaddy purple is recognized for its sedative effects and has been known to have mircine as its dominant terpene but also a noticeable amount of piney understanding the terpene taste of the strain will allow you to find strains that will be more enjoyable and at the same time will help you avoid the strains that are not thanks for watching i hope the information helps", "Wkd2za5_w_E": "all right hey guys this is rich at dog town innovative products okay so today I want to show you how to run the bubble bowls ultimate kit with a vacuum system people have asked me how to run the kit when they're processing high volume and I want to show you that you can do it with the ultimate kit and a vacuum system so what we got going on here is I have just your standard wet/dry vac that you can get from any Home Center and I drilled a port inside the bucket this is these are seven gallon buckets by the way which you can find online so I just drilled that hole the same size as my hose here you don't need any special attachments or fittings or anything like that and then you can just take your kit and set it right on top of the bucket here and so you'll want to make the sure that it's centered and that vacuum is just going to create a vacuum chamber out of this bucket and draw your water straight through so like I said I'm using seven gallon buckets I have a second bucket here ready to go so I've actually done two seven gallon work bag processes and this will demonstrate how to use the vacuum system to keep just running your water through without it backing up so if you can envision once you see the process you'll see how you can adapt this to a twenty gallon trash can and just use your regular hose and gravity feed for every about five and a half or six gallons you'll have to switch over to another bucket or empty the water in your vacuum chamber all right so I'll show you what's going on here I got the ultimate kit which is the 160 micron Bowl I got a 120 micron Bowl got the 90 micron bowl we've got the 68 micron Bowl we've got 53 my bowl and we got the 30 micron Bowl so what we want to do with these before we get going is pressing together get a nice tight seal between the bowls so they kind of want to stick together like that okay again we're going to put that right on the center of that stack so with my work bag process again I use seven gallon buckets and your ultimate kit comes with an all mesh work bag that fits in that seven gallon bucket so I'm going to get going here I have like I said have two seven gallon buckets ready to go and pour through the system it's fresh frozen a whole plant mix normally I'll separate the bud from the leaf but I wanted to get a little more volume so to show you how to do the high-volume processing alright so one important thing is before you get there's some stuff around over here before you get pouring into the bowls you'll want to start your vacuum motor if you port through and let it back up a little bit you can hit the motor and it will clear up right away but you get a pop of air from the underside and that could throw your extracts back up so up into the mesh the low above it so keep that in mind the way to get around that is just to start your motor before you start pouring so that's what we're going to do right now all righty so there you go on to say that this whole stack is cleared there's our 160 there's our 120 there's our 90 there's our 68 there's our 53 and there's our 30 so I'm going to go ahead and just set this bike up side grab this other stack here grab this other bucket right inside the court put the stack back again make sure it's on the center make sure they're pressed together tightly start that motor important all right so there you go we got the whole stack is cleared it's our 160 there's our 120 there's our 90 and that looks like that's where we got most of our catch the stuff in the 120 and the 90 are usually the best stuff sometimes a 62 the 68 looks like we got some good stuff in there 53 more green to it but I didn't overwork this stuff and really not much in the fridge so there you go you see how to clear the system really quickly like I said you could probably get away with one stack with for 120 gallon system if you're using a 30 gallon or 55 gallon you may want to add a second stack a third stack and go modular you don't need one big bowl you can go modular at a second third static all righty there you go that's how to run large volume processes with the bubble bolts thanks", "wqdyULUfHXo": "hi I'm Andrew with virtual Sun hydroponics today I'm

herbal extraction bag kits include a bonus sturdy drawstring storage bag and 25 micron press screen and no extra cost virtual Sun herbal extraction bags produce the finest herbal extract so let's get started you will need a wooden mixing spoon or electric mixer to stir the product today we are going to use a combination of a power drill with a mixing blade and a wooden spoon a thin flat plastic blade to remove the finished product from the bags we will be using a four-inch plastic putty knife your plant matter we will be using lavender buds today to make lavender essence a multi-purpose bucket or trash can the same size as your herbal extraction bags we will be using a five-gallon multi-purpose bucket a large bag of ice and your herbal extraction bags today we have our virtual Sun five gallon five bag herbal extraction bag kit step one stack your bags always put the smallest micron bag in first this will usually be the 25 micron bag each of the additional bags will be stacked on top of each other from smallest micron the largest our five bags set today stacks 2573 120 160 to 20 micron the 220 micron strainer bag will end up on top every time all the bags can be used at once or each bag can be used separately step 2 add ice fill the bucket one third full of ice step three add the plant matter start adding the plant material today we are using lavender buds to produce lavender essence spread the materials slowly over the ice continue until the bucket is about half full step four add water add cold water until the bucket is about three-quarters full make sure to use cold water room temperature or warm water will not work properly step 5 mix mix everything together consistently until it turns frothy like foamy green tea after you mix all of your ingredients let it sit for about 10 minutes for proper extraction step 6 strain stir repeat pull the largest micron bag out and slowly strain the liquid into the second bag dispose of the remaining product in the bag or set it aside to reprocess later plant matter can be reprocessed two to three times for maximum yield pull each of the remaining bags and slowly strain the liquid through the bottom into the next bag step 7 finished product all of the bags except the 220 micron strainer bag will have usable product in the motor remove from the bucket the finished product we have is lavender essence once it's been dried it can be used for potpourri candles perfume cooking or cleaning there are many uses for herbal extracts and powders thanks for watching we hope this video has been informative step-by-step PDF instructions are available to help you or watch it again you", "DUJ3W85ZmMw": "hey what's happening I changed in the tube here the drain hose on the bubble now a hash washing machine figured I'd do a little video all you do is pop this little door off the back with two screws and cut the original hose off this one here with all the ribs it catches all your hash keeps it for itself but you just cut that right off with a knife get a hose three-quarter inch interior diameter and slide that get it warm put it in warm water if you get especially if you get this good sturdy one that I got and I don't know weasel its way right in there and connect right there put the hose clamp on and then I just did a 90 in a cat there so there it is another little tip if you don't want to pay the couple hundred bucks for the bubble now sticker you can get a cost way on Amazon for 60 bucks it's the same machine I got two of them this one that I got the one with the hundred dollar stickers so it's up to you I'm glad I supported bubble man on this one he's taught people a lot and so I'm glad to pay it I guess for one but to cheap to pay it for two so there you go and then put that door back on and get to washing pace", "sk9BI0-7A2o": "[Music] welcome back guys Johnny B and me in the house and we're about to fresh frozen dude I'm so excited that you came by with the fresh frozen watermelon today yeah no that's a birthday treat for real what kind of friend brings this problem now of course I'm not keeping the resins but just to be able to make it and smoke it with John to me is a perfect most beautiful of birthday gift so I've actually got a rarity here that you haven't seen yet I've got all three of the bunk bed kits that we're selling right now from the original the top grade warrantied for life durable as a mofo except that I have yeah exactly that's the professional house makers kit that's the most expensive fog gallon aid bag kit that comes in at 320 plus dollars number two which still has all the colors right just a slightly lower GSM thread count the bags are still quality right and I use an outside bag to change the color to show people that this is not an original kit so that they shouldn't be paying the original price this bag is about $50 cheaper this kit I basically passed the savings on of the slightly cheaper material for the bags and the cheaper out outer material and basically patch that right on to the customer so that bag comes in at about 270 thanks Canadians hey are you much sorry and then the final ones which unfortunately these look a little smaller than those other two kits because I only had a 1 gallon kit and these were fives but pretend this is a 5 gallon kit now these are the lights and these are the ones where I really went out hard on the savings I changed everything there's no eight colors like I took away the eight colors and put only three colors which was a pretty massive savings for me being able to not have to buy eight rolls of full color which is you know it's everything everything adds up it's very expensive to buy eight separate roll I was able to pass on a huge savings on the eight bag five-gallon kit of the lights at just a hundred fifty bucks that's like half price it's less than a half price for the original so you know what just lots of people always asking for deals and always asking for cheaper set so I like to accommodate we give deals and we have three different sets that can accommodate you for whatever your priced price it's not to sound too much like an infomercial cuz I like the fact that John and ionize videos are more chill and more real but I I never talked about the bags that much and this is a good time to do it and we use these ones already we use the lights and one of our other video exactly and we've used the originals I did the originals with Remo I believe and it's just a matter of one day running but it's your birthday today so what bags you use well for my birthday I'm using the top-of-the-line 100% full lifetime warranty bubble bag originals course you know and man that's soft like if you're going to travel with this bad boy as a hash maker across the [ __ ] plains of Afghanistan sleeping in the mountains you know and I open I think we might actually try and do that I think we will do that after Jamaica which we're gonna do in a couple of weeks we're gonna be in Jamaica in a couple weeks with Tony potentially Chibs Scott from rare dankness and a few other people I've invited down for kind of just a real cool hey let's get together and have an amazing time in Jamaica go hang out with some cool artists and Kingston go to a couple of cool parties meet the Rasmus go into the hills make hash isn't that what it's all about oh that's just like sweet alright so Johnny Cash John is brought over the watermelon today we've got the fret I won't pull it up just yet because we should fill when we fill this we will need the herb better go so we're gonna use the bubble now for our mixing and we're gonna use the barrel shaped bags I know a lot of people love their triangle-shaped bags which I will be bringing to market soon spoke with a few different people recently nicotine being one of them offered him pyramid shaped bags cuz we can of course manufacture any style of bag that people request if there's any professional Hashmi out there that want their own specialty kind of bag you know get in touch with us we'll make you anything you want and one thing you know about bubble bags and fresh Shetty's is that we make quality products that's it's a good offer anyway so we're gonna do the fresh frozen how much did you bring weight out of or hunter grams of wet for 400 grams and that's the watermelon that's the what a memo you showed me at the front door oh god dude you know it smells down here they just go up to the camera and show them this glisten the negative perfection whoa isn't solid it's pretty frozen dude look at that that resin was so sticky I did do a video of it alright layer of ice this is my birthday treat Johnny happy birthday oh it feels like little icy trichome rocks okay more ice now yeah now we're gonna put the chosen make nice little layer of ice and then a layer of or so yeah you can put more ice in excellent you basically want to make it so the ice is covering that layer of herb pretty much completely which it is they're perfectly yep we're going up for the camera okay just barely touch this herb a little bit God is that nice now you can put a bunch of more ice I'm just I just put that back in the ice right there [Music] I've done this before with me and without with in with them this is a perfectly that father was the 400 grams it knocks this bag perfectly yeah I was getting used to it I like my little Rubbermaid bin so once that's all the fresh I know I'm ready good to go and this the 2.5 gallon nine point five liter bin that I'm using good sign John we have five nice pieces of ice here perfect there we go back Sean so today we're gonna use ice in the bubble now machine as well nice just because our water is not necessarily gonna be the coldest coldest coldest you could start turning that water on now actually I will let that water run because it is an outdoor hose in a black hose sitting out in the Sun when it first comes out it can be pretty warm and we're pretty blessed with our water that just fits Oh perfect uh no real it's gonna be nice I can't even tell you how good that TGA strain smells I call it watermelon all the time it is the Astro Boy from TGA and it is a really nice strength there you go but I was gonna put some ice in here to pour in there so we're using the bubble bag originals I'll get rid of the lights and the standards and there's one more little bud I found would you like to put some ice in there so you keep that for photography reasons later nice it's on the gun no stuck to my fingers so good boy one away we will but what we're gonna have to do first to get a little of this mounted because it's such a perfect amount we basically filled this that's the cool thing about the the barrel shaped bag is that it fills the Machine perfectly and just allows you to mix as though the Machine the bag isn't even there you know what I mean that's what I love about this bag that's why I'm so surprised when I hear people say that they prefer the triangle bag and that they're getting a bigger yield and they get it I get my yield I get what is there I never get less you know what I mean if there's 10% that's what I'm gonna get and having a barrel shaped bag certainly isn't going to be it isn't going to make it that I get any less let's get some water on that yeah we'll bring over the hose over here I'm just gonna pass if I'm the camera here I think it'll just reach if we're lucky we're lucky I think we just happen to perfect there we go so we've had the pressure turned down there so we could do this we got lucky there I got it awesome you know I know this is good come you know what I want you to do come around and dab me out a bowl with the D nail I'm gonna be amazed you know that's great about that sliminess I can reach in here with a nice little ball yeah it's awesome all right oh yeah there you go dabbing and filling up the bucketful ice here getting the bubble now going it's just very nice asking beautiful oh that's nice what did we dab up there number two and three [ __ ] oh gee I like that pack indeed it is a very nice play I'm sure I like it a lot it isn't yeah this is filling up beautifully perfect yeah you're just hearing now what's getting up to the top which is great oh not even close it's actually about halfway perfect yeah and luckily it's got quite a bit of distance about an inch and a half all the way around the whole thing that can fill with water excellent yeah you know you don't want to take away all your water the water is definitely a very important component of making water hash water and ice always what you say keep it cold mmm-hmm keep it and I'll have you all know that this hose nozzle was cleaned by myself before I stuck it in here I made sure to get all the particulates or any little pieces that were on it off and I cleaned it up real nice I've been getting a lot of sort of flak lately because I show people how to make a bubble and of course I like to show them how to make it properly but I also like to show people how to do it easily with whatever they have available for where they are not everyone can afford an expensive hash lab with machines and ice makers and AH rows and so for those people it's nice to be able to show them a way to to be able to hand mix and you know how to get your house dry properly and all those things all right now we're getting close to the top okay I'm gonna turn that off so I'm about maybe two inches from the top and the reason I'm leaving that distance this is nice too now the bag will go sideways and upside down so I got it nice and upside-down all tied up we're gonna do about a ten-minute mix today and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna pull some bags for you nice and quickly the bubble now has been filled with water ice and herb john told us we put 400 grams of fresh frozen in there which is probably around 100 grams so if we can pull out anywhere from 10 to 12 grams of hash and return we've done exceptional so let's get her mix in it's my birthday batch it's your birthday so we're gonna continue to smoke hash while this bad boy continues to make cash yeah I hid yourself some Hoss oh you're nuts oh me oh well alrighty then stoked kind of let's make a hash in her birthday it's your birthday and always hitting it nice and all someone was saying though we take big bong rips I think no I think it's the quality of house that we're smoking you think we're taking a big one but it's so smooth it was pretty big okay let's bigger than normal what is your how can you not do a big birthday trip who's delicious that sauce that's nice too the more water and the more ice more ice [Applause] more ice merrier yeah you're gonna get a great extraction ratio [Applause] John's got the parchment paper here we've got pizza boxes four of them spread out which will be more than enough for 10 to 12 grams it's always great to use less hash for large area the more surface area the better and we've got the parchment paper unbleached for putting overtop of the cardboard I get so much flak for people a harsh and on me for cardboard I show you the cardboard because it's available to most people of course if you can have parchment paper and you've gone to your store and got some that's great just make sure in high humid areas that it's not stopping the wicking I do worry about the wax paper esque miss of the material but here we got John he's just gonna fold up the edges and we're folding up the edges on the parchment paper to just make like a little protected area so the bubble doesn't you know fall or get knocked off the parchment and we're gonna continue we're gonna tape the parchment as well onto cardboard thank you sir you're very welcome always nice to give a friend hand especially when it's you know about birthday hash patches there you go all right so that's pretty quick just picking the four together like huh yeah once it stays up nice nice little box that's perfect for keeping the bubble hash safe all right well let's go see if if it's time for us to pull the bank's tape down the corners a little bit looks yellow and smell it [Applause] it's almost like a beige yellow I'm totally excited to go how cool that is I can feel it when I opened it it nice and we're gonna get these bad boys working real soon [Applause] [Applause] all right we're back and our bubble now has just stopped mixing we did about a ten-minute err sample 10 minutes and water is pretty trippy it's almost like now that is funky I don't even know how to describe it it's got this light light green but the green is like a good it's golden oh I want to say smell my fingers but I'm not smelling a finger it's so yeah feel free to have a sip I always like to taste my rather a problem there's definitely resin you can see it floating right on the top in that right yeah it's nice hey yes I like it so we are gonna put the bags in the bucket real quick this doesn't have to take a long time and I'll just go through the colors and the micron sizes you start with the purple the 25 micron it's the smallest screen make sure our bag is nice our bucket is nice and clean because I do remember we got a little few nuggets that fell in there otherwise the only thing that's ever gone in this bucket is hash so not bad alright so 25 micron going into a clean bubble bubble bucket yeah we don't even have to turn it over but you can it's definitely not as necessary takes a lot longer if you want to do all the bags but it does help keep the screen nice open 45 micron the white this is our second bag and it's definitely a bag that produces no shortage of resin that comes out of the 45 micron bag really regardless ADA stream it's what I be pumping lately I mean that smoke is I'm 45 my little pony 73 micron that means he's out of 90 73 120 but it still goes to show you that it's worth puffing I'm actually doing a little bit of watermelon on top of that excellent so this was 73 yellow I'm not sure if I mentioned that I might have I might not have we've been dabbing bowls so there's 73 yellow used to be the gold bag until the black bag came along and stole its thunder yes the black bag is my favorite bag and it is the 90 micron today on this day of 90 micron I wear all black and honor of my friend Xavier from medical seats rocking the medical seat shirt that's job is there awesome oh great time with those guys just good dudes they can't wait til they come here we can show them you know our style we got beeping and bangin and beacon and dancer number 120 micron orange so that night it was a pretty a pretty good ad in from the 122 the 73 everything between the 120 and the 73 is delicious and awesome and you loved it but there were still thoughts that if we separated it it might even be more different and of course it was very glad to have my 1970 separated red 160 micron this is the contaminant bag but can also be a quality bag you know there has been resin that comes out of this bag that is melty I'm huffing on some also 160 no right now really yeah my little pony no I'm also 190 Green sorry to interrupt go ahead oh I'm just saying how tasty that 160 is because I have some good wow this is nice so um you can always try you 169 your 45 you have to be quite pleased if you're a good organic grower you'd be amazed at what you can get but they'll definitely know it's when it's special you'll see right away if you like waiting so this is the 220 now and we're still gonna use it even though that the bag in here the bubble now barrel shaped bag is at 220 I still like to use my 220 bag and just in case filter out any other contaminants that are a large particulate separate out from those smaller screens passion this looks like this bags been mixed once they pulled what was good to keep your bags clean it's good to check the bottoms of your screen sometimes before you shove them into a bucket it's a good idea you can have debris and dirt on the bottom of your screen and now there's some dirt that's right into your good hash and now you don't know how it got there but I'm sitting on the bottom of the 73 or the bottom of the 120 and you pushed it down and when the water and everything went through that little particulate fell right into your hash and it's just one thing to pay attention to so we've got all these now we're going to do the draining a quick little drain just over slightly all right and we'll just do the green on this boom that's exciting yeah that's fun I love this part make it hash they don't what boom you know what it's it's the most exciting part yeah so because this is fresh frozen watermelon and it's a fairly warm day thank God the Sun went a little bit behind the tree there we are in for some quick pulling of bags because when we pull in fact what I would suggest John is the 190 and the 160 no problem but when we get to the 120 I think we should I need to dab you up wick right away all right that there pass me your Tupperware container always make the key for a second one oh absolutely that was that nut so we can whip up a second run so fast to yourself when using fresh frozen of such quality nugget you got to do a second run I just touched it my fingers are sticky well that water was coming out nice and clear adding that extra gallon or two was worked out in our favor you're just gonna unplug this get the bubble now out of the way we go right and we almost killed me actually this will be a table there we go excellent all right so we've got our little area set up here with our bags I'm using a small bucket to flip the bags over and then we've got a spray bucket over here so that we're gonna be able to utilize it spin it in the ice for the whole time so it's excellent all right so even right off the bat there's spring to be done on this bag they do this is great so happy can't wait to see the night on that one bad boy there we go I'm gonna flip it up and you can do some spraying if you like yeah so this is mostly pistol at Harris stigmas big large contaminant if it was bubble it'd be moving a lot faster so this this part will be a little bit slow when you're spraying John's got it about half way cleans now yeah it's definitely I'm sticking really as you can see right now he can you can but it's it's just all right so let's just give it a quick little scoop what we can find we've got the screen nice and wet just give that a little scoop and drop that right there to 20 micron flip this take this here John we'll give it the clean-out over there just like right here it's really convenient that's nice to have that hose you're off camera but what John's doing is he's leaning over the deck right now and he's just cleaning the bag with the hose here I'll give you a little a little visual cleaning the bags with a beautiful ocean view in the background good Johnny no this is nice this is darn nice all right well let's get back to pulling our bags we definitely don't need to spend any wasted time leaving the water in the resin in the water so quick 10-minute rip on the bubble mouth and then pull those bags that was very little in that bag almost nothing see that every day although there is stuff it's kind of spread out on the screen it's invisible because of the orange screen in the sunlight I almost couldn't see it this is more resonance now it's already moving much easier than that other stuff was just pile it into a little spot very small little 190 keep that on and just clean it like that with the easier to clean when it's stretched I often clean my buckets my bag stretched over a bucket like that it's it's held in place it's easier there's no mob eases there's no creases that hold the bag shot in in weird ways and it's just like super quick alright a real small amount of 160 probably because it's just so damn good there's very little contaminants this herb that's something to come very small little piles but also not important piles alright now we're getting more into an important a bag that you want to see some resin in generally is your 120 it's a nice bag to see a little piling never a bad thing yeah a little pile of some some niceness show the camera here little pile of someone 20 goodness this teamwork there you go we're making bubble boom melt on our Gmail what snails by puking be skillet tools for me bubble hash galore alright looks good pick that up oopah so this is the bag that we put in the next bag to come yeah exactly you don't want to lose this resin that's a good point to be remembered by even this little bit of hash that stuck to the spoon right into the 90 quality is there no problem you're definitely not contaminating that bag by any means putting a tiny little bit of 120 in and white and then you'll still make sure we give it a good rinse alright 90 bike bum bag one of my favorites always good when it lifts up with a lot of water there's about a gallon and a half gallon and a half of water in there right now which tells me something's covering the screen at least a little pile this is always nice to get your yield in your 90 bag if you can a bad thing give that 90 you tiny little particulates but if I rinse the bubble around we should be able to pick them out which is like too much use the bottle in a second once I get these new guys Irish three or four just tiny little things that we don't want in there and let me tell you this thing does not want to pick up whatever it is all right you got a bug spray this up in just push the bag up put the lip up on the bag and it makes for easy even easier spring and I can just turn it boy there so you can just stay in one spot whatever works best for you looks like a nice pile there's definitely probably threw three grams there I would say where is that last one 20 was maybe half a gram 73 45 still two more good bags that we're gonna pull oh we're gonna how creamy that is oh it's delicious Rick's on the screen remember these ones need to go through the sieve almost immediately we can't leave this out for too long we can't waste all our time filling all these bags anyway we're gonna have to see some I think yeah that is like trim to the Krampus sound so there's that I'm thinking what I'm gonna do now though is potentially strain that 1/2 hour all right so we've got our parchment paper made into a big square here with the edges done up layer down here and I suggest we do that 90 micron and almost immediately let's get that done right now all right well let these guys see what's going on a little closer so I'm just gonna put the screen right here sure I'm gonna go grab that Oh sounds good man just gonna quickly um oh it looks perfect it looks perfect for micro plane itch for receive it for sea Vitch I should say sorry it was mixed the names huh all right so there's the ninety we're gonna gently rub it through the screen and you can see it's got that perfect right now that it's crumbling perfect so what I would suggest John is use the end okay and you you rather than make it awkward on yourself come back around here I'll show you here I can't show you without showing it there you go basically use the bottom of the spoon on the edge of the screen so I'm gonna try and he's gonna come back I'm gonna show this right here there you go now a lot of it right now is stuck on the outside but I give it a couple of whacks and it's quickly coming off oh that's beautiful look at exactly and see how we put the lip on there because as he's tapping away the lip is actually protecting it from jumping off of the lip is working for us very well yeah it does doesn't it Danis quite happy with that oh but you know what he's getting a little bit excited oh you got to get a little excited we're cleaning this hash off we don't want it stand in our seat we want it on that parchment getting dried all right that was 90 perfection right there well that's all you stuff coming off Wow worried about bouncing everywhere was it we just let this dry a tiny little bit this left little remnants that are in here we'll give it a good whack in about two or three minutes and it'll just fall and cover this look at what beautiful coverage we got with that sieve and in the Sun it looks so nice doesn't it job oh yeah it does some nice close-ups here I'll give it back to you there my friend oh dude beautiful right there cuz you already there beautiful beautiful job today is the birthday boy I know it's my birthday I should answer the phone it's birthday everybody's calling him he's making hash if that's what he alright that's awesome all right we'll be back in a second all right that didn't that 90 look unbelievable aren't you glad we received that right away I'm telling you right now if that 73 was still sitting there it'd be a done deal the 120 we could do any time as well but we'll pull these three bags and we'll do them all together we'll be quick though because the 73 is gonna be just much like that it's gonna be creamy deliciousness that 90 bag just made it all yeah right there and the 73 is doing it too just so you know just so you know it's also doing it yeah all right yeah the 73 is looking creamy too a very creamy I can I could smell it all right let's get that in there Oh thought I was gonna pull the Ricky ledee I thought you're almost gonna pull a rookie moves you know we do that even being we do we do we do I mean that's the that's one of the main reasons I don't mess around with chemical solvents but the fact that they're just come on look at this in the Sun look at the color of that that's just amazing you know what that's you know I can see it I wish you guys will bring it to them we're gonna be like this is one from here directly in this I'll let you pull that little chunk out in a second once I get it right there that guy and I think he didn't have a bit of an animal in that there we go a couple more perfect so stinky yeah this is gonna have to go all right want to get the spoon spoons right here oh yeah this is just like that night he was just like that it even wants this just stay on this that last little bit dang keep it the you know what it's almost the same amount with 73 is there it looks beautiful it's even like hardening on the spoon here screen the next screen is coming up the next screen the next screen I should not be the next parchment the next cardboard and parchment we're hitting gabs it's easy for us too alright so take that guy right here we can rinse this guy off ASAP because he's already starting to dry and that's one thing we talked about is don't let your screen one of the things they were doing in Spain that I couldn't wrap my head around that I really was thinking that it's just something they shouldn't be doing and I saw more than one person do it they pulled all their bags out and then they hung them and lean them up against one another put them in a bag and high-quality resin is gonna wick moisture just sitting on top of that screen so much then it'll be very difficult to see if micro planing will be one of your only options at that point and you'll have to of course freeze the resin before you do that because it's a warm environment in Spain especially in Barcelona even it's hard to get to a cool temperature that you can actually you know even just playing some some hash without having it just start melting your fingers all right it's richer bags very very devil there the better yeah no it's good so we're just given the resin and ice the resin is so clean Beth Lee Mort I see you yeah it's like four grams at least I'd say we've got our 10 to 12 grams anyway Joseph just from the like two and a half to the two to three two three four five six yeah we've got about ten anyway we still haven't pulled 225 either though just give this a couple of good squirts to show if there's any contaminants in there no it's beautiful then we'll scoop it all up how's that for not a drop drive would you like that that's cute dude that's a nice pile that's a huge problem that's not even done yet that's thanks thank five times of everything I'd say it's at least five times of everything yeah I think there's about six grams just there that's definitely close to five maybe 456 you know I'm just guesstimating just like you and I'm like you know no no more accurate and my guess we're gonna weigh it and we'll find out what its gonna be like yeah we're definitely let you know I'd say we're gonna get that through the plane real soon if you want to start sieving yeah why don't you come over here and see why like bags all do the cleaning on this bag I'm gonna grab this 73 right off the hop sure man yeah get that going right away it's good looks good hey you blow that off nice and fast tech I can just do that nice work though well easy going easy going so yeah this is a nice easy way to clean bags isn't it yeah isn't that nice haha totally digging it all right excellent excellent so remember the cleaner you you get your bags the better it's you get that resin stuck on there and you're the one that's gonna be dealing with it that is the truth of that never a bad idea to just use a little extra couple extra minutes and make sure you get it real dry well that's looking great John that's the 73 73 all right you could probably afford to card just a small section of this over there real quick you might even be able to do it just with the lightness I wouldn't touch it with your hands but and then we can put the 120 right here I will draw a line and then we've got two more in there that we'll have to make i'd say we're gonna need at least a whole one easy-easy for that 45 right now yeah then I'll pull the 25 bag this is a bag that everyone has a real problem with a simple technique you can see that it's holding at least 3 gallons of water but a simple technique is to lift it very quickly and the water just releases so a bag like this generally when I start doing this little jerk upwards method I can drain it in about 10 seconds fresh frozen John but I still have more that's sitting to be run again like we'll put it in the bubble now again and run another batch so I'm going to grab that we're not going to film our second batch but we will let you know what came of it that will do many push maybe a little couple days down the road notice how I filled the bag with air and slid my hand down the bag to actually get some of that excess water out do not physically grab the hash in the screen and squeeze it that is not a good idea it's just something that definitely is not a good idea and then finally here we've got our 25 oh yeah looking good John the 120 looked beautiful the 25 is one of the unique resins that you can actually gather with a spoon almost as well as you gather with the spray bottle but why that is if it's the size of the heads obviously it is it's the only thing that's really different about it just clean it so well 25 micron the grade that will pay for your bags whether you want to use it in a metal bowl or an ax joint or smoke it in a bone I saw Franco from strain hunters recently going off on you about USF's 25 micron bubble so you know that there's something to it there's some actives in there depending on where it was growing on the strain this color of this 25 is absolutely beautiful yeah awesome I got water spraying in my face this is awesome it's beautiful look at the Sun just just goodness this is totally beautiful totally awesome birthday thanks for coming over John oh you know what I mean you always come over but put a nice guy to bring the fresh frozen and hey plan this like this is a day it was something that I you know it's I'm gonna I'm gonna give me this cut I've rushed this home now about Christmas I brought him here from my friend Ron's yeah we were laughing about it today it came home in my pocket in a plastic bag and I'm gonna go get the second parchment paper so we can get on seething that 25 and that 45 I'll be right back and what I'm gonna do here as we know this side here is the ones one and this side here is the 73 so instead of drawing a line on the paper here I'm just gonna write it on the cardboard gives me an idea I put the 73 and the 9v fills up that whole tray and this 45 is definitely looking so sweet so I'm gonna wait for mark to come out here right now move this whole dollar bags we've seen the 90 the 120 the 73 and what we have left is the 45 and the 25 we're not bothering with the 222 190th 160 it's just schwag Isles I'm gonna pour this water into my garden down below that's terpene rich hey here we go that right there is what we call koala tay 445 I'm gonna smile on your face look at me dude you're 45 below is that Johnny already five is this your 45 over that's the 45 Oh John do you think that III think it's just a beautiful thing what are you my friend it's for you I'll look at that for you I think I think I think listen maybe just a little bit tiny little bit if it's no good you let me know if we need to we'll add a tiny little bit of moisture it could be perfect it could be perfect oh yeah it's coming through nice it's sticking so gently give it a gentle little smack on the edge as you move it as you yeah oh yeah that's perfect John oh this smells amazing it looks unreal II hear ya believe how the smell this is the colour is written this is probably the nicest 45 I've ever seen it's definitely very nice for me that what I've grown so I mean here and there you can also do a light scraping on the outside make sure you move it when you do that or you'll get clumps though move the whole unit around even towards some of the empty spots so this is a real important process the sieving or the micro planing we're doing the sieving technique it's good to keep your tools cool we're doing this in the sunlight so you guys can see it really well obviously it's a better idea to do this in a colder environment not that it's SuperDuper warm right now but it's definitely probably ten degrees well we are so filler up nice little pile right off another piece and just kind of working yeah gently sieve it through the screens you know there did this did have a little bit more moisture removed even though it's sieving perfectly if I left a little bit more moisture in it it would have probably sieve even a little bit more perfect both the to the 90 and the 73 were like that as well but this looks great you're gonna get it all the way through and you'll be able to to cover this parchment paper nice and evenly so wherever you see it to be the least amount is where you kind of want to spend some attention whoo nice yeah I like that I moved the paper open just as you did it all right I was like team I was like team work you're like very receptive to the motions John hi you know what we work well together we do get the job because we're just having a good time but now it's cuz we love what we do we do love what we do and we seem to be very much alike in our in our just in our histories and the vision involved with and we just seem so damn happy to share with the people out there you know what what's what's the best thing you can do is show people this yeah baby it's my birthday hash look look at the bottom of this I'm so excited oh yeah let's look at the bottom of that in the sunlight alright give it a gentle smack rather than brush it with the spoon you can smack all most of that off sometimes I go high like on this on the top part that's good and then of course some more loosening of it up as it dries as we're taking time that bubble will dry out a little bit more and it'll even break off easier sometimes the little bits that get stuck on the outside you can gently brush it off with a spoon or you could use a brush you could also use one of the anti-static brushes to get this bubble off and that's just a nice even amount we'll give that a few more good whacks on the edge of the stainless steel strainer with the spoon real good ones give it a top whack like a nice hard one yeah that's where you see it really start see how I see it bouncing and releasing them yeah excellent beautiful alright well we've got our 45 we're gonna move on to the 25 so we ran out of space on our parchment paper we don't really want to rip out another batch and the 25 micron of all the hashes if you get it into a thin enough patty it seems to be the one that can actually dry in a patty so we're gonna do a little experiment just with the 25 we're gonna leave this little patty as is and we're still gonna get it on to the wicking table here we've got a nice little spot in the corner of our 45 we'll put it on the parchment there and we'll get back to you and let you know how that kind of turned out it's been an unbelievable birthday batch with my amigo Johnny I mean such a good friend comes over with the beautiful mess whips off a batch with me and this in this beautiful area that we live and yeah I mean basically the only thing really left to share which I'll end with is the macro photographs of the resin that we just made you know starting with that 120 micron beautiful heady heads all stuck together in little clumps beautiful color dropping down into the 90 and suddenly it's like whoa that stuff is surreal Dimond like glistening amazingness with the 73 looking almost exactly like the 90 to the naked eye I expect that it'll look pretty beautiful under the macro lens and then down into the 45 and I'll shoot the patty 25 and we'll share all this greatness with you guys so once again Jon thanks for coming out such a [ __ ] pleasure dude always a pleasure hanging with you bro I'm excited you know what dude I'm excited too this was this was a great day and a great birthday so thanks everyone for watching we'll talk to you soon on bubble man's world peace those are my bird friends they're saying John bubble man share that 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 micron we will peace [Music] you", "cqa2Vtt6gP8": "you're smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] hey what's up tgc it's Scottie real hanging out with love for the plant what's up brother hey how's it going it's going really good man it's going really good and we were hanging out love for the plants friends with frosty McNuggets they came up a couple of weeks ago they gave us a little schooling on some solvent lists actually that was just last week wasn't it was last week lizard compliance man time flies when you're having fun man but frosty talked about a solvent hash last time or solvent extracts I should say man I'm dating myself man and I wouldn't love for the plant to talk about solvent lesser or basically what a solvent less water hashes out we're talking yes yes water hash bubble hash is just a form of solvent list okay so and that's what I would you know I'll be focusing on today we could talk for an hour on each kind of solvent list show me that high end you brought a couple high end yeah hashes right you brought like what's it called the six star water hash that I like to make fun of right yep otherwise known as full melt yeah and gooey you can put up a picture of this for us man yeah check it out it's uh it's totally it's like a white powder it's strange Oh I mean and it really it breaks down to being just try cap heads that's what it is just try cokeheads okay so I know that when you're doing your wood dry sift and everything like that you're trying to sift the broken heads from the whole ones and all that right same concept when you're doing water extraction pretty much for the most part yeah except you will come out with if done properly you will come out with a cleaner product been dry shift okay so we were talking before and I remember I went god I think they had like a six bag system bubble bags yeah I don't know if they still make a just bubble bag still a brand man oh yeah yeah they're uh onion brands in fact he has a couple of different tiers of them now excellent yeah they used to have like a three bag system which for somebody like me I was just glad to make something I could smoke out of my [ __ ] leaves trim yeah like right now they have four bag by bag eight bag you know depending on one's needs right will dictate which one you want do you buy them off with calm men no kind of break that down yeah when we're talking about like a 5 or 8 bag system it's having different micron screens so you can have the different grades of trichome heads or treasure talks or just separating your plant material it lets you have different grades of hash and then condoms it's now in it from there do you need six different grades of hash is that how it works so I'll give an example you know just to follow up on what guru said like these bags right here I have a five bag set right not optimal because I go from 120 micron to 73 micron okay there's no ninety in between so qualities are for some cultivars 90 maybe that sweet spot oh wow does a the type of the cultivar the type of cannabis that you're straining makes a difference on the size of the trichome absolutely Oh that'd probably determine yeah in fact even in fact different cultivars even have different shapes of trichome heads Wow and that makes sense why some guys are telling us they're getting crazy big yields off of off of these strains oh yeah the cultivars oh yes there's a huge difference in yield from one cultivar to the next we we've seen yields of over over twenty percent right for like a three ninety eight bubble or there are some others that yield really well and actually so I'll name a few like really girly for obviously that's one that would doesn't surprise them any people that are really well yeah but I'm sour Kush banana Kush those are some little some less known ones that that yield really well really yeah I actually have some Atticus yeah yeah there you go I mean I would put an emphasis on if you're going to watch something lost one that you know I tell you it will produce well in fact we brought we try to bring in like some old or not a little bit like some trendy strains right whenever I was working it at that facility well I'll get into a little bit later when we brought in those Jayne's we were only getting a yield of like three to five percent when we're used to getting like 18 to 22 percent and we did everything the same so that's how much it matters and that's why you often hear some people talk about well I tried bubble has in this case you're sure they may actually be good at making bubble hash and just had the your own cultivar the whole time you know he's they'd be good at making bubble hash it definitely is an art I used to make it I was doing it said I was just psyched to get something smokeable my friend or my hell without one of my growing partners was an artist like a true you know to paint and draw and everything like that we would leave him alone for the night with a six-pack of Budweiser and and a wooden spoon and that's all he would use man but he would grieve would just make the best [ __ ] hash I mean it was like dabble hash in the 90s you know what I'm saying is amazing The Devil's in the details is what you're telling me right yeah absolutely all right so you're gonna hook us up with little details moons are absolutely so all right cool yeah I mean first off just what interrupts I'm sorry if I'm going on Amazon or I'm going online with the [ __ ] do I buy what do I need well so you'll see a wide range in price on the bags right and I that was a mystery that you know I'd always wondered what the real differences between the different qualities of bags different levels of bags right I actually asked one of the more reputable actually the person I respect the most he was probably going through 100 different bags and I was like so tell me break this down for me what what do you what do you not get with the cheaper bags like from you know like a cheap Amazon this is like a bubble man bag yep and he said the screens are pretty comparable actually maybe a slight difference right but what you but what you're going to get with your cheaper bags are little pieces of thread that come off and it gets into your hash and it was funny because that's a big deal yeah so I made something home actually this is one of those cheaper set right and you know I you couldn't see the threads until you put it up in a microscope and you know you're looking at trichome heads if you make really nice bubbly eyes your eyes you're looking at it very closely and we started noticing little bitty tiny like red threads and [ __ ] and when you go for what Bo what who's the bubble man bags right yeah yeah bubble man is okay I'm is what you know that's like you know calling his bags out because that's one of the people I learned from that's what I was gonna say shout-out to that guy because he put so much education out there yup yup that's exactly I'll be back in the old school I mean it's yeah I was watching his videos and Prohibition land just couldn't wait I remember I was in Canada and I saw bubble banks for the first time and I was on vacation with my wife and my girlfriend back then I think I had 200 bucks left on vacation there were $285 I was like empty your wallet I need trust me this'll work but I was so excited to bring those things back for me it was like letting the gold cuz I couldn't figure out what to do with all my trim and 20 lights a trim that's a garbage bag of trim right yeah these were amazing alright so we got the brands now as far as four or five eight you know what do we buy if I'm just its that matter how much of a kind of sir I'm trying to be yeah absolutely okay if you're you know if you're just making bubble hash for Bowl toppers or yep or if you're just going to press it you know if even if you want to press it out into a rosin which we'll get into a little bit later right yeah I mean you can get by with a lot of things it's just a matter of you know as I go through the different things it's just a matter of maybe a 5% difference you know you can still get top-shelf bubble hash by not doing some of these things or you know maybe not having a the best bag system but you're just talking about incremental gains with some of the things we'll be talking about so deal deal all right so it well first off I'm intrigued man big plants big trikes yeah I mean definitely it's the you know when I worked for the oh well just go ahead and say so you know I I have a lot of experience just making bubble hash at home watching all you know watched all the videos read all the forums a lot of trial and error right but shortly thereafter I started working at one of well at the time was the most reputable saw solvent list company and the state of Colorado so yeah you know I kind of took my personal experience in that professional experience right and came up with just a list of tips and tricks you know that I just learned over time and a lot of these tips and tricks you would you won't find in summation all of them and in like a single video how-to video yeah that would be hard-pressed to find you know everything all at once these are these are tips and tricks that I've picked up over time sure they're probably I know there are others that I won't even talk about um but I kind of view these tips and tricks' is like the magic that happens between the main steps okay I'm making about will hash like if you got watch a video on how to make bubble hash right they'll give you those basic steps and you better know those basic steps very well right but there's some magic that happens in between there yeah I mean and there's ways you can screw it up - yeah I beat the hell out of the out of the material before man so yeah so I will get into it man yeah let's get into some of the specifics if we could yeah so take me through the process we got our Bowl bag showed up from bubble man from here you PS man got them what else do I need well first of all you want to work in a cooler environment I prefer like 50 degrees obviously you wouldn't want to work in the freezer we can wrap things are going to start freezing up sure but yeah in in Colorado we're we have very cool weather most of the time so I'm probably just working outside that that's very convenient okay so cool degrees so fun if I'm in Florida or from something you know my buddies in Florida or something like that can you work inside a refrigerator or something do you have yeah think about that no I do not man but that sounds like a decent night yeah okay sounds like something wacky that I would tell my I need to do yeah I need you to work inside the refrigerator okay man yeah trust me it's gonna be dank yeah all right so so we can work outside 50 degree temperatures something like that what do we do with the material now and and what do we mean anything I know you got a couple tricks up your sleeve well the first thing is you know optimally you want to use reverse osmosis water but we all know they draw back first of all RRL water is costly and but and it's also taxing on the environment so you can make a judgment call and whether you want to do that or not but just know that that's what the the top shelf past that you're seeing out on the market right now they're using RL water is that different than distilled water as far as a guru it should be clean right you're just trying to get clean water right in water yeah without minerals in it right with the no minerals in it distills not gonna have that or not gonna have much of that at all okay cool but clean water yeah all right next step what do we do man so you'll just well you harvest your plant yep so we I'm dry it what the [ __ ] is a freeze dryer man why does guru want a freeze dryer do we need one so as we go through this the bubble hash making right the very end the final step well I guess the final step of the bubble hash right would be to put it in there freeze okay sound and you know everyone's talking about that right now because it's a huge investment yeah but okay so we don't need so all we do is we dry our plant normally do we need to cure the plant so so there yes you can do cured flower most of the top shelf bubble hash or rosin that's being made out on the market right now is actually being done with fresh frozen material and that's where most of my experiences fresh frozen so we're trying the work we're not drying the trap so chop the plant you know you can let it set sit for up to two hours people have different opinions on that I like letting some of the moisture out of it right Wow tourette yeah and then put it in the freezer right let it freeze for at least 24 hours yeah and then that's when you can start the extraction process with making bubble hash and now we're not we're not breaking it up or anything we're not using a grinder you don't want to grind it too much but you also don't want too big of colas in there so we are using a grinder no it's just more of a it's just more of a manual manual cut smaller budge honest yeah okay fair enough man all right so come on give me some tips man so how long we soak in this for okay so let's get to get yeah I want the DVC to be at least Bank right off the bat yeah you know yeah so one of the little tips that you know I see out there some whenever I'm just searching around but not everyone and some people have heard it but then they forget it right is too when you put your frozen material into the washer we'll get into washers too but you put your material into the washer you let it soak for 15 minutes okay and that's going to allow your plant material to softened a little bit so it won't become brittle right now you're saying washer hang on a second yeah you're talking about the little bubble later machines man those things are cool I thought I was just being lazy yeah but they came out with them I don't think they're under they used to be under 200 bucks anyhow they're not expensive I thought they were a Chinese washing machines is what I thought they were like for a little tiny apartment to watch like one piece of clothing at a time I don't know anyway their coolest [ __ ] man those things ooh so that's what I call that a bubble later what do they call those things yeah I know there are different names sure but yeah I mean so many people at home will just manually sure maybe with a wooden spoon that works really great especially if you have the really smooth you know really smooth motion and do everything right all right but most of my experience has been using the washer sure and we've done a B test at the at the process at the company that worked out right and it the washer just yields is so much better and it's really the labor - okay I mean it's like start stirring it it's fun at first it's like trimming at first it's hot and then it gets old pretty cool yeah a lot and you could run two or three of those washers man I've went through those washes yeah they were great I mean all the top shelf bubble hash that's coming out they don't have workers in there stirring this no no I'm sure it exists but washers I agree with you man okay so I was just so we got a 15-minute soak yep thirty minutes oh and then we're throwing in in the machine we're turning on the recess for how long how long we running them actually so before we turn on the machine I want to point out that during that so before or after that so good I've seen it done both ways you can actually and what I'm about to say is fairly controversial among solvent less people okay because the moment you say dry ice people want to run because they think in the particulate in the end product right about using it to keep the water cold absolutely right so you you have your you have your 220 micron bag with your fresh frozen material in there right your ice water what you can do is just kind of pepper pepper some small pieces of dry ice and around the outside of the bag okay so we've got an ice water I forgot to explain that we though you've got to fill this bubble later machine yeah I've got to fill it with water with a bunch of ice you know whole trick to do it cold absolutely yep and then you just drop some dry ice in there and you know that what the dry ice does is it'll just take the temperature you know we had one of those infrared and thermometers take the temperature from like maybe 33 34 to to like 31 and since it's always moving it's not freezing so sure you can get it down 30 31 and that matters just getting it down a few more degrees helps in quality absolutely yeah really yeah and since you soak the material you're not going to get much particulate come through and what and what little comes through your catch dude you are [ __ ] detailed now looking at some of your some of your tips here yeah and he says frozen utensils so you're keeping the spoon that you're starting your ass so most people I don't have a sorry about that what you got hook it up you know most people's going to use a spoon similar to this right the easiest tip in the world is just to keep keep it frozen man like you're touching those you're trying to keep everything as cold as possible so you just keep this in the freezer so I'm curious you're and you're like independent research I know you guys have been playing with solvus do you keep your utensils frozen I mean it would makes having thoughts to do that okay see if it definitely makes sense to do that just because you're you're trying to you spent so much time keeping everything riding around 30 degrees then why would you want to touch it with something that's like 50 days in the process yeah so hey so okay so one of your other tips I mean these are kind of sir tips here man they got you really get the ball you know you get like a 2% game from them yeah and you're saying game from that before you know you have like a 10% better product you know I remember my buddy was in the racecars and he was talking about that he was like oh yeah like after 1/2 percent performance increase from that I'm like what a [ __ ] you spend $2,000 on a half percent or whatever but in this case man for if it cost you nothing to freeze the spooning you get a little bit little nudge here in the edge there oh that's how you get that six star man absolutely yeah anyway so one of the other tricks that I never used to do we I used to just take the the sink sprayer spray some water on the sides because what happens when it when the bubbly the bubble air these things bubble up well they used to say if it doesn't bubble it ain't worth the trouble right so it bubbles up and you'll get all sorts of collection.you bubbles all over the side there man so I would spray him with little sink hose but that wasn't very cold water yes what a lot of people are doing now is you get like a pump sprayer like you said like that metal guru would you throw a picture of this metal Chapin sprayer up man it's cool as hell yeah these are always available I would say just use it you can use these things for spraying other things but just use this one for spraying plain water yeah and this is really for kind of spraying and doing like a secondary wash on your homepage you have there to try and like spray through any trichome stalks or anything that might be left over and kind of clean up the trichome heads that are left in there I just thought really cool keeping stuff from sticking to the sides man yeah I know yep and another little tip is don't just use water use ice water all right lady go not throw some ice into that sprayer sure so okay so and now so what do you stack those bags on top of each other yeah yeah you know the the highest micron bag in my case is 220 would be on top right and then you just go down to these smaller bags now the 220 show that one because that's the different bag the 220 is the one that holds all of all the material there's a 220 so actually I'm glad you brought that up so the bag that goes inside the washer two-twenty bag right so that bag is just like you zip it up you know that's Rosa material in it's just a really simple bag that's just nothing but a big screen it's almost like the size of a screen 220 microns is big if the idea is to let it just to let everything wash through there without letting a bunch of plant material go through yep so then you do a second 220 after that again just to make sure that nothing leaked out you know that 220 mine has like a crappy zipper on it so yeah okay so you'll be in the later steps to to go ahead and get some of any any plant matter out yes what we're trying to do there okay so that's our that's our first one now what do we got after that so you know once once you go all the way down you know get you so each bag will have its own collection sure right and you know that's where that sprayer comes into play and then you scoop it out is that yeah yeah yeah how do you prepare that I mean I've done the horrible thing I've actually been like how [ __ ] I want to smoke I squeezed it yeah what do you do and then I've just let it dry before and it comes to kind of comes out is that really kind of strange how do you prepare it you'll scoop it out I mean it's I don't really know what to compare the consistence mud yeah it's a really since we have freeze dryers now you you don't have to get as much moisture out of it as you used to okay back in the day people would put screens on it and like press it with the paper yeah but you're smashing your tractor that's what I always felt like I was doing something wrong but I'm alright yeah so but now you know we can just scoop it out and almost just a very liquid form and just spread it out and then the freeze dryer will we'll pull all the moisture out all right have we gotten to the freeze-dried stage at this point man now is a good time you're talking about right why does guru when a freeze dryer so bad man it's all about turf preservation man yeah every year spending so much time and energy keeping everything cold through this whole process right that why would you want to ruin it ruin it and drying it and not lock in all those terpenes that you've spent so much time to save and collect and the freeze dryer lets you do that because it's just gonna pull out all the water or a frozen temperature so that you I mean so a freeze dryer is basically I dehumidifier inside of a freezer pretty much yeah it's a really simple way of putting it there I mean like the starting just a small at-home one is like three thousand that's what I was gonna say a three thousand dollar these middle fire inside of a freezer mm-hmm that's a hell of an investigator no because goober and frosty are going to create a do-it-yourself I heard something about this man I heard something about this geeking out here I heard the last time they defrost he was here just tell guru not to buy a freeze dryer yeah I talked to him I loved it man alright so as far as the preparations go when we're done what can what can we make out you absolutely yeah so once it comes out of the freeze dryer right so what just get a friend with a freeze dryer find a rich friend and tell him how easy it is to do this [ __ ] yes and let me know when you find there that's why I don't make much myself hey sure freeze-dried lots of other stuff too you don't have to just freeze dry half that's what I've been telling myself lately please try anything in half like food that's good for 20 years just add water so without a freeze dryer we can make basically a basic bubble hash right right so without a freeze dryer you're you are letting it air dry but even with the air dry you're going to have moisture kind of stuck in between those trichome heads that are all in you know I've got a chest yeah so so you know because that moisture is there it almost creates a consistency that you really can't break up those trichomes very well so you know the most common method is the micro planing anyone who's done bubble hashes you're probably done this or at least seen it done on videos yeah just spreading a really clear out so yeah driver you so that freeze dryer not only does it preserve Terps it saves a hell of a lot on labor because there is no micro planing with that I mean you said if you pull it out of the freeze dryer and it just pretty much breaks apart it's right incredible okay so we're getting to the freeze-dried I heard they have easy payment plans gurus have a Facebook targeted you as well yeah you get that in a rosin press from okay oh yeah okay so there's nothing I don't have a freeze dryer can I just take the my bubble hash and press it yeah absolutely so I'm trying to think yes people aren't gonna have access to a freeze dryer I can get I can't wait to get into what we can make if we get our buddy to spend twenty five miles but let's uh so what can we do for five hundred dollar rosin press what can we do with that okay so you can take that bubble hash right and put it in like a thirty six micron screen you can you can do you can do like a 72 micron screen as well cool the place that I work they actually use like a metal it was like a big sheet just huge industrial sheet they just cut pieces off of it okay I really like that metal versus the nylon so yeah you put it in just a really low micron screen right and press it at you know 151 155 and so this is it in terms of like the temperatures with a lot of people press Ross a net this is a pretty cold or low temp press yeah yeah one that's even at 155 just to put it in in perspective sure like I press flower at 185 to 210 you know depending on like quality okay so real so it is that cuz it's the water in it is that what you're doing it for I think it's just because it works better if you don't even mortar P and preservation right okay it's just not pressing at a high temperature just to avoid volatilizing off any of those terpenes that fall into like that temperature range makes sense to me man makes sense to me all right now guess what I got good news brother so I just found somebody with a freeze dryer man oh yeah I roll a brother man yeah oh yeah now what can we make man okay so you know from that point that's where some of the latest product that's on the market with the end product I mean it almost looks like butane extracted live resonator P early in a lot of its will even call it live rosin do we have anything this show see I'm sure I'm sure we can figure something out was all nice okay so there are some techniques in Vault so once you create your rosin you know you press you press that bubble hash out you have this rosin there are some post extraction techniques that even I don't know because I've been out of the game for over a year sure so there have been some new shogi right it's moving fast man yeah so yeah I can't keep up sure and there are some things I don't know yeah I've seen just bits and pieces I know some people are taking the rosin putting it on like 90 degrees I've seen different things but I can't definitively say this is what you do to create I've even seen stuff where people have gotten acid recrystallization solvent Leslie absolutely with rosin that has enough terpenes in it today I was the acid in that reaction where you really get like like diamonds and sauce right but solvent list diamonds and sauce somebody has been reading cannabis anca me I'm telling you man they were there there was like a formula for this in the 70s man there was AD gold made this book cannabis alchemy that was just the most they talked about what the heck was that man recrystallization I remember he had verses acetates he would make man and I was like I remember that [ __ ] that once I bought the gallon of ether I was out man yeah if anyone out if anyone in the DDC knows more about this ok let's talk about it let's start a discussion because it's immunity I think that's one of the benefits of having the DVC you know we can we can share some really good knowledge you know there there are those of us who worked in the industry at times and there are also people who just geeked out at home and focus nothing on nothing but cannabis and the man's an artist yeah yeah we need to pull that knowledge together so some of this post extraction process right if anyone knows a lot about it I know a couple people you know I know a couple of DGC members that do a lot of solvent list extraction and I bet they know quite a bit so let's start it hell yeah but it teach me something man first off is this real are you kidding me man I know what sauce is I know that that exists man sausage I get a little terpene yeah so so what just like with live resin each dispensary is creating a you know trying to create their own brain sir and they're calling a different things you know I see it called Jam sauce like solvent less sauce right you know you have to be like 17 labs here in Denver they're calling there's like a rosin Jam right isn't that what they're calling it yeah I would go to that oh yeah I mean dude so the stuff coming out of 17 labs it's just ridiculous and part of that Falls just to where their garden I mean it's a fear of quality and quality I can get some of these like six-star water hashes in full melt has less you have your garden dialed in to begin with yeah makes it makes so it again I just want to get back to this if I pull my [ __ ] out of the freeze dryer well how can I make what do I mean I can make any of these things I can make sauce I can make jam or you can take that you can take just what comes out of the the freeze dried right you know that we call that you know six star hash is what we've talked about a lot sure it's also just called full melt okay you can you can just drop that full melt right on your dab you know right on your nail and dab it that way and there shouldn't be any right I'm about to do that you know what some of that white stuff yeah me too okay so if I don't want to walk around white powder then man what can I do with it man that gets into the post extraction processing that some of those techniques okay and of course you know I'm talking about after you press it out sure yeah there are many things you can do from there to create different consistencies interesting man interesting all right man I learned something you know I get high yeah you're not a smoke man Stewart let's check out some of these goods survey this is really good appreciate the hell out of it yeah look where you're headed thanks brother yeah look for the plant check them out yeah [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh [Music] today
