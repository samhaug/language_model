{"ey_EjSzKFWQ": "Hey guys! I'm the Hacksmith and on the\u00a0\nlast episode of make it real we made the\u00a0\u00a0 world's first retractable plasma based lightsaber. That looks like a lightsaber and at\u00a0\ntemperatures of over 4,000 Fahrenheit\u00a0\u00a0 it's almost as hot as one two but the real\u00a0\nquestion is does it work like a lightsaber? Now obviously a lightsaber needs to\u00a0\nbe good at stabbing stormtroopers. Now besides ruthlessly murdering stormtroopers\u00a0\u00a0 a lightsaber should also be\u00a0\nable to cut through walls. Alright so that wasn't really a\u00a0\nreal wall. What about metal siding? How about a steel door? Can you cut through that? Alright now you may have noticed we actually do\u00a0\u00a0 have a big tank of oxygen and propane\u00a0\nthat Bogdan's currently hooked up to. The only reason we're doing that is\u00a0\nbecause these tests take a while. The backpack does work by itself but these\u00a0\nsmall tanks only last for about five minutes\u00a0\u00a0 when we're filming a big test video like this\u00a0\nit's important to have a lot of extra gas. Which is why we're going with\u00a0\nthe corded route at the moment. A lightsaber's got to be able to cut through\u00a0\na blaster let's see if we can do that. We know lightsabers can cut off limbs\u00a0\nwhat would our lightsaber do to flesh? Let's find out. Jedi scum. Delicious. Time for the ultimate test. Lightsaber versus lightsaber. Oh no oh no! My lights- The light's still on. The\u00a0\nlight's still on the lightsaber! We're actually gonna be giving away this Mace\u00a0\nWindu lightsaber cut with the world's first\u00a0\u00a0 real-life plasma lightsaber along\u00a0\nwith a whole bunch of Hacksmith swag\u00a0\u00a0 thanks to our sponsor Honey.

I can't let Bogdan have all the fun I think\u00a0\nit's my turn to test out this lightsaber. Now a few years ago the internet was\u00a0\na buzz with the question what would\u00a0\u00a0 happen if you took a lightsaber\u00a0\nto Captain America's shield? Well I think we are some of the only\u00a0\npeople in the world qualified to find out. Let's see! As you can see it melts vibranium like butter! Let's try some everyday objects I\u00a0\nwonder what happens if I hit a window? That is freaking cool. Oh it's melting! and exploding! You can literally see it's molten! It's molten! It's dripping out the other side! That was freaking awesome. Alright window panes is one thing\u00a0\nbut what about tempered glass? I'm kind of expecting this to\u00a0\nshatter as well but maybe it'll melt. Oh it's kind of scary. Holy moly! Oh that was awesome! Alright so we've tried glass but\u00a0\nwhat if we turn sand into glass? Wow! Oh it's working already! It's also blowing the sand in the\u00a0\nair but a bunch of it's melting. There's a glob. Combine! Look at that! I'd like to introduce you to my\u00a0\ngood friend Ivan from ZombieGoBoom\u00a0\u00a0 he generously donated his body for science. Waaaa! Oh boy! Uh-oh Uuuh so hot. Let's see what happens to concrete. Whoa oh ow that's burning. Look at that! Look it's still glowing! Now I don't really want to stand here forever\u00a0\nmelting this hole but I think it would work. What's next? Off with their head! Alright time for the ultimate test! I'm going to try cutting through\u00a0\u00a0 a quarter inch steel plate to represent a\u00a0\nblast shield door just like Qui-Gon Jin. It's like making little\u00a0\nrainbows as the heat spreads. We are through quarter inch steel plate! I can't believe we went through a blast\u00a0\nshield door quarter inch steel plate. That's crazy! Now based on the size of your turkey you're\u00a0\ngoing to want to cook it at 4,000 degrees\u00a0\u00a0 for 5 seconds per pound of turkey. Oh yeah. Perfect! Now since it is thanksgiving here in\u00a0\nCanada and not everyone is fortunate\u00a0\u00a0 enough to be able to lightsaber their\u00a0\nown turkey for thanksgiving dinner. We've actually donated $500 in honor of our\u00a0\u00a0 lightsaber turkey to the\u00a0\nWaterloo region food bank. James loves destroying vehicles. He's destroyed a Civic, an Impala, and a Sunfire\u00a0\nso i got him this beauty a Buick Riviera. Another car! Let's see what we can do to a car. Oh is it melting? It's melting! Oh the inside of the car is\u00a0\non fire from the molten glass! Yeah let's see what happens to the door? Wow holy! Oh here we go! Whoa that was cool! Whoa! Let's do the classic Jedi cutting\u00a0\nthrough the tie fighter roof. Except my tie fighter is a Buick Riviera Look at that perfect hole! Yeah the lightsaber did quite a bit of damage... What would you guys destroy with the lightsaber? Let us know in the comments below.

first\u00a0\nretractable plasma-based lightsaber Big thank you to our YouTube members and\u00a0\nPatreon supporters for supporting the\u00a0\u00a0 channel they get tons of perks including\u00a0\nseeing our videos before anyone else\u00a0\u00a0 like the lightsaber test video which is\u00a0\navailable on our channel right now for members A real retractable plasma based lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 the pinnacle of sci-fi tech and probably one of\u00a0\nthe most sought after fictional technologies ever As you know we've been developing different\u00a0\nlightsabers or like they're called in star\u00a0\u00a0 wars lore proto-sabers for the past four years now From some initial power supply tests\u00a0\nthat got the fire department called on us\u00a0\u00a0 to version one using nitinol wire to version two\u00a0\nusing a tungsten titanium blade hybrid version\u00a0\u00a0 2.1 so we could have a real-life lightsaber\u00a0\nduel which by the way was extremely unsafe To finally our kylo ren style lightsaber\u00a0\ncomplete with a 3d printed titanium hilt A proto-saber of course is a lightsaber with\u00a0\nan external power pack since you know we don't\u00a0\u00a0 exactly have d-sized batteries capable of\u00a0\nputting out more power than a nuclear power\u00a0\u00a0 plant which by the way is what you'd need for a\u00a0\nlightsaber to function like it does in the movies Now in my opinion what we've made so far are some\u00a0\nof the closest representations of lightsabers\u00a0\u00a0 using real life technologies they look like\u00a0\na lightsaber they sound like a lightsaber and at temperatures of over 3000 degrees\u00a0\nthey actually cut stuff like a lightsaber But as you know the internet is not easily pleased\u00a0\u00a0 those are just red hot sticks that's just\u00a0\na red hot piece of metal that's not even\u00a0\u00a0 a real lightsaber your lightsaber\u00a0\nsucks and you should feel bad too Luckily I have thick skin since I've read over\u00a0\nhalf a million comments on my YouTube channel That's equivalent to like 200\u00a0\nfull-length novels by the way So despite the trolls best wishes we have\u00a0\nnot given up which is good since you know\u00a0\u00a0 you could count on one hand the amount of people\u00a0\nin this world actually working on lightsaber tech Anyway how the heck do you make\u00a0\na plasma based lightsaber well\u00a0\u00a0 best theories say that plasma is\u00a0\nheld in a beam by a magnetic field\u00a0\u00a0 which scientifically checks out you see the issue\u00a0\nis producing a strong enough electromagnetic field\u00a0\u00a0 to contain a blade well the lightsaber would\u00a0\nquite literally have to be built inside of a box\u00a0\u00a0 coated in an electromagnets which turns\u00a0\nit into kind of a useless science project I made a lightsaber Luckily we've come up with an alternate\u00a0\nsolution to control the flow of plasma\u00a0\u00a0 which allows us to make a retractable\u00a0\nblade and even change its color We're going to be using laminar flow you know\u00a0\nthat cool thing where liquids flow smoothly We actually teased this project months ago on\u00a0\nour instagram which maybe we shared too soon\u00a0\u00a0 since it's resulted in almost all new\u00a0\ncomments being where is the lightsaber I mean come on guys it might not be\u00a0\nbrain surgery but building a lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 is basically rocket science it's taken\u00a0\nus quite a few months to get just right\u00a0\u00a0 and we also had to upgrade our equipment in\u00a0\nthe shop to even be able to manufacture it\u00a0\u00a0 like our new Tormach 1100 mx cnc\u00a0\nmachine complete with a fourth axis Bogdan's been pretty excited to try it out\u00a0\nand since star wars was a long time ago in\u00a0\u00a0 a galaxy far far away it's only fitting that\u00a0\nour first real plasma lightsaber is steampunk\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's Bogdan's turn to design that hilt Steampunk is a subset of science\u00a0\nfiction which incorporates\u00a0\u00a0 antique design aesthetics from the\u00a0\n19th century with modern technologies When I was scrolling through to get some\u00a0\ndesign inspirations for the lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 I came across this picture and it instantly\u00a0\ncaught my attention i think steampunk would\u00a0\u00a0 be great for this design because we're going\u00a0\nto be using a lot of gauges valves copper\u00a0\u00a0 tubing and regulators which are going\u00a0\nto look perfect in this installation Here's the final design of a lightsaber\u00a0\nhilt it incorporates lots of materials\u00a0\u00a0 including brass copper stainless glass\u00a0\nand even leather to give it that true\u00a0\u00a0 steampunk look I've even decided to\u00a0\nadd the kyber crystal heating chamber\u00a0\u00a0 using some EL wire and a neon bulb to\u00a0\nmake it look really cool in the dark The copper pipes that carry our\u00a0\nflammable gasses are nice and visible\u00a0\u00a0 and the adjustment knobs are easily accessible Thanks to our new Tormach machines\u00a0\nwe are now able to manufacture\u00a0\u00a0 much more intricate designs such\u00a0\nas this one let's Make It Real This video is sponsored by AFK Arena AFK Arena is a light rpg the best rpg for\u00a0\nthe busy you as you know we're always crazy\u00a0\u00a0 busy here at hacksmith industries

hypogean elite heroes Seize the opportunity and download AFK arena\u00a0\ntoday plus it helps support our channel Oh my god that looks incredible\u00a0\nyeah well put some gloves on\u00a0 I'm sorry can't get any smudges on a lightsaber That is incredible I think you've\u00a0\noutdone yourself on this one Bogdan\u00a0 Look at the detail in that if that's\u00a0\nnot steampunk I don't know what is But the real question is, how\u00a0\nare we going to power this? Even with all of our new equipment and\u00a0\ncapabilities here at Hacksmith industries\u00a0\u00a0 we're still kind of bound by the\u00a0\nlaws of thermodynamics which means\u00a0\u00a0 we're still going to have to make this into a\u00a0\nproto saber with a power pack separate from the\u00a0\u00a0 hilt now we've made incredibly energy dense power\u00a0\npacks before but in order to get enough power for\u00a0\u00a0 a plasma based lightsaber we're gonna have to use\u00a0\nsomething with more energy dense fuel in this case\u00a0\u00a0 lpg compressed liquid propane gas which can give\u00a0\nus 50 times more energy per kilogram than a lipo Now that's a pretty incredible difference and the\u00a0\ncool thing you probably have this right at home We're talking about normal propane\u00a0\nthat you use in your barbecue So how do we turn propane into\u00a0\na superheated beam of plasma? The answer lies with one of the most\u00a0\nsatisfying demonstrations of physics phenomena\u00a0\u00a0 of fluids laminar flow basically we need a large\u00a0\narray of laminar flow nozzles to create highly\u00a0\u00a0 concentrated flow of gas to create a plasma\u00a0\nbeam lucky for us we aren't the only ones who\u00a0\u00a0 need this and highly specialized gas nozzles\u00a0\nlike this can be found at a rather high price This nozzle right here costs over four\u00a0\nthousand dollars and it's used in the\u00a0\u00a0 glass blowing industry to achieve maximum\u00a0\ntemperature we need complete combustion\u00a0\u00a0 which means in addition to this propane we're\u00a0\nactually going to be using oxygen as well That doesn't sound dangerous, right? Anyways let's see how it works First turn on the propane, then we\u00a0\nturn on the oxygen, some safety glasses and the sparker So look at that Is that not a lightsaber? This beam is really cool it's actually\u00a0\nburning at around 4 000 fahrenheit\u00a0\u00a0 which means is capable of\u00a0\ncutting through a lot of stuff Should we cut through some stuff? Whoa so this is actually our old\u00a0\nlightsaber blade made of titanium\u00a0\u00a0 and look at that it's already white hot That is so bright, Jesus The really cool thing about doing a flame like\u00a0\nthis is we can actually color it using salts Let's start with some boric acid What color do you think it's\u00a0\ngoing to turn the blade?\u00a0 Got your guesses? Look at that Next up we have calcium chloride Look at that red orange,\u00a0\nthat almost hurts to look at We have some strontium chloride Whoa that is like a road flare,\u00a0\nthis actually hurts to look at Look at that Finally we have some sodium\u00a0\nchloride also known as salt And look at that we've got\u00a0\nRey's lightsaber right here Is that not cool? So we're able to produce a blue lightsaber,\u00a0\na green lightsaber, a red lightsaber,\u00a0\u00a0 an amber lightsaber and even a yellow lightsaber How awesome is that?\nI should probably turn this off though That took a lot of fine tuning to\u00a0\nget the blade to the right length\u00a0\u00a0 and turning it off wasn't the most elegant Luckily Bogdan's going to be actually\u00a0\nmaking a circuit with two fancy valves\u00a0\u00a0 which means we'll actually be able to\u00a0\nget a computer to control the flow of gas\u00a0\u00a0 to allow for this to ignite and\u00a0\nretract with the press of a button So I'm gonna let Bogdan handle that After twelve weeks of anticipation we finally\u00a0\ngot our hands on proportional control valves These will allow us to control exactly\u00a0\nhow much gas goes into the lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 and therefore make it extend and\u00a0\nretract now we just need to figure\u00a0\u00a0 out how to control it and to do that I'll\u00a0\nbe making a custom printed circuit board I'm going to be using Altium designer which is the\u00a0\u00a0 industry standard for PCB design\u00a0\nsoftware and it's super powerful This is the printed circuit board that\u00a0\nCharles designed to use for the Crysis\u00a0\u00a0 arm but since both projects\u00a0\nare using pneumatic valves\u00a0\u00a0 and auxiliary outputs we'll be able to use it\u00a0\nfor our lightsaber with some minor modifications This board looks great if you want to view\u00a0\nthis PCB yourself you can use Altium viewer One of the only machines we don't\u00a0\nhave in the shop is a PCB mill\u00a0\u00a0 but why would we get one of those when\u00a0\nwebsites like JLCPCB will allow us to\u00a0\u00a0 order high quality boards in a matter of\u00a0\ndays for just two dollars for five boards We'd need like 15 000 boards to make\u00a0\nup the cost of one of those machines Let's get these ordered While we wait for that I'm gonna get st- Well that was quick let's start soldering Okay To better understand how the lightsaber\u00a0\nelectronics work check out our page on maker.io We've got to build a steampunk power pack\u00a0\nwith these pieces I'll let Chris handle that Well this all needs to be polished before I can\u00a0\nstart building I'm gonna let Dave handle that No Fine I'll do it myself We did it The world's first retractable\u00a0\nplasma based lightsaber Now obviously we're going to have\u00a0\nan amazing test video for this We've got tons of stuff set up behind\u00a0\nus to really put this through its paces\u00a0\u00a0 including cutting through a steel door Anyways that video is actually available\u00a0\nright now for our Patreon supporters and\u00a0\u00a0 YouTube members which is a great time to support\u00a0\nthe channel and get to see this video early For everyone else it'll be out next week Thanks for watching and make sure you subscribe", "ke_RITY9Unw": "in this video we're going to cover the top seven lightsaber companies that you should know about in 2021 who to buy from whom not to buy from and why hello there welcome this is star wars in real life where we fill our lives with star wars instead of things that actually matter like never buying anything from ultrasabers.com again ever this video is part of a series of videos designed to help star wars fans build their very first lightsaber so if you've ever wanted to build your own lightsaber but you went online and you did a google search on how to build a lightsaber you saw all the work involved and you were like yeah that forever then this video series is going to be for you also consider checking out my new lightsaber academy tier on patreon for more in-depth lightsaber building content now if you don't even have a hilt yet then here are seven lightsaber companies that you should know about right now but first really quick i want to hear from all you guys have you already purchased a lightsaber help before in your life tell us what your experience was like how's the quality what's the customer service like are you happy are you not happy let us all know down in the comments your opinion really matters here let's get started number seven the poc store now even though i'm not a lightsaber channel one of the questions i get asked most on my channel is hey where can i get a good quality cheap lightsaber from and the answer the puck store the poc store sells a dual worthy stunt lightsaber called the shiva for 39 granted that is just a base price if you want the battery it'll cost you 52 and the blade would make it 78 but still that's crazy cheap if you want a lightsaber strong enough to deal with you will not find one cheaper than this they also sell very affordable replica and neopixel lightsabers so if you remember from my previous video you'll know that if you want the brightest lightsaber possible with cool effects like smooth swing then you're gonna need neopixel leds inside of your blade and the pox storer has got you covered and despite being based in hong kong they've got pretty quick shipping times i think it's like one to two weeks to prepare your order in another two weeks to ship it from hong kong to like the us which is unheard of in the lightsaber industry way faster than say like save your forge or ultra sabers and speaking of which let's talk about a company that should not be on your shopping list ever ultra savers if you've ever shopped online for lightsabers then you probably know about ultrasavers.com what you might not know are all of the reasons that make ultra sabres the absolute worst i'm gonna i'm gonna go over a few of them right now here are three fun facts about ultra sabres number one they have an f as in frank rating on the better business bureau if you've ever been to school then you know that's not a good rating to have number two their employees gave it a one star rating on indeed.com calling it a chinese sweatshop in america number three the official lightsaber subreddit a small group of lightsaber enthusiasts officially and publicly denounced ultrasavers.com for their immoral business practices that's a big deal there are so many other reasons why they're the worst instead of going over them all i'm just gonna link to this video up here by lando savers for all of you who enjoy listening to horror stories that's fun number five genesis custom savers have you ever tried searching youtube for like how to build a lightsaber and you come across that thumbnail of the guy with a really long beard and that yellow neopixel lightsaber that is rob pacau and that's definitely how you pronounce his last name and he's a legend and genesis custom sabers is his store that's his brand the designs he makes are just absolutely insane seriously i didn't know lightsabers can look as good as some of the things he's made before in the past like look at this right now that's crazy but his prices certainly reflect that level of craftsmanship his entry-level lightsabers cost about 500 and every now and then he auctions off his elite custom lightsabers that range from two thousand dollars to well over three thousand dollars that is a lot of credits but if i were made of money and i can only purchase one lightsaber in the world it'd probably be something from rob his designs the weathering the acid etching even the wiring on the inside is all just gonna be super well done and reliable and top of the line also this has nothing to do with lightsabers but rob also made a star wars beer fridge that i would probably do absolutely anything in the world for rob please make me a beer fridge number four saber forge is a difficult company to recommend because a lot like ultra sabers despite being one of the biggest players in the industry there is a lot of controversy surrounding them some of the complaints i've heard about saber forge are primarily in regards to very poor customer service exceptionally long shipping times and poor quality control i have ordered from them once through their etsy page and i had a really good experience their customer service was perfect and i got my lightsaber within three weeks which is just unheard of right but if you're going to order directly from the website instead of through their etsy page you can expect your phone calls voicemails and emails to never get replied to you can expect to receive your order within two to twelve two to twelve months and three you can expect something to be wrong with your lightsaber lightsaber hilts are often defective or fragile especially thin neck lightsabers so be careful and their electronics are often faulty or just stop working and if you've seen my video where i unbox my brand new saber forge adept lightsaber which i will link up here for you if you didn't then you know that i can personally attest to all of this so why do i have saber forge on this list in the first place one reason and that is variety sabreforge.com has the biggest variety of lightsaber hilts in parts that i've ever seen on any lightsaber company's website ever they have a lot of inventory if you've been struggling to find the exact replica character hilt that you want i would definitely recommend looking on sabreforge's website otherwise i see no reason that you should buy from them i'm sorry number three savory trio is a newer lightsaber company but one that's quickly becoming a favorite from my understanding it's primarily due to their exceptional customer service in fact earlier this year they actually stopped accepting orders entirely due to shortages in their supply chain and why is that so special and important for me that i have to say this in a video well because some of the other lightsaber companies would never do something like that like saber forged and ultra sabers that's why they have such long shipping times if they ever run into supply issues they're not gonna cancel your order or stop accepting new orders they're gonna no no keep coming keep coming yeah we'll get you your stuff eventually we'll just keep stringing you along in order to not lose that business but not saber trio saber trio works super hard on their product and on their customer satisfaction and it's really working for them they have eight different hills to choose from options for heavy-grade neopixel blades different finishes weathering or acid etching emitter shrouds oled screens activation switches cover tech wheels and blade plugs their website is probably the best website i've ever seen from any lightsaber company and what really stood out to me was their checkout process so raise your hand if you've ever tried buying a lightsaber and you get to the part where you have to choose all your like electronics and your blade types and strengths and styles and all that and there's just so many options you just got overwhelmed and you just quit entirely yeah me too saber trio actually explains what all those options are imagine that number two is corvette corvanth is a community favorite widely recognized for their super high quality replica lightsaber hilts with neopixel blades and top-of-the-line sound boards like the cfx or the profit i've only been able to find like three negatives about coral banff a some of their more popular health are hard to come by because they sell in limited quantities and they sell up fairly quickly b there's not a lot of variety and c they're kind of pricey their empty hilts start at 225 dollars and their neopixel and solid hilts start at 595 dollars and finally here we are number one vader's vault widely recognized for their exceptional quality hilts now even though i've never purchased anything from vader's ball or coral bands before everyone seems to agree that these two companies are ultra super dope but the reason i put vader's ball up a little bit higher was because a they have a lot more variety than corbath and b they offer this special bluetooth upgrade feature that seems to be one of those things that you can't really live with that once you've tried it and that's because every time you want to make a change even small change like adding one single font without bluetooth you would have to disassemble your entire lightsaber take out the sound card then you take the little microsd you plug it into your computer you open up the program you make whatever changes you want take out the little micro sd you put it back two hours later you reassemble your lightsaber you turn it on you reboot it and then you test and hopefully it works the way you want it to or else you're gonna have to redo that entire that sounds exhausting if you're buying from invaders vault and the lightsaber you chose has that bluetooth upgrade option definitely spend a few extra dollars for that one of the downsides to vader's vault all of their lightsaber hilts are made to order vader's vault waits to get an order and then they start building lightsabers specifically for that order therefore you can expect your lightsaber to take several months to arrive that kind of sucks that being said they do have special sales events where you can buy ready to ship lightsabers and those will arrive within a couple weeks i guess they're like orders that were cancelled throughout the year and then like on black friday or christmas or something they'll just like unload all that that's an option for you so those are seven lightsaber companies that i think you should know about right now but let me know down in the comments if you think i missed any or if you disagreed with the list in any way i'm always looking for other points of view especially for hot topics such as these and of course if you already have your own lightsaber hilt and at this point you're just looking to learn how to install all the electronics i'm currently in the middle of a lightsaber building series and next week we're going to cover what lightsaber soundboards are and what the best soundboards on the planet are at the moment so until then you will subscribe to this youtube channel we will keep on living star wars and ultra sabres is the period worst period ever period and don't buy anything from them ever [Music] period", "hZAvPPd0INM": "okay let's jump forward a hundred years to the year 2120. come on play along you're in the stands for the finals of your beloved sport fencing your two favorites are going up against each other lightsaber noises are the most intense sounds in the room you can almost feel the walls vibrate plasma going up against plasma the contestants are both wearing protective gear made from a material plasma can't cut through that's the sound they make when they're cutting through air steel fencing swords are a thing of the past lightsabers are what's cool now just the other day during thanksgiving you could see your neighbor from your window he was using his own lightsaber to cut through his turkey all his knives must fit dirty he sent you a picture afterwards and as it turns out it ended up being a little too well done after the heat from the plasma well back to this year lightsabers are still not real but they are something everyone would love to get their hands on they're about as futuristic and fun as swords can get imagine a blade made of plasma that comes out and retracts whenever you want and the only thing you have to carry around is a handle in star wars they were also called laser swords well it makes sense remember those tiny little lasers you played around with when you were a kid those were fun they were the size of your finger and could help you point at anything they had that red light that came out from one end cats went nuts for them too they still do if you have a laser and you point it at the wall with your cat paying attention it'll instantly run at it if you turn it off they'll be all confused and start looking everywhere for it some dogs too in the movies lightsabers are used both offensively and defensively there's no need for a shield like in ancient times they also cut through almost everything except other lightsabers still the one thing star wars universe has that we don't is the material that makes lightsabers possible kyber crystals those don't actually exist technically building a lightsaber is possible although hard since you know we're not jedis or mandalorians the first thing you need to make your lightsaber dream a reality is plasma and you might be wondering what exactly is plasma it's superheated matter and often called the fourth state of matter the first three states are solid liquid and gas plasma makes up over 99 percent of our visible universe at night you can see it in the form of stars nebulas and those lights you can see at the north and south poles it's controllable too with the help of magnetic forces you can mold and shape plasma but for it to work like it does in the movies you'd need very large and bulky equipment and that wouldn't exactly fit in your hand we don't know for sure what size it would have to be but imagine it's the size of a car all excited you tell your friends you have a lightsaber but it's in your garage still very impressive you all walked your house open your garage door and there it is your very own bulky large plasma equipment thing it has a switch on the side for the plasma to come out you press it and a two foot beam of blue plasma flies up to the ceiling your friends are in awe it's the first time they've seen the fourth state of matter after you turn it off you can see the spot on the ceiling where the plasma hit it left a mark it's definitely not safe to store outside what if someone tries to play with it this equipment would also need to be as powerful as a nuclear reactor let's leave those at the nuclear power plants for now there are people who already built a somewhat realistic lightsaber or protosaber the way they did this was by having the plasma eject out of a metal handle they had to carry around a backpack to fuel the plasma otherwise it wouldn't have worked the key ingredient for this whole thing is laminar flow laminar flow is when the particles of a fluid all flow in parallel lines the other type of flow is more wacky scientific word which is where the particles flow randomly and in opposite directions if it wasn't for laminar flow the plasma from the lightsaber would take off in any direction it felt like the lightsaber's fuel is liquid gas which combined with oxygen and a spark allows the plasma to flow in a straight line and to be controlled so to start with the gas from the fuel backpack flows in a laminar flow which is then directed into the lightsaber's handle the fuel has to be highly concentrated then you need a spark after this the plasma will be ejected from the handle and that's it you've got a lightsaber this plasma beam will burn at insanely high temperatures which means it can cut through a lot of stuff or you know burn it all this means is that technically a real life lightsaber is possible but you'd have to lug around a massive backpack with fuel and combine it with oxygen to ignite it which is a very dangerous thing to do but unlike in the movies it's not sturdy like a sword would be it's a flow of plasma and when you try to cut things with it the plasma flow won't stay exactly the same another option for a real life lightsaber is a proto saber proto sabers need fuel to operate and are very dangerous too simply put they're really hot blades that burn so bright that have almost the same appearance as a lightsaber now if you still want a lightsaber but don't want to take the risks that come with it awesome led lightsabers exist they're fairly simple usually they're just a tube that contains an led and when you press the button it turns it on it shines bright like a real lightsaber some of them will make the zoom noise too they're a thousand times safer and you can even buy them as gifts there's also the option of a laser lightsaber it's just a handle like a normal laser but a lot more powerful than the ones you used to play with these ones come with warnings because of how powerful they are you might even have to wear glasses to protect your eyes they can even be powerful enough to cut through stuff okay but what if you just want to play with plasma but not a lightsaber you still can there are plasma globes you can buy and play around with a plasma globe is a glass sphere that contains a lot of odorless colorless single atom gases that won't explode or anything they have an electric conductor in the middle and when you feed some voltage through it you get plasma inside the globe because your body conducts electricity when you place your hand on one of these globes energy flows into it it's pretty cool because you can see plasma in action with the help of a small container bam technology when real lightsabers come around we're probably going to be at a place in time where spaceships might actually exist i mean real spaceships okay picture this you wake up one morning feeling like you want to take a trip but not to anywhere on earth you've already seen too much of it so you pick up your lightsaber handle and put it safely in your pocket then you take a look at your wristband tap it twice and your holographic phone pops out book me a seat two weeks from now on the next earth to mars flight please and you go about your daily life you walk out the door and get on your wheel this motorbike it has jet propellers where the wheel should be and they swirl around so you're able to control the direction you're going after taking the high up in the sky invisible road made just for flying vehicles you arrive at your office you sit on your comfortable chair ready to get some work done today you're in the mood for something different and you decide you want to work in paris no worries you turn on the holographic scenery and there you are two weeks later you embark on the spaceship you bought a ticket for earlier that month ready for a new adventure wait a life hey doesn't that guy over there look like arnold schwarzenegger", "n_ctHxgjCtk": "hello there what's going on everybody today we're gonna be taking a look at the count dooku forcefx black series lightsaber from star wars the black series has bros uh pretty cool line of lightsabers i've done quite a bit of these i've definitely been looking forward to this one just look at that curved handle and the little red button there i wonder if that's the actually the button to turn it on if you are new here to the channel i'm giving away a 25 amazon gift card all you have to do is be a subscriber leave a comment on this or one of my videos that's all it takes to enter any of my giveaways and they're running all the time i usually announce winners towards the end of videos so make sure you enter that if you liked the video go ahead and give it a thumbs up don't forget to share and all that other good stuff but for now let's go ahead and take a look at this count dooku lightsaber all right so i've cut the tape and we're going to open this thing up i did pick this up from gamestop i know a lot of people tend to always ask me where i get my lightsabers and i get them from usually from gamestop or think geek which are part of the i think the same company um and yeah here's everything that comes inside we're gonna have our little instruction booklet a little uh little pamphlets of all that good stuff um a lot of foam cover everything here's the handle right here we've got a stand right here in the middle and some other stuff over here i'm curious i don't know what the oh this is gonna be our battery uh compartment as well as some of the accessories for the stand and uh this is i believe this is the curved part which it's harder for them to that we have the same problem with the asajj ventress lightsabers is that it's curved so much it doesn't fit in this in a slim box so this is probably going to be like that the end curve piece that kind of goes on there um i don't believe though that this is going to uh fit with any of the other sabers it's definitely almost certainly not going to fit with asajj ventress's saber but you know what we'll we'll kind of compare them and see let me get this thing out of the box all right so here it is fully assembled and it is really beautiful i think this may be the most beautiful saber they have made yet this one maybe even tops mace windu's if you want to check some of those out too make sure you watch to the end of the video put some links as you can check some of the other sabers and other collectibles i've done but this thing is not just just incredible like i i feel like i feel nasty just touching it like my getting fingerprints on and stuff i'll just have to um i don't know wipe it down i guess uh after usage i just wow man this is great now it's got the belt clip on there which i don't know why because i don't believe the blade comes off so why would you you know it's not like i'm going to wear but i think they i think just about all of them have a belt clip on there even without the blades coming off it's like uh like maybe you would want to potentially uh wear it equipped with the blade dangling or maybe you have some kind of wall mounted belt clip um watch i don't know but yeah this we've got some holes in the bottom here for the sound to come out uh this is not a button uh this is just decoration so that's uh the the actual switch is gonna be right here we'll turn it on in just a moment but uh yeah we've got this little uh little um i don't even know what you want to call this a little the i guess bottle opener i guess you know count dooku likes himself a heineken from time to time so uh so yeah he's got to do that um and then we got our little gold or electrum piece right up here on the top this is this is really something a pretty standard blade uh just kind of like all of them we've got the the tip is gonna be the that's certainly uh that you know the not white part and just in case you were so you don't try and stab anybody with it so it's nice and rounded uh let's go ahead and turn this thing on here we're gonna slide this switch up i feel like it's got a deeper hum than some of the other ones i'm going to compare this to some other ones here in a minute but it sounds a little different it's also very heavy too um i think that's worth pointing out this um it sounds good we're gonna we're gonna check we're gonna like uh see how it looks like we're gonna get some full body shots of it in action but um i really like these handles here like this is kind of like a plasticky a different textured feel to help the grip um i like that a lot and we get that here we got that here we also get it down here on this bottom part this screwing part is right here and so this it actually has an interesting assembly uh i'll tell you i'll we'll take it apart here in a little bit and show you how it assembles because it assembles different than every other lightsaber let's go ahead and uh get some complete uh some action shots of this thing all right so we're going to fire this thing up and i mean i love the curved part it's a little awkward to handle but like you know christopher lee did it so much better than i can but here we go now it's very bright in here so you're probably not getting uh a full sense of the glow um but yeah that's oh yeah i just want to go you know i always want to have a downward kind of facing you know now i think if you're gonna duel with a blade like this and it does it's got a pretty good feedback mechanism it it's not doing the clashes though it's just doing the words yeah this one doesn't clash i don't know if i just got a weird one or usually they do a combination of words and clashes but i think if you are going to duel with something like this you've got to work on your your lingo and your dialect you disappoint me young skywalker twice the pride double the fall you stink like unwashed butt oh there we go i got a slash out of it i got an eye i guess you have to say that somebody stinks like unwashed butt yeah every time i said an unwashed butt it goes off let's try it you stink like unwashed booty yeah maybe it's because i'm hitting it harder smashing my table here let's try and turn the lights down a little bit and see if that fixes it all right so i've got the lights turned way down hopefully this will help and let's see oh you can see that glow now i feel my sith quips just chiming ah i expected better twice the pride doubled the lightsabers oh you would make a terrible apprentice because you smell like unwashed feet and butt and stinky pants i i think christopher lee does i think dooku does a better job than i do at that i gotta work on my dialect a little bit man this looks really good in the dark it's heavy though man it's you get tired winglets too often and i'm gonna break everything else in here i'm gonna knock down vader's helmet and all that other stuff all right that's pretty cool right i want to do a couple of comparisons and interesting things first off i've got the asajj ventress saber right here um and i really feel like uh the comparison is night and day as far as quality massages certainly looks like hers but it's just so more so much more subdued it looks more like um like there's the plastic whereas this one's like all metal and and so much better you know so i really like that one also in case you were thinking of trying to uh come you know connect to the two assassins has a very unique type of connector piece that requires both pieces have the side uh the side screws so and of course dooku's does not have that so there's no way to connect these um as far as the sounds go yeah dooku's is deeper [Applause] i mean the ver it's almost the same sound but i feel like this one got turned like the tone got turned a little bit deeper i mean it might just be my ears playing with me but i think dooku's is a little deeper uh we've got mauls here and the interesting thing about malls is that if you have the the double bladed connector piece on mauls you don't have the single bladed um uh end piece uh it looks like this and we're gonna again we're gonna show you how it connects here um how do coos because it looks like we might have the same kind of grooves um so this whole thing is really interesting because our battery pack again three triple a's you can't um it doesn't come with any aaa so you gotta provide your own right uh this is gonna go right in here and this one normally you slide them all the way in this one when you stick it in it's it's gonna just kind of sit outward like that and then this whole end cap is a really big end cap right but you can take this end cap it almost looks like you can put it on malls here we go i'm gonna try i'm gonna try it it's oh i mean like it kind of wants to fit it's almost the same there we go there we go like it goes on a little bit right so you can kind of combine models and dooku's just a little bit not exactly the same now this is uh you know mail to mail end so it's not like you can take malls and connect him well or can you can you let's see let's see if we can connect malls to to dooku's all right i'm gonna slide this in right here no it's a little no it doesn't quite it's almost there oh wait does it it does oh my goodness it does it fits now only one of them has power well no the moles is not pushed in all the way so you won't be able to ignite them but you can definitely connect them both look at that you can connect moles to dooku's what is this nonsense that's so cool all right all right um i guess the next step is to test mace when do is because mace windu also uh he's got like almost the same size because you can kind of connect mace windows to this also um so will he well mace windu's connects to jukus also oh i don't it feels like it it might i mean if you want a like an l bracketed yep yep there it goes it doesn't go in all the way but you can now also connect mace windus to uh and of course none of them are going to come on to dooku's so that's uh that's a little weird like now the it's not machined that that's the way it's supposed to be so i don't suggest doing that because if you force it too hard you might mess up the threading on the screws and then you know the end cap it may not connect perfectly anymore but like it is kind of possible of course now when you do that the reason why it like the blades wouldn't turn on is and now it should yeah the reason why is because these have to be pushed in like all the way and if the right cap isn't on there like instead of it being pushed in all the way it'll come loose a little bit and then you need the cap to push it in all the way and force the connection so really the best way to do it is just with their actual caps and and kind of do it the normal way now this does actually go all the way around to where the red is right in the center there so that's pretty cool all right the last part is the stand this is the same stand that comes with the ahsoka sabers uh and very similar to like some of the older style stands uh but a lot of the newer savers now just come with like a little curved c so but this one you know obviously we won't work with that so we can kind of fit the the blade part in there i think actually i think that's the way to do it right you want to put the little red switch just uh just behind that part and uh there it goes and it'll rest in there pretty nicely all right guys that's about all i've got if you like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up let me know what

officially through star wars merchandise now it has pro black series which you've got the license for the lightsabers but i've had those previously and i wanted something which was going to be a little bit different so this lightsaber is fashioned on from the phantom menace lightsaber with some subtle differences because obviously they can't copy this lightsaber when it's not an official lightsaber i think this one was called the guardian so it's a custom-made lightsaber and you can place and kind of create what you want with it you can take it they have a million mafia and just have it's a pure black lightsaber held um you get to choose the buttons on there as well the ignition buttons different bombers and and emitters on the top there as well now if i was to have a lightsaber i'm pretty sure when i bought this that my lightsaber was going to look something like this though i think it would look a little bit different now so reasons for getting this particular lightsaber was because i needed something for dueling with at my wedding darth vader showed up pulled a lightsaber choreographed a couple lightsaber jewels and i dumped music on the top and the sound effects and it turned into a little bit of a thing stars thing this lightsaber is heavy duty with a 36 inch blade with the pointy end here as well i always think the lightsabers look better with the pointy end at the top i think it just don't know it looks clone warsy to me so the blade is exceptionally durable and can take quite a bit of a hit which is you know perfect for so nerdy star wars people you are obviously going to use that lightsabers for fighting this i wanted it in a really bright color and i know that ultra sabers where i got this lightsaber from does very bright lightsabers so i wanted something which would look like a lightsaber if people were recording it on their camera this one is the color which i chose for for this lightsaber i think my favorite color is arctic blue and that's kind of like luke skywalker's color so that's what i opted for yeah and the lightsaber just has that really nice glacier blue and i love snowboarding and everything to do with snowboarding and skiing and things and seeing that sort of blue in the a ice i love it so much so i wanted a lightsaber which had that color it's got a really nice u of green coming out of the emitter the emitter this knot it's not a complicated lightsaber but for dueling which is what its original purpose was for it's perfect and it's perfect for the grip perfect for the ignition and it's smooth and feels great in your hand as well the beauty of these lightsabers is that you can use an allen screw key here undo it take out lightsaber change the blade it's so easy but the led here in here is super bright and i made a mistake of opening up and i saw it one time and yeah i won't be doing that again but this lightsaber it looks so great and realistic um especially on camera as well and for a proper nerdy star wars lover of lightsabers and this lightsaber i think looks i think it's probably one of my best looking ones for the blade the only problem is is when you turn this on and off it doesn't have the full ignition of leds going up it's just a one big bright led here so obviously it's going to be just on and off there but that is my guardian quick on gin start lightsaber which i used for dueling with at my wedding it go to the point uh this is pretty recent as well where i wanted to do some filming with lightsabers with a couple of enthusiasts unfortunately they are very rare to find uh near me and i don't have any lightsaber dueling bodies but this was a lightsaber purely purchased for that purpose so it literally is the barest of the bear lightsaber hills now this looks like it's literally just been done but on the lathe it's done all the grooves and it's quite textured and detailed along here and there's a little bit of relief here on the hilled grip and it's it's just plain but when you ask figured if you're using this then it's not going to be something you're going to worry about it will stir it because you're going to be using it overly quickly and fast and so a plain lightsaber was just easy and the right choice for me to get the i decided just to go pure silver nothing complicated so it was a chrome and which i thought looked just like a plain lightsaber that one of the jedi would just carry randomly and it would look awesome the ignition button here is even more basic it's just literally a bush and that is it it's just literally a clicky thing and it's nothing special about it except the brightness of this blade so legend batteries in there screw up and on the top of the hilter the emitter there is nothing there it's so thin but the thing i love about this lightsaber is this blader on here is it's got foil around it so it makes it even brighter so it looks even more realistic and lightsaber real on camera i hoped it for the point so the clone wars lights are a good point on the end there this ball which i think looks really cool this i think is a 32-inch lightsaber blade now there was a little bit of problem when i bought it because i wanted 36 on the lightsaber and they never got back to me so thanks ultra savers um but this was still a fine welcome to my collection purely because i can easily change the blade and i realized after holding this one this was my first green lightsaber but two when i pick it up and take it around the house it's the easiest thing just to swipe around the corridors without eating it i think those extra few inches for a normal size blade you will hit things with a 32 inch you don't hit anything and believe me it's it's perfect for indoor use but this with the green see what i mean it looks absolutely amazing in full length there as well so 32 inches with the pointy tip on the end there too but this is a proper luminous yoga quick on gin luke skywalker green and i love it so much i feel like i always wanted a green lightsaber i thought if i was ever a jedi even though i'd want a blue lightsaber i would probably end up getting a green one if i was picking my kyber crystal it would be green not that i'd be disappointed but i feel like it's a more rapid representation of my true self whereas i prefer the blue if that makes sense but that's about it for this lightsaber the hilt is very very plain the ignition button is very plain and the emitter and the pommel just simple simple but an amazing looking lightsaber as you can tell it looks so awesome now how awesome does you can't do it because hilt look so this is his notoriously curved lightsaber it's from hasbro black series and it looks amazing now the thing for me is like i used to look at lightsabers when i was in my teenage years like early teens 13 i used to look online 14 and i used to stare at the only fx lightsabers which were out there and that was the luke skywalker one and the darth vader and i thought it would just start dreaming of having it forever and i still haven't got that one but the master replica hilts and lightsabers were perfect master replicas were just amazing and i wish they were still going now because their hilts were true to size or pretty much um the only thing with this hasbro lightsaber and the ones that have created on the black series is that the hilts are just far too big they're too thick and not really jewel worthy there is a lot of weight in this big cumbersome hilt here and would it almost be impossible for him a good jewel if you would use it for those purposes now i love the count dooku lightsaber i think the clone wars and is showing more of dooku's one-handed fighting style like a gentleman with a sword which was almost like what christopher lee was anyway and i'm also a massive fan of it has a very iconic and unique style i think the first curved lightsaber i love the sort of emitter detail here this book whatever it is but it's just i can't do good thing it was almost imposing it has no use whatsoever except for looking awesome and being sophisticated there is quite a lot of detail which i really love i love the grip and the black grip along here this is got a sort of rubbery feeling to it it has gold detail there you can attach this on your belt near the pommel the pommel is really thick now i thought the lightsaber ignition would be here but in fact it's underneath here as well this really nasty sort of plasticky looking thing yes i don't know what they're thinking that but there we go the only problem which i have with the master replica lightsabers um as per black series is that you cannot remove the blade and this is the thing which i love to display the lightsabers but you can't really display it with the blade on it as well so look at the emitter here how wide that circumference circumferences and then this is a standard lightsaber blade so this is not realistic whatsoever that is not to scale it's too big and bulky so from that point of view i was a little bit disappointed and i really wanted the darth sidious one as well but i think it suffers from the same bulky problem though the lightsaber the fact that it's can't do good is i see past those things and i enjoy the lightsaber for what it is like i love collecting the different lightsabers from the jedi suit which i love from the star wars rooms so this one is of course a fine addition to my collection the sound comes out at the end there this screws out batteries in there and simple design ignition as you can tell it doesn't have the same sort of brightness as the ultra saber blades like this has the ignition through the blade which is called but it's just not bright enough and it doesn't look realistically bright like a lightsaber it looks a little bit generic mass produced and cheap and nasty but you pay a lot for it it is expensive but it doesn't feel like you want those features to it in this day and age where there's all these amazing lightsabers people are making and then they're still not able to surpass that that to me is a little bit of a turn off but the turn on is that it looks incredible and feels pretty incredible even though it's heavy but it's an awesome looking lightsaber and i'm glad that it's in my collection i'm sorry my old jedi friend impossibly outnumbered thank you so you could probably tell by the color it's that sort of time what i wanted for my dueling lightsabers was something to duel against so i opted for a black chrome looking lightsaber the old dear so once again for dueling purposes i wanted this just to be really really plain and didn't have any detail on there no relief or anything just simple cruising there for more grip purposes but apart from that it needed to kind of look like a lightsaber but the sith would use but close up i mean from a distance it's fine like it doesn't need to be anything special this lightsaber has to cruise um screws on there then you can use the other key to make sure that the blade is super safe i've got the same amazing blade there as well which makes it even brighter along with the clone wars dip there as well which i love the color of this blade anyway it's such a nice different surprise from the normal hasbro ones this connected up literally is just a middle piece and then screwed in and then you've got yourself a darth maul lightsaber now something which i loved from jedi academy the star wars game was the staff lightsaber choice you can have there that was awesome and i wanted to do the dueling with this so as you can notice from this like the light reflects on this uh very nicely and the beauty with these sabers and the selections i made here with ultrasabers is that you almost don't need to do any effects afterwards you don't need to do any after effects for the lightsaber because it looks so realistic uh dependent on your camera lighting there as well so you'll compare these to the hasbro black series these are in every respect lightsaber for the lightsaber look far superior like the others just look so amateur um but this is probably even more obsolete let's turn it on i mean that obsidian red is gorgeous but i know there are other lightsaber manufacturers like people who make them fans which are even better than this and they change color they've got clash sounds and effects on the light so it sort of goes a bit wide and when you're like deflecting plastic bullets and things so if you want to be your own one-man band jedi go around the house with your lightsaber deflect deflecting blaster bots which i probably would be up for that's something which i would love if you've got any recommendations for lightsabers and what i should check out i am always on the hunt for amazing ones and i would love to get a really really realistic one with options as well and that would be so awesome but this is for my future lightsaber dueling the blade is so realistic looking and it just shines perfectly like it looks so good but this plate on here is the 32 inch lightsaber plate as well so the shorter one but for a staff it's almost perfect it works perfectly um but i think i probably would have got the 36 as well just to be more of a jedi threat because that's what you got to do but this is a very basic build not much detail but the lightsaber itself looks awesome and this one's from ultra sabres whose delivery time might i say is abysmal i'm a little bit of a stickler when it comes to sort of preserving the star wars artifact shall we say or relics so i kept the original stickers on there as well which i probably should have taken off but it doesn't really bother me like i'm not really going to be using it for anything else and i took a celebration and i've swirled it around and bashed it around um but i still like to think that i've managed to keep that on the detailing on this lightsaber is absolutely amazing there are two versions of this lightsaber which you can use in this lightsaber and you can take off the connector and that will screw off the screen on the other side and you can put on like darth maul's chopped single lightsaber from the clone wars whereas the kuiper crystal was sort of sticking out at the end which i think it looks incredible but for my lightsabers i like just a little bit more length and a bit of weight in there as well not like the counter that's way overbought but for this because it's true to size realistic and screen accurate that i just needed something a little bit heavier in there but it looks so amazing like this is my favorite one one of my two favorite lightsabers and the only thing that lets it down is of course because of his age and i think master edward because if they were still going they would have probably sorted this out this isn't master regulus i don't think it is actually i think this could be the black series one of the first versions they did i can't remember but this is the better version because one it's a removable blade so you can literally display darth maul's hilt by itself which looks incredible and i'll probably be sticking that up my wall again at some point um but also this plate it has the led ignition on the lightsaber so it follows up the lightsaber but because of its age it's not really that bright at all and so in low light or any light it doesn't look as good as the ultrasabers but still the hilt makes up for every single part of that like the ignition buttons and the other buttons he's got there all the little bit of details is spot on and this is probably one of my trusted best looking lightsabers darth maul's one as you could tell where i've used it and probably hit it on various things then the led blades sort of disappear um but as you notice that because i've watched the film so many times that knowing the darth maul killer blow booze is like second nature to me i've watched it too many times but in action the blade still looks great build looks even better the plate not as good as that but still it's an amazing lightsaber and just to show what i was talking about with the bottom here now this is the recent version of the black series and i was so happy that it's pretty much identical identical to this one except for some reason you can't remove the blade it's not happening but both of them have the darth maul kyber crystal cut off in there as well so displayed separately they look great but together they look absolutely incredible so if you like this lightsaber then this is an absolute must for your collection so you can fiddle around with an allen screw on the inside to leverage it make sure it goes level but together it's amazing and that this is all i ever wanted when i was a kid i could only imagine the amount of fun i would have had with this if i had access to it when i was a kid i mean this would have been the real deal but it looks amazing if it just had the option to remove the blade then i could display it perfectly how i always wanted it and put some of any ds to shine up in it as well that would look so awesome there but that's the darth maul crystal on them looks pretty great news grid and you get that along with the middle pit on both but the texture on this is amazing the chrome finish the sort of a matte and then it just looks perfect it looks used properly because it is but worn and aged and like a fine wine and this to me is one of my favorite lightsabers which i have in the collection and as you can tell it looks great there's no denying it for the lightsaber fan it's one that you really should have and finally hello there this is obi-wan kenobi's phantom menace and attack of the clones lightsaber which i got recently as a gift and it's the lightsaber which i always wanted as an effects lightsaber this is the plastic version when i was a child but this to me is perfection and the thing of beauty now i think that it might be just a little bit thinner than the actual screen used version but i could be wrong the thing which i would have loved if they used this sort of chromie finish in all of the lightsaber and this is my dear i think it's more chrome on the real thing on the emitter and i would have just given it the extra bit for fanboy like myself this lightsaber is the grip and i just love how it flows around there and this black and chrome intertwined with one another it looks so great and i just was addicted to the special features of the pre-chores when i was younger i still watched them religiously that moment when ewan mcgregor gets his lightsaber and he goes for this one i mean this is the one i would have gone for as well the pommel is exceptionally unique and it's just different and it just i think for me this is like a perfection in design and it is incredibly beautiful for someone who loves lightsabers now i think they did a great job with this but once again there's just slight things like with the brightness as you can tell it's not a bright lightsaber or realistic looking blade whatsoever it has the ignition which is cool but apart from that i think it really lets it down and i wish they just caught up and put some effort in making it look realistic and bright like the others it does have sound which is good it's not amazing like they could be amazing and i'm sure they'll be even more special and but it's good like it's it's very enjoyable for the lightsaber but i think the main thing i once did because of course it's obi-wan kenobi and this will be very useful for that future project i'm working on and hopefully uh this will have a star roll although i really wish that i could remove the blade from here i mean you can get kids which you can do that and you can pop the blade out and have it on display i would love so much to get my hands on one of the master replica full scale movie replica obi-wan kenobi hills and quite conscience as well that would be amazing have them on display they'll be my prize possessions along with darth sidious one i've been trying to get this lightsaber for ages but i just can't seem to find the right one and when i did through external sources it's always out of stock but i love the sidious lightsaber so much because he's just amazing with it in revenge of the set and there we have it that hopefully is my most relaxing show and of my lightsaber collection i have quite a nice collection here i'd say a modest collection for various uses and purposes but like i said i would love to get my hands on the series the series one would be amazing along with removable blades for the other one i've had my eye on mace windows one for very long time too and i'd love to add that to the collection this they will all be going on my wall and they will look so great together i just never got around to actually putting them on there along with all my other star wars posters original posters which i collect um i'm a little bit of a star wars collector but lightsabers are something i love so i hope you've enjoyed the show-and-tell and looking at these lightsabers and admiring them and seeing me of course like turn them on use them and pretend to fight like an absolute shadow but there we go i love them so much and hopefully this was turned into a nice sleepy asmr video for you too if you've got a common interest of lightsabers as the same as me okay so hope you've got inspired somehow or just tingles or anything there but let me know your favorite lightsaber pillow because that is something which interests me greatly we all have our favorites and here are mine so hope you're nice and tingled relaxed sleepy take care of yourself cheerio you", "8PAGaZl-jXA": "okay this mod is very simple it's a lightsaber mod two imposters have

after this video various comments by you guys inspired me to make a video about every different lightsaber variation that we know of specifically in Star Wars Canon in Star Wars legends there's simply too many but I'm sure we'll make individual videos on all of those lightsaber variant in today's video though I wanted to go over every single type of variant of lightsaber that we know of in Star Wars Canon the ones that we've made specific videos on I won't touch on for too long but I will link several videos on them in the description down below if you'd like to check those out again for the final time just to make sure we don't get any comments about it all the lightsabers described in this video do fall under canon so if there's a lightsaber variation that's missing on this video it may fall under Star Wars legends with introductions out of the way let's go ahead and begin with the video one more little note though there may be changes to Star Wars Canon as we move on so if there's a lightsaber added to Star Wars Canon I'll be sure to cover that in a separate video the first lightsaber is of course the standard lightsaber he'll the standard lightsaber he'll normally only produced a single plasma blade of varying colors the blade though did not change blade length and of course this is the most common lightsaber that we see in Star Wars Canon and there's not really much to add to it again though specifically the blade here only produces a single length and you cannot switch between various blade lengths the next light saber is the double bladed lightsaber whose first appearance was made in Star Wars The Phantom Menace by Darth Maul a double bladed lightsaber normally had a longer hilt to account for the extra crystals placed within the lightsaber itself of course which allowed it to produce two blade in Star Wars Canon we've seen a few people used this double bladed lightsaber most predominantly Sith Lord we've seen characters again like Darth Maul Savage Opress and one Jedi pong Krell used double bladed lightsaber although they were far more rare than a standard hilt lightsaber and were considered far more darkside in nature although again some Jedi would in fact use a double bladed lightsaber next up we have a dual phase lightsaber which this is the lightsaber type whose blade can actually change Lane the most notable characters in the Star Wars mythos that had a dual phase lightsaber were Darth Vader and Count Dooku both famous Jedi killers who would change the length of their blade throughout a lightsaber duel although Darth Vader would change the length of his lightsaber far more often than Dooku would this was considered a little bit more of a complex lightsaber design but it simply changed the emitter shroud and the length of the blade could be switched with the button again this is another variation of the lightsaber that is a little bit more dark side in origins one of the key powers of a dual phase lightsaber is of course deception making your enemies believe that the length of your lightsaber is one length when in reality you can change that with the switch of a button something that both Dooku and Darth Vader did several times to kill Jedi the most notable feature with this is when Darth Vader was constantly changing the length of his lightsaber in his duel with obi-wan Kenobi on the first Death Star in an attempt to keep his master at a longer distance than he normally would a Jedi as of course it was because of the hand of obi-wan Kenobi that Darth Vader was trapped within his cybernetic suit and Darth Vader was far more cautious in this duel than nearly any other that we've ever seen the next lightsaber variant is known as the broad saber which we covered just a few days ago basically the emitter of a broad saber made the lightsaber looked more like a normal sword would but the lightsaber not being really rounded but made to look like it had sharp edges on it as we covered in that video normally only form1 practitioners would use the broad saber form one sheet show was specially tooled to take on multiple adversaries at a single time and the form required wide sweeping movements of the saber thus wide the broad saber was most popular among form 1 masters but a lightsaber variant that most Jedi actually frowned upon in the Star Wars mythos as they considered it far inferior to the normal lightsaber standard blade next up is the Cain lightsaber which we've seen twice to my knowledge in Star Wars Canon one time by Maul in the rebel series as he used it in the Star Wars rebels series to appear weaker than he really was a Cain lightsaber is pretty self-explanatory it's a light saber that's hidden within a cane another Jedi to use a cane lightsaber was Terrace a new Bey who again was one of the oldest jedi masters of the era and because of this fact his reflexes were slowing and he wanted to have quick access to his lightsaber thus why he constructed his lightsaber within his cane something else interesting about Terrace a new Bey's lightsaber is it's actually white in coloration making this the first appearance of a white lightsaber blade in Star Wars Canon far before ahsoka donned hers next up we have an max lightsaber or rather a contained energy axe as it was known in Star Wars Canon a contained energy axe again used the power of a Kyber crystal and was most commonly used by Sith Lords it was also a weapon that the Jedi and most of the Sith in fact also considered inferior to even a standard lightsaber which is why we really don't know of anyone specific using this lightsaber type however we do know that it was in fact utilized most notably during the Old Republic era the emitter shroud was actually changed to form an axe instead of a normal saber of course why it's called a contained energy axe next up we have a cross carded lightsaber which was popularized by the villain of the sequel trilogy kylo Ren the cross guard design of a lightsaber is actually an ancient design with kylo Ren opting to construct a cross guarded lightsaber because the Kyber crystal placed within his lightsaber was crap way before the era of kylo Ren though a cross guarded lightsaber was extremely common the cross guard was actually built to let excess energy flow throughout the lightsaber as a cross guarded lightsaber wasn't really used for offensive purposes with the cross guard itself instead it was just a way to expel excess energy placed within the Kyber crystal as the designs of a lightsaber were not quite perfected yet we again see another cross guarded lightsaber in Star Wars rebels at the site of an ancient Sith temple it is believed that kylo Ren actually found the designs of an ancient cross guarded lightsaber and that this is how he modified his original Jedi weapon again though it should be made clear that the cross guarded lightsaber design is one that was used by both the ancient Jedi as well as the ancients it next up we have one of my favorite variants of a lightsaber the curved hilted lightsaber popularized by Count Dooku a curve tilted lightsaber is also a more ancient design for a lightsaber type and was developed in an era where lightsaber combat was far more frequent among the Jedi this is why when Dooku decided to create a curve tilted lightsaber it shot many members of the Jedi Council including Yoda again as we mentioned earlier Dooku's lightsaber also had a dual phase function other notable curved lightsabers than the Star Wars mythos include asajj ventress and even as sokka's 2 white lightsabers the weapon was developed specifically for lightsaber duel and because of the unconventional angle it was much more difficult to combat in a lie Sabre dual something interesting about this light saber variant is it was popular among both the Jedi as well as the Sith it was also said it was easier to lunge at an opponent using a curved tilted light saber as the curve tilted lightsaber was specialized by those using form two lightsaber combat mawkish II next up we have a lightsaber variant known as the great lightsaber which was an oversized lightsaber essentially the great lightsabers were often used by larger individuals and aliens in the Star Wars galaxy the blades emitted were also far more powerful because of the elongated hilt and normally more or a larger Kyber crystal a normal human in the Star Wars galaxy would struggle a great deal to even he was a great light saber and its longest a great lightsaber could be over two meters in length the great lightsaber is such a rare weapon in Star Wars Canon that we don't really know if anyone that used one just larger individuals in the galaxy the closest we get really is Jedi master pong crown who used to double bladed lightsaber that were in fact larger than normal as pong Krell was a massive individual next up we have one of the most rare lightsabers we know of in Star Wars Canon or even not really a lightsaber at all although it does technically fall under that category next up we have what is known as a light foil unlike foil was a type of lightsaber that was developed by the ancient Sith Lords and was much smaller than a standard lightsaber essentially what a light foil was was a fencing sword although of course it was produced using a plasma blade a light foil was most commonly used with form two lightsaber combat mawkish II the same form that Count Dooku used and again this is another lightsaber that we don't really know a lot about other than the fact that most commonly ancient Sith Lords used it and it hasn't really ever even been seen in the more recent Star Wars Canon something else interesting about the light foil is this is the most popular type of lightsaber among non force users as it was considered slightly more easy to wield than a normal lightsaber would be therefore although it was rare some non force users did possess light foils something else unique about the light foil is it was specifically a one-handed weapon as it was far too small to place both of your hands on it stay tuned on the channel as I will be doing a more in-depth analysis on the light for yo lightsaber for now though let's move on to a lights sabre pistol a lightsaber pistol is only a lightsaber that we've ever seen one individual use in Star Wars Canon that being Azra Bridger this was as rubra Jers first lightsaber after being apprenticed to kanan jarrus jedi knight a lightsaber pistol was really rare because most Jedi in fact frowned upon blasters however as fans of Star Wars rebels no Ezra Bridger was not trained as a conventional Jedi Knight the main reason that Ezra constructed a lightsaber like this is he wanted to be able to openly carry his lightsaber without Imperials and others knowing what it really was therefore why it looked far more like a blaster than a normal lightsaber and was not illegal during the time of the Empire again though as Roe would ultimately change his lightsaber design and create a second more standard green lightsaber after this lightsaber was destroyed by Darth Vader the blasters produced by this lightsaber were also not lethal as they were meant more to stun than anything the next lightsaber type that we'll discuss on this list though is far more strange than even a lightsaber pistol a lightsaber rifle in Canon we've only ever seen one individual use a lightsaber rifle that being Jocasta knew something unique about the lightsaber rifle is unlike most things that have to do with Star Wars it does not exist in legends continuity at all only Canon the lightsaber rifle was seen first and only in the Darth Vader Dark Lord of the Sith series where it was revealed that the lightsaber rifle was an ancient design and the only lightsaber rifle could be found deep within the Jedi archive temple again Jocasta nu is the only individual that we know of that has ever wielded a lightsaber rifle the way the weapon functioned is Jocasta nu placed a lightsaber within the rifle as a sort of plasma Amma following this and he beams of energy that were shot were extremely deadly and destructive we also know that the only reason shall cost a new use this lightsaber rifle was because she was extremely overpowered by skill and strengthened the force by Darth Vader and had to fall back on this as a final resort something else we know about the lightsaber rifle is if a light timber is placed within it you only have around five shots until the weapon begins to smoke and unfortunately is no longer functional and requires yet another lightsaber to be placed within it although we don't know much about the lightsabre rifle it's believed that it's an experimental ancient Jedi weapon in something of course that is not even really commonly known about in the Star Wars mythos unfortunately the only example of a lightsaber rifle was destroyed by Darth Vader as he used the force to tear it apart causing it to explode next up we have a weapon known as a lightsaber pipe which was predominantly used by the Jedi Temple guards during the Clone Wars era a lightsaber Pike was more ceremonial than anything else and it is also theorized that this is an ancient version of a Jedi lightsaber having to do with of course why it has a yellow lightsaber blade as well as the unconventional design of a lightsaber as a double bladed lightsaber is more rare among the Jedi than even among the Sith but still the Jedi Temple guards use these lightsaber pipes thus far in Star Wars Canon we've only ever seen the Jedi wield lightsaber pikes however I do have a video on a single Sith Lord that was supposed to use a lightsaber pipe but this was ultimately cut from the star wars the clone war series we don't really know about the lightsaber pikes and their significance of the jedi temple guards and star wars canon as of right now we just know that the lightsaber pike was not the main weapon of the Jedi they used them into each Jedi Temple guard had their own specifically designed lightsaber as well as used the lightsaber pipe other than this though we don't really know a lot about the lightsaber Pike or the Jedi Temple guards for that matter but hopefully we will one day soon next up we have one of the most mysterious lightsabers in Star Wars Canon and a prize of darth vader the proto saber a proto saber was also a cross guarded lightsaber the proto saber as i stated was also a great prize of darth vader and was locked away in an imperial fortress near darth vader's castle on moose to farm something else unique about the proto saber is it was white in coloration and is the earliest known lightsaber that we know of in Star Wars Canon therefore white has the name of a proto Sabre all we really know about the proto Sabre is it's a major prize for Darth Vader as well as the earliest known lightsaber that we know about in Star Wars canon and resembles more of a sword than an actual lightsaber similar to a broad saber and asked about the proto Sabre behind-the-scenes the creators of it explained this is one of the earliest versions of a lightsaber that we know about in Star Wars Canon if not the earliest and was a weapon created far before even the standard cross guarded lightsabers were made in Star Wars Canon and wielded by the ancient Jedi and Sith a lightsaber the even predates the dark saber that was wielded by the Mandalorians unfortunately though this is all that we know next up of course is the dark saber itself the prized weapon of the Mandalorian leader pre visla and the lightsaber that was constructed by the first-ever Jedi Mandalorian parvis love the dark saber just like many of the other lightsabers we've discussed on this list are extremely unique in its construction at this point in time is a total mystery the blade of the dark saber is significantly shorter than a normal light saber and of course it also has a unique color in being black but sparking with electricity as described by Dave Filoni it also makes a very unique sound weapon is also more similar and designed to a samurai sword than an actual lightsaber next up we have a training lightsaber which were lightsabers that used a far less powerful Kyber crystal placed within them thus lowering their cutting ability and lethal miss a training lightsaber is pretty much self-explanatory it was a lightsaber specifically used in the training for lightsaber combat specifically though for Jedi younglings as described by various Jedi Masters their limited power meant their limited danger something else I should note though is it is possible for a normal lightsabers blade to be turned down and to be used as a training lightsaber it's believed though that no main Jedi Knight would ever use a training lightsaber as their main lightsaber weapon and was only something that was used in the training of young links and Padawans that were less skill and finally we had the last lightsaber type that we know of in Star Wars Canon the shoto lightsaber a lightsaber that was mainly that we know of used by Yoda as for his size it was the length of a standard lightsaber as well as was used by Jedi such as ahsoka tano as she used this as her secondary weapon basically a Shoto lightsaber is a miniaturised lightsaber for individuals that were a normal height they would often use a Shoto lightsaber as their secondary weapon again most common ahsoka tano something interesting about the shoto lightsaber is although it's extremely popular Star Wars legends only two people we have ever seen use it in Canon two people we've already mentioned in ahsoka tano as well as Yoda a shota lightsaber though is again another weapon that's pretty self-explanatory it's just a shortened lightsaber but now let's discuss the final lightsaber type in Star Wars Canon the double bladed spinning lightsaber a weapon that was uniquely used by the inquisitors during the Imperial era the weapon of course is a double bladed lightsaber that spin the weapon was designed to overwhelm order 66 survivors and was used by the inquisitors inquisitors being those that were meant to hunt down Jedi after order 66 as their master Darth Vader dealt with more pressing matters among the Empire again the weapon was designed to immediately overwhelm a Jedi as in most cases an Inquisitor would be instantly overmatched by the power of a Jedi Master a unique feature of the spinning double bladed lightsaber is it could actually be used to help the inquisitors glide something that's very controversial among Star Wars fans the weapon was designed to operate just as general grievous was it was meant to be flashy in therefore cause a Jedi to hesitate at which point the inquisitors would strike the weapon was developed because Darth Vader and Darth Sidious knew that the inquisitors would be overmatched by most Jedi at least most Jedi Masters therefore they needed to take them out quickly and the double bladed spinning lightsaber was born but there you have it guys there are all the different Canon types of lightsabers that we discussed in this video did I miss any and do you want me to do any specific videos on any of the lightsaber types that we discussed here if you've made it all the way to the end of this video thank you so much as I know it was really long again my friends thank you guys so much for your support on this youtube channel it's been phenomenal and I can't wait to keep producing Star Wars content for years to come thank you my friends as always so much for watching may the force be with you and have a great day before you go be sure to check out my other channel the marvelous wave where we talk all about the Marvel Cinematic Universe including news breakdowns and theories about all upcoming and past Marvel movies link to the channel is in the description below [Music]", "QjskBfcpqWU": "you're reckless little one you never would have made it as obi-wan's padawan [Music] but you might make it as mine hey what's happening everyone i'm sir james coming at you guys with another video and hopefully you guys are doing well today i'm here to finally give you guys my review on another new star wars galaxy such product that came out about a few weeks ago and this is going to be the other new now available legacy lightsaber which is the ahsoka tano clone wars lightsabers not to be confused with the ones that we've had since the opening of star wars galaxy's edge which are based on star wars rebels and right off the bat just want to kind of throw this out there is that my least favorite legacy lightsaber help from this lineup that they have at galaxy's edge is actually the ahsoka's rebels lightsabers just because of how big and chunky they are however these clone wars ones here i like a heck of a lot more compared to those just an for high but before we begin i also want to let you guys know since we have a brand new episode of the mandalorian please trade carefully if you are watching this video either during the live premiere or afterwards in the comment section because you never know if someone might be talking about the episode if you're planning to uh please keep it at least spoiler free be respectful to those in the star wars community as always and also before we begin i wanted to kind of give you guys a teaser for next friday's episode because i was kind of building the hype leading to it is for next friday we're going to be taking a look at the saber forge dark ray lightsaber so yes from episode nine boom oh yeah i've been having so much fun with this thing just to be quite honest but i think you guys are going to like that for sure but let's get back to these right here and before we actually go into i want to kind of mention something that's worth mentioning is that the ashley the voice of ahsoka tano she's been doing so many cool things lately and it's kind of cool to see the excitement enthusiasm she has and the passion for star wars because um when these became available there was actually she showed up at a lightsaber meetup which unfortunately for us here in california we can't do because disneyland is still closed but disney world has been open for some time now which again i'm jealous for anyone that's able to go there and have fun um but she showed up at the lightsaber meetup uh that was hosted by the discord page for star wars galaxy's edge which i'll put a link down to that below if you guys want to check that out and um not only did she surprise people there but she actually had signed the first 200 set of pills unfortunately mine's not assigned one because mine was long after so i'm here at disney's hollywood studios and tonight the lightsaber discord is meeting up for a group photo in the two and what they don't know is that we've arranged to launch ahsoka tano's clone wars legacy lightsabers tonight just for them and i'm going to surprise their group photo they also don't know that i've spent all day signing um several hundred lightsabers so they're going to be the first to purchase the circus lightsabers and for the first couple hundred they're autographed so i can't wait to surprise everyone all right maybe one day i'll get an actual sign star wars product i still don't have anything officially um but yeah she had signed a 200 of the health so the first 200 people to buy the set of sabres actually had a signed box which was awesome and just recently i was reading um today or yesterday depending on when this video goes up actually it'll be a friday she was also at the disney springs location in florida and she had signed an additional 17 boxes that so for anyone that got one that signed you guys are very lucky and i'm really jealous so why if you got one let me know down below as far as are these available here at the california local location for downtown disney as of the recording of this video i haven't heard anything for us here in california but disney world and the disney springs location they do have them over there just so you guys know now as far as the pricing of these sabres uh this is going to be the same price as the rebels version at 200 as always you get well in this case you get two sets of hilts and this nice crate here and this is the symbol that's going to be located right there on the very front and if do you get any blades with these the answer are going to be no the blades are also going to be sold separately now i don't have the correct blade sizes i do have the one from my savvy saver and i do have like a 36 inch one i know i needed like a smaller blade but this is the best that i got just a little bit of a quick reminder for you guys but again the blades are sold separately now the coolest thing because i always get asked questions for legacy lightsabers is can you change the color or can you change the kyber crystals which the answers have always been no because these don't use kyber crystals they're not like a saudis workshop lightsaber but these are the first legacy lightsabers that can change color because as you guys know ahsoka and the clone wars she had a green and the other one the shoto one that was like more of a yellowish color they never called it yellow i forget what the official term they gave it but that was her colors in the clone wars and then in the last season when she got her lightsabers back from anakin anakin mentioned that he made a he made an improvement to them which became now blue for the colored blades and that's the colors that you get well mine is that yellowish color you don't get that one with this just a little bit of white you'll see in just a moment um but let me just kind of show you guys how it looks in the packaging it's a nice clean uh setup with both hilts neatly packaged in there like i said i like these way more than the rebels version i mean don't get me wrong i like the rebel design it's just the legacy version that we got was too chunky i didn't like that these ones feel a heck of a lot better so disney did a nice improvement for these so let me go ahead and show you guys the showto one first so this is the smallest of the hill and i'll bring the other one up and then i'll do the comparison and size so here is the first one here these right here the markings that's just a sticker i kept it on just so that way you guys can make where this is basically showing actually we'll start with here um we actually have a cover tech wheel so you can go ahead and clip this onto a belt right here this is going to be up for on and down for off so you're on and off switch so it's on the side with the cover tech wheel here and then of course you unscrew the pommel to get access to your battery pack which will be using triple a batteries so it's a pretty simple setup if you look inside there is a see if i can showcase see that little crevice there that little piece is sticking out it's basically going to be used to align the little crevice in this battery pack here just align the two pieces up like so there you go like so and go ahead and screw that bottom in and then there you go and of course the metal where your blade will go in now let me go ahead and bring over the other one this is the larger one between the two because she does have two different sizes this one is similar but slightly different at the same time for example on the top here you can see that you have the bunny ear design that's sticking on the left and right hand side these don't press down or do anything as well right here on the control box this is going to be your on and off switch so down for off up for on and on this one and let me bring the other one over to because you guys might be wondering how does this change colors so here is the size difference uh maybe this will work hold on there we go so there is the size difference so this one is a little bit smaller compared to this one right here but each one of these there is a little button here that basically says to hold for five seconds by holding that for five seconds you could actually change the color which is pretty cool which will go dabble that in just a moment as far as how do the helps fill in hand the shoulder one here is definitely pretty light i will say that in terms of the weight there's definitely a little bit more weight added towards the pommel section here so like if i'm holding it like this it would want to fall over this way so the pommel definitely has a bit of weight to it as for the longer one here again this is also feeling pretty light but it's the same as the other one where it seems like a good portion of the weight not a lot by the way is double down towards the pommel section of the health and that's really about it other than that how do these fill in hand these actually feel really good i'm not going to attempt to do any kind of saber moves i can't do any form of moves with two blades in my hand or even just a single i'm more of a double plated lightsaber guy just so you guys know so i'm a little bit biased towards those um but these do feel great in the hand for sure so no complaints whatsoever let me go ahead and close this door and turn off this light so let's see we'll put i have to be kind of careful because this is a pretty long blade and i have kind of a strict uh room here so as always if you've never done one of these before there's a slot on here that's big and small and on the blade itself on these little metal portions that stick out there's a big one and small one all you need to do is just basically align the big with the big small with the ball small and then you push in and you twist to lock it in place it's as simple as that now let me go ahead and bring the other one over because i want to light them up at the same time and again the same thing for this one you light up line up with the big big and small small push in twist to lock it in place as far as how's the locking there is always going to be that little wobble feature it's kind of a built-in feature for these legacy savers but let me try to activate at the same time let me get the on and off switch over here all right so move this little tape i'm sorry i don't want to wake you guys up so let me go ahead and activate in three two one and let's go ahead and activate the small one and i want you guys to listen to the hum really quick because we're gonna notice something pretty cool here let me activate this one so again this is on the green color right now default if you will this is this is the sound it's making now the cool feature is when these are on by the way they have to be on to change the color is that we're going to be holding the button over here the hidden buttons to do the color change and this is where the fun begins a little quilt there so again we're going to go ahead and activate and then i'm gonna go ahead and try to press these at the same time all right so on the count of three i'm gonna press down on these okay one two i mean one two three i'm pressing down wait for it yeah see i wasn't joking about the color change and also you guys notice anything different you notice the hum has changed so let me go ahead and change it back one one two three wait for it [Applause] and then one two three isn't that cool so not only do they change color but they also have it toward the sound changes as well it kind of mixes in with the other one slightly but i think that's pretty cool again disney did a really good job with these ones which is why i'm liking these ones way more than the rebels one now as far as motion goes this one does sound a little bit lower in the volume well this one here definitely sounds a bit lighter uh having these two to side-by-side this one sounds louder than this one for sure so i think that's really really cool so again we'll just go ahead bring it down and then we're just going to go ahead and kind of swap between the different colors just to show again again you just got to hold it for five seconds again one two three five seconds later and we go or if you wanted to you can go ahead and have the other one just change you could go ahead and mix and match actually this one kind of does look like it's got that the way the camera is picking it up kind of looks like it's got that yellowish color tone kind of like in the show maybe that's just my eyes i can't see clearly right now but yeah that's just really darn cool and again you could hear the sound difference again this one has sounds a lot lower so i don't know if that's a common thing or not well this one so i think that's really darn cool so what do you guys think let me know in the comment section down below but let me oh that's the on and off switch i was holding down the on and off which was like why isn't this changing color there we go and now we're going to go ahead and deactivate so yeah overall like i said i think these are great and if you are someone that's looking to add something to your collection and you had to pick between the rebels version or these ones i recommend these ones way more than the rebels one again the rebels one i didn't like because they was chunky uncomfortable and i felt like it could have been a much better job these ones are a lot better it's the same exact price at two hundred dollars these also at the same time can change color so if you're looking for a legacy lightsaber that you can change color with these are the only ones at least at the moment who knows what the future may have actually i'm really kind of curious because if you guys remember there was a a voting thing in terms of what would be become the next legacy lightsaber what do people the fans want to see as a legacy lightsaber and as you guys know the one from jedi fallen order ended up winning and as you guys know when jedi fall in order you could cycle through and customize your lightsaber and change between different colors so if disney follows through like if they're on this path of making things improved then hopefully i'm hoping i don't know if this is going to happen or not but hopefully when that one comes out hopefully you could cycle between different colors more than one because if they do then disney would have nailed it for sure and hopefully the hell isn't too big and bulky again that's the other concern that i have with these things but these ones for sure hands down definitely one of my personal favorite legacy lightsaber hills that they are currently offering on the market again two hundred dollars they change colors they look great they feel great and if you're someone that is a huge fan of the character of ahsoka tano and these are definitely going to be a perfect fit for your collection but let me know what you guys think about this in the comment section down below like i said i'm not going to attempt to go outside because i i can't and i'm being honest as much as i like swinging lightsabers i don't have any skill in swinging these around plus this blade here is a little bit too big for the show to help to begin with but next friday next friday i'll be doing some saber swings with the saber forge dark ray but again i think these are great i wish i had a signed pair i'm jealous of each every each and every person he's got a signed pair for sure but um again i just think it's really cool that ashley the voice of ahsoka has been doing such an amazing job in terms of you know interacting with the community a bit more showing up to the lightsaber meetup as a big surprise and signing so many hilts then it even cost you extra which is just fantastic but again let me know what you guys think about this in the comment section down below until then i look forward to giving you guys my next lightsaber review next friday and one of the other things too i know a lot of you guys were asking me if i got the next gen console so i'm going to do an unboxing video or not um i have the xbox series x i'm waiting to get my hands on the playstation 5 and what i would like to do even though it's not star wars based but i know a lot of people want to hear my thoughts and opinions on these is i'm hoping once i get the playstation 5 and mess with it a bit i would like to do kind of like a first impressions video based on the unboxing experience what i think of the console so far and what is currently available for the system for those who are continuing to be gamers or maybe new gamers coming to the market type thing so hopefully that'll be a future video down the road but until then i'll see you guys in the next video and you guys enjoy your weekend and also may the force be with you", "U6bz8zvO3Ck": "[Music] my friends my friends starwars.com has recently released a series of images and interviews regarding one of the new lightsaber designs that is going to be making an appearance in their high republic series of releases however this lightsaber has some pretty serious flaws that really serve as a microcosm exemplary of everything wrong with their decision to focus so much storytelling on the era of the high republic if you don't know the high republic is an era that takes place 200 years before the events of the phantom menace and will be the focus of a multimedia release including books comics graphic novels and pretty much everything except for visual media so at this point we don't have any confirmed tv shows video games or feature films that said they are focusing pretty heavily on this era and the first story told in this era will be releasing january 2021 but right now we've got a sneak peek at this interesting looking lightsaber and it has some pretty dramatic implications both for the era that they chose and just star wars mythos as a whole so first looking at this lightsaber we can see that is a cross guard design and the actual design of the cross guard is already pretty unique but this one takes that one step further featuring both a bladed cross guard as well as a mechanical or tactile element of the cross guard and we do know both from star wars rebels as well as a slew of visual dictionaries and the like that the crossguard design is one that predates kylo ren by several centuries and while i do love the design of this cross guard it does have some interesting implications that we are going to talk about later first i want to read an excerpt from the team behind this lightsaber the quote reads we wanted to make the jedi distinctive and instantly recognizable as jedi knights of the high republic and that applied not only to their clothing but to their lightsabers as well says michael siglaine lucasfilm publishing's creative director internally we often refer to the jedi of this era as the jedi knights of the round table taking that idea one step further their lightsabers can be viewed as their own versions of excalibur looking at that quote i think that idea really carries over to this lightsaber having a very arthurian feel to it and i again i really like this lightsaber i really want a replica of it it actually kind of reminds me of senya's lightsaber from star wars the old republic as well as the lightsabers used by the eternal empire having that white gold and black kind of look and feel to it and it has those ornate designs on the hilt and along with those mechanical moving parts which is something that we who have played the old republic will immediately associate with the eternal empire the next quote comes from jeff r thomas who is the illustration manager at disney publishing who says when designing stellan's lightsaber i looked at the iconic lightsabers that have already been established we needed an iconic weapon that could stand beside other famous lightsabers but at the same time be unique to him and evoke the time period of the high republic he goes on to say with the high republic we wanted to implement a more traditional cross guard but i still wanted to include the lightsaber blade of the crossguard design so that stellen would be able to defend himself against saber attacks this is where excalibur came into play thomas says what would a lightsaber version of excalibur look like i started sketching and i came up with a silhouette that i really liked but the practicality of holstering slash sheathing it nagged at me until i had the idea that the cross guard didn't have to be stationary perhaps it could activate or deactivate with the saber so after some more sketches and some time going back and forth with lucasfilm it was decided that the cross guard would activate as opposed to always being open which would allow the saber a slimmer silhouette well holstered and would lend itself to some great visuals when activating they also released some concept art of it both activated as well as sheath and we can see that the sheath is very different from the lightsaber uh just the standard covertec or even d-ring clips used in the original and prequel trilogy and it does have that very nightly feel of a scabbard almost or at least the descending leather or cloth straps that would attach to the scabbard so you may be thinking it sounds like i really love this design so what is my big problem with it well as i mentioned earlier the crossguard design was incredibly popular centuries before the existence of kylo ren being a much older design however much like the curved lightsaber hilt the crossguard lightsaber fell out of favor primarily due to the lack of lightsaber wielding opponents the crossguard and the curved hilt are both sub-optimal for deflecting against blaster shots and so in an era where blaster wielding enemies would have been the most common opponent of the jedi knights the cross guard actually becomes a little bit more of a hindrance than a help we even see here in the article that he included the blade so that he could fight against lightsaber wielding opponents but this is a problem because the high republic era really isn't that long before the phantom menace while 200 years might sound like a long time when we're talking about star wars with a 20 000 year history or really 25 000 years 200 is nothing more than a blip and not that much should have actually changed between the era of the high republic and the era of the prequels especially considering how slow technology changes in the star wars universe adding to that there were no lightsaber-wielding opponents during the era 200 years before the phantom menace it's unthinkable there hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the republic i will not let this republic that has stood for a thousand years be splitting too we know that the last time that the jedi went toe-to-toe with lightsaber wielding opponents was roughly one thousand years before the phantom menace not two hundred impossible the sith have been extinct for a millennium that still would have been 800 years before the use of this lightsaber and so it does really make me question the decision to put this lightsaber here it really feels like they just wanted to dive straight into that nightly format and just put this whole thing in the wrong era i actually think that the high republic could have been really good i mean it still might be it hasn't come out i can't judge that yet but i think that it would have certainly been better if they had placed it an era where they could have been going toe to toe with sith or at least other lightsaber wielding opponents i mean i suppose they could be going toe-to-toe with dark jedi which the difference in a dark jedi and a sith is pretty much just a jedi who went to the dark side but hasn't embraced the sith teaching or more specifically has not had sith mentorship but even still it does feel like a waste to put all of these really cool arthurian stories in an era that is the the golden era of the republic this is an era of unparalleled peace the jedi are doing their job and there aren't a lot of major threats to the galaxy now we know that there are going to be some threats that look like they're going to function a little bit more like genghis khan but still it doesn't really fit if i'm being totally honest in short this changes a lot of what we had previously assumed about the cross guard lightsaber namely that it would have fallen out of practice i would have assumed around 900 years before the phantom menace not 200 years that would have made a lot more sense to me being that would have been enough time for the jedi to realize that they weren't fighting against other lightsaber wielding opponents and were primarily dealing with opponents with blasters and it would have been more prudent to use a standard straight blade straight hilt lightsaber since that you can more deftly manipulate to make contact and redirect blaster bolts and not needing to go toe-to-toe with other people wielding lightsabers or even bladed weapons the cross guard and the curved hilt would have likely fell out of practice i would have assumed around the same time now yes there can be outliers we know for instance that dooku built a curved lightsaber because he believed that the sith would return and he wanted to be prepared to do combat against them so again his lightsaber was built because he anticipated lightsaber to lightsaber combat and so that makes me really curious about this cross-guarded lightsaber in short i've already said this but it really feels like the high republic should have been set in the old republic that would have given the authors and the writers the freedom to tell stories about a multitude of jedi going against a multitude of sith but despite the fact that there is almost nothing defined in the era between the last great battle of the sith and the phantom menace that doesn't change the fact that this era is incredibly restrictive since we know that they cannot openly go to war with lightsaber wielding opponents this is a really interesting lightsaber design and i just can't help as much as i feel like this hurts the lore or at least backs them into a corner in regards to the lore i just really like that this lightsaber exists i think that the idea of an excalibur lightsaber is just one of the coolest things i've ever seen and i really cannot wait until someone does a replica of this because you know i'm going to buy it the lightsaber has that like red button which is emblematic of the prequels and it has that white gold and black which really reminds me of the eternal empire let me know what you guys think of this lightsaber let me know what you guys think about the lore and their decision to put this new era of storytelling in an era that i think is incredibly restrictive do you think it's as restrictive as i do or do you like that we're touching on an era that we haven't really seen explore before let me know what you think down in the comments below because as always i want to know what you my friends have to say about our favorite galaxy far far away thank you all so much for watching don't forget to like and subscribe or if you learned absolutely nothing new feel free to leave a thumbs down absolutely guilt-free because that tells me i'm not doing my job thank you all so much for watching and as always may the lore be with you now and forever", "iuNjDzT6PWo": "Good morning, well or good whatever time of day\u00a0\nit is for you where you happen to be right now.\u00a0\u00a0 A few weeks ago I did a show and tell\u00a0\nof the lightsaber that i built uh\u00a0\u00a0 back in the mid 90s after traveling to the\u00a0\nlucasfilm behind the myths exhibition at\u00a0\u00a0 yerba buena arts center here in san francisco uh\u00a0\ni took a snapshot of this made some measurements\u00a0\u00a0 and built this on lunch hours while working for\u00a0\njamie heinemann in commercial special effects\u00a0\u00a0 in the comments of that video a lot of you\u00a0\nasked and requested that i show myself building\u00a0\u00a0 a lightsaber like that from scratch which i\u00a0\nthink is a terrific idea and i'm totally going\u00a0\u00a0 to do it but i'm going to uh i'm going to walk\u00a0\nyou through the story and i'm going to build\u00a0\u00a0 it as if i had to build it today with similar\u00a0\nresources like i have reference material for\u00a0\u00a0 the actual luke's lightsaber that is perfect\u00a0\nbut i'm not going to use it i'm actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to show you how i would do this if\u00a0\ni didn't have access to enough information\u00a0\u00a0 the first thing you should know is that back in\u00a0\n1995 while working for jamie i was making like\u00a0\u00a0 yeah i wasn't making very much money and so for me\u00a0\nto go get a 35 chunk of aluminum was significant\u00a0\u00a0 like that was a significant expense to me i had to\u00a0\nthink about it and like talk to my then girlfriend\u00a0\u00a0 about it and like save up for it and so when\u00a0\ni did i wanted to be really really careful uh\u00a0\u00a0 this was like a a holy prize when i realized oh\u00a0\nyou know what i think i'm gonna go get a piece\u00a0\u00a0 of aluminum and make a lightsaber and so then\u00a0\ni went down to bay shore metals and i looked\u00a0\u00a0 at their scrap pile and i found a piece just like\u00a0\nthis about two inches in diameter this is standard\u00a0\u00a0 6061 aircraft aluminum um and yeah it was like 35\u00a0\nbucks and i just remember that really that expense\u00a0\u00a0 really kicking my butt back then so uh i wanted\u00a0\nto get this right so uh what i'm gonna do is i'm\u00a0\u00a0 gonna walk you through my computer mechanicians\u00a0\nfor doing a build like this i'm gonna find a\u00a0\u00a0 picture of luke's lightsaber i am going to isolate\u00a0\nit and blow it up but i'm going to try doing this\u00a0\u00a0 without using any special software let's see let's\u00a0\nsee how i do let's see how we do let's get into it first things first is yeah that's my baby yoda\u00a0\nwhat of it he's helping out today uh let's see\u00a0\u00a0 here first things first is luke's light saber um\u00a0\ngreat okay this look i mean it's it's a bonus yeah\u00a0\u00a0 here is an auction photo of luke's lightsaber there we go that that's fantastic that\u00a0\nis exactly the kind of reference we want\u00a0\u00a0 all right so uh i'm gonna\u00a0\nsave this image to my desktop\u00a0\u00a0 and then uh i'm going to use apple's\u00a0\npreview their you know preview is a photo\u00a0\u00a0 viewing program they have oh are you really not\u00a0\ngoing to let me save this image save image as no okay all right here's a trick\u00a0\u00a0 there are websites that won't let you save photos\u00a0\noff the website what you can do is you can go to\u00a0\u00a0 view and uh at least in google chrome for the mac\u00a0\nyou can go to view scroll down the view menu to\u00a0\u00a0 developer and go to view source then look at the\u00a0\nsource and what you're looking for is find luke luke yep loot lightsaber there we go in\u00a0\nthe source code you can find the link\u00a0\u00a0 to the picture without the web mechanisms that\u00a0\nkeep you from being able to download it yeah\u00a0\u00a0 this doesn't take too long seriously it's\u00a0\na great little technique um save image as\u00a0\u00a0 okay or desktop so here's what i'm\u00a0\ngoing to do i'm going to print this out i'm going to print this out onto paper and yeah\u00a0\nso i kind of got that working and i'm not sure\u00a0\u00a0 exactly how uh this is a tutorial at making\u00a0\nnot in web resource management my apologies um it's confusing sometimes it can be look\u00a0\nthis is one of my difficulties with with\u00a0\u00a0 uh with pinterest is being able to save good high\u00a0\nresolution images off of stuff they don't make it\u00a0\u00a0 simple so i frequently do my google searches with\u00a0\na minus sign and pinterest so it doesn't include\u00a0\u00a0 them in the mix because i find them so annoying\u00a0\nsorry pinterest you're fine for assembling\u00a0\u00a0 groups of stuff but when it comes to the kind of\u00a0\nresearch i do you're you're often anti-helpful\u00a0\u00a0 uh okay so i'm gonna print this out print uh\u00a0\non my uh on my print oh i think i printed it to\u00a0\u00a0 the printer at my house hold on yeah that's the\u00a0\none i want okay i'm gonna go get the print out okay i have my lightsaber printed out i don't\u00a0\nthink it's the right size and sure enough it's\u00a0\u00a0 not um i need to get this the right size so how\u00a0\ndo i do that well here's what i ah okay so uh here's where we're hoping to get to we're hoping\u00a0\nto get to a printout that shows precisely how long\u00a0\u00a0 the lightsaber is and luckily for\u00a0\nus on auction sites they often list\u00a0\u00a0 some critical dimensions and i think those are\u00a0\nfairly safe to follow for a reasonable amount of\u00a0\u00a0 accuracy obviously you know some conservator is\u00a0\njust gonna go oh okay this lightsaber is 11.75\u00a0\u00a0 inches long that's totally reasonable it might\u00a0\nactually be 11.76235 inches long that's the kind\u00a0\u00a0 of thing a conservator is not going to worry about\u00a0\nas much as a prop replicator sometimes but we have\u00a0\u00a0 a measurement so we know that we want this to\u00a0\nbe 11.75 inches long and it's currently only 10 inches long how are we going to translate those\u00a0\ntwo things to get them to give us numbers we need\u00a0\u00a0 i'm glad you asked we're gonna do\u00a0\na little math here uh on my channel\u00a0\u00a0 so the actual dimension is 11.75 and the\u00a0\ndimension that we currently have is 10 inches\u00a0\u00a0 so we need to blow this up by a certain percentage\u00a0\u00a0 to do we need to this is 10 inches long\u00a0\nand we need to blow it up by a certain\u00a0\u00a0 percentage to get to 11.75 well this math is\u00a0\nreally easy 11.75 divided by 10 equals 1.175\u00a0\u00a0 that is a hundred and seventeen and a half percent\u00a0\none one seven percent if i multiply ten inches by 117.5 you see how the number works\u00a0\nit's actually pretty straight forward\u00a0\u00a0 okay how can this be how can this formula help you\u00a0\nin your day-to-day life of proper application i'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to give you this simple formula um when you\u00a0\nwant to scale up in a single dimension let's say\u00a0\u00a0 you want to scale from 10 inches up to 11.75 you\u00a0\nsimply take the bigger number and divide it by\u00a0\u00a0 the smaller number that's when you want to scale\u00a0\nup so 11.75 divided by 10 equals 117 and a half\u00a0\u00a0 percent when you want to scale down you take the\u00a0\nsmaller number and divide it by the bigger number\u00a0\u00a0 you do the reverse operation and so for instance\u00a0\nfor if you wanted to take something that was 11.75\u00a0\u00a0 inches and divided by 10 inches you would get\u00a0\nwhen you divide 10 by 11.75 you get 85 percent\u00a0\u00a0 this is a technique i used hundreds of times a day\u00a0\nas a graphic designer back in new york in the 80s\u00a0\u00a0 where that was before we had computers we did\u00a0\neverything by hand and that kind of scaling i did\u00a0\u00a0 constantly constantly so what i'm\u00a0\ngoing to do is i'm going to take\u00a0\u00a0 this over to my printer and use its sizing\u00a0\nfunction to blow this up into two parts\u00a0\u00a0 i am back from the printer and i have my\u00a0\nlightsaber in two pages so uh this is now 11.75\u00a0\u00a0 inches in dimension you can see it's nice and\u00a0\nclose to my lightsaber um a note what i've done\u00a0\u00a0 here is called tiling because eight and a half by\u00a0\n11 sheets of paper aren't big enough for an 11.75\u00a0\u00a0 inch long thing and i tile a lot but it's bizarre\u00a0\nto me that it's still really really difficult for\u00a0\u00a0 instance on the mac i might be different on a\u00a0\npc but on the mac if i wanted to tile something\u00a0\u00a0 up to like full size me i have trouble i still\u00a0\nhave trouble finding a program that can take an\u00a0\u00a0 image and let me say blow this up to 72 inches\u00a0\nlong and then divide it out into sheets of eight\u00a0\u00a0 and a half by 11 paper i can print out i still\u00a0\nhave to kind of manually do that in photoshop\u00a0\u00a0 which seems crazy to me i know you're saying why\u00a0\ndon't you learn how to code and write your own\u00a0\u00a0 software i have chosen a different path in life\u00a0\ni am suggesting this right now so that somebody\u00a0\u00a0 else maybe tells me about the right tiling program\u00a0\nto make big posters because i haven't found it and\u00a0\u00a0 it drives me nuts i can't believe in this day\u00a0\nand age this is such a simple thing this should\u00a0\u00a0 literally be a print function in every print\u00a0\ndialogue how big do you want it i want it this\u00a0\u00a0 big it might take 400 sheets of paper yes that's\u00a0\nwhat i want please give me this functionality okay\u00a0\u00a0 i am that's the end of my rant i'm gonna tape\u00a0\nthis together i'm gonna cut off this end tape\u00a0\u00a0 it together with scotch tape and start to make\u00a0\nsome critical measurements off of it uh i have a\u00a0\u00a0 piece of aluminum that is perfect for it it is two\u00a0\ninches in diameter um that is the tiniest shade\u00a0\u00a0 too small for the edge of the emitter here but\u00a0\nthis is what i was working with back in 1994\u00a0\u00a0 95 and that's what i'm going to work with today\u00a0\nmy emitter will be slightly smaller than normal i cut this on a diagonal because\u00a0\nit makes it easier to find line this by the way doing this this is such a classic\u00a0\nuh assistant animator in between move so on\u00a0\u00a0 animation they'll often draw the first pass of the\u00a0\nanimation on what's called fours they'll draw one\u00a0\u00a0 keyframe every four frames and then the assistant\u00a0\nanimator's job is to go in and draw the frame in\u00a0\u00a0 between each frame and i used to do that\u00a0\nand you would do lots of this this lot a b\u00a0\u00a0 testing of your drawing back and forth back and\u00a0\nforth yeah super low res worked every time okay great okay okay so there is our lightsaber look\u00a0\nat that this is almost exactly what i\u00a0\u00a0 was working with way back then this piece of\u00a0\naluminum is freaking just barely long enough\u00a0\u00a0 wow i wish i had a slightly longer piece but i\u00a0\ndo not okay so what am i gonna do here i think i could do a cover of the bottom\u00a0\nof that so i could i could mill yeah okay i think i could\u00a0\nmill the back half of this\u00a0\u00a0 while i can still hold on to this nice and\u00a0\ntight and then put an expanding collet in there\u00a0\u00a0 and then cover that with a cover plate\u00a0\ni think that's what i'm gonna do i'm\u00a0\u00a0 not gonna make that out of copper i'm\u00a0\njust gonna mill this monolithically okay uh one of the issues i'm gonna deal with\u00a0\nhere or i'm actually not going to deal with\u00a0\u00a0 is called parallaxing and that is um this\u00a0\nisn't a perfect plan view of the lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 because the camera was in the middle at some\u00a0\ndistance away probably on a lens like a 50 or a\u00a0\u00a0 70 millimeter lens um but you can see that\u00a0\ni can see kind of that at this end i can see\u00a0\u00a0 sort of under the transmitter and at this\u00a0\nend i can see under the hand wheel here so\u00a0\u00a0 i'm getting some parallaxing that means that these\u00a0\ndimensions aren't going to be perfectly accurate\u00a0\u00a0 that's okay that's that's kind of what we have\u00a0\nto deal with sometimes and that's for real you\u00a0\u00a0 know that's just like you can't really escape\u00a0\nparallaxing you just got to be able to accommodate\u00a0\u00a0 for it i'm not going to worry about it here i'm\u00a0\njust going to assume that these dimensions all the\u00a0\u00a0 way down are just gospel all right i think i have\u00a0\na i think i have a rough plan for how to obtain\u00a0\u00a0 this out of this it's going to take a couple\u00a0\nsteps because if i had my druthers i'd have\u00a0\u00a0 another couple of inches on this so i'd have\u00a0\na more positive grab it means i'll have to\u00a0\u00a0 adjust this a couple of times during the lathing\u00a0\nprocess and there will be a milling operation\u00a0\u00a0 but it should be pretty\u00a0\nstraightforward let's find out there's that i'm going to grab this oh actually\u00a0\nright i've got a two inch center cool so uh\u00a0\u00a0 i am going to start milling off the back side here\u00a0\nand the first dimension i want is this dimension\u00a0\u00a0 what is the outer dimension of these eight\u00a0\nuh crenellations on the end of the lightsaber and there's answer to that question the answer is 1.88 inches please don't take any of these\u00a0\ndimensions as actual canon star wars dimensions\u00a0\u00a0 i'm getting this wrong in some small\u00a0\nways i hope i've made that really clear\u00a0\u00a0 it's just me doing this as if i was doing\u00a0\nit back in 1995 working with the drawings\u00a0\u00a0 so 1.88 inches and this is currently\u00a0\nexactly 2 inches yup to the to the 1000th good speed all right i'm going to zero out my dro and we get a dimension just peel\u00a0\noff a little bit yeah that is\u00a0\u00a0 so that's perfect now when i want 1.88 minus 1.88 equals 0.12 about an eighth of an\u00a0\ninch i'm peeling off of this um in general 120\u00a0\u00a0 is a lot to pull off of a uh there's a lot to\u00a0\ntake off of a piece of aluminum in your lathe i\u00a0\u00a0 try and do about 30 30 40 000 at a clip so 0.12\u00a0\nwill go to 0.04 we'll say 035 let's try that\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah i'm just trying to get past yeah i'm\u00a0\njust trying to get past there really right yeah once i get past that where the hand wheel is\u00a0\u00a0 i don't need much more so\u00a0\ni can just go right there i could there we go i can make\u00a0\nthat mark 35 let's just see how it he really likes that awesome okay another 35. another 35. now i want to go to uh 0.12 so we're going to\u00a0\ntake my dro to that critical dimension we go\u00a0\u00a0 and now i'm going to use the um the\u00a0\nauto feed because it'll give me a give me chatter is what it's giving me what the\u00a0\nhell oh right i'm not pulling up some of these\u00a0\u00a0 bits have a certain amount they like to remove\u00a0\nand if you pull off less you get chad that's funny\u00a0\u00a0 that's okay we can uh file\u00a0\nthat off later with late marks okay now i'd like to um let's just see what i\u00a0\ngot there let me get to one time look at that 1.88 a little bit higher 1.888 so uh i'm eight\u00a0\nthou over which is fine it's kind of exactly where\u00a0\u00a0 i'd like to be i sort of make some of my small\u00a0\nadjustments here based on giving myself a little\u00a0\u00a0 room to move the next thing i want to do is create\u00a0\nthe ability to grab this from the inside i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to drill a hole in the end uh first i'm going to\u00a0\ndrill this a little bit long no i don't think so\u00a0\u00a0 but i want to pull it down to\u00a0\na dimension of 1.375 and 0.4 in\u00a0\u00a0 so i want to level the end first\u00a0\nthat's that's the next step nice now i'm going to drill a hole\u00a0\nin the middle but i'm going to give myself a center drill okay so that is uh that is four tenths four\u00a0\nyeah that's four tenths of an inch deep\u00a0\u00a0 that is one point two eight seven\u00a0\nfive in diameter now what we have\u00a0\u00a0 here is we've got these angles so what are these\u00a0\nangles and this is one of the reason i love these\u00a0\u00a0 specific elorus universal bits because i can\u00a0\nuse them to set angles that i want and i do this\u00a0\u00a0 pretty much visually i know that's not necessarily\u00a0\nthe exact right way to do it but what the hell it works for this kind of stuff so i'm going to\u00a0\nloosen this and i'm going to get this angle set\u00a0\u00a0 see the other thing is that if you think\u00a0\nlike a prop maker you'll notice hey look\u00a0\u00a0 the angle matches the standard angle that i\u00a0\ncan reach with the dolores universal tool bit\u00a0\u00a0 given that i learned about these tool bits at\u00a0\nindustrial light magic it would seem to follow\u00a0\u00a0 that they're using the same thing to make\u00a0\nthe same cut so that's what we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0 do we're gonna come in here and we're\u00a0\ngonna soften this shoulder at this angle there we go now we're going to soften the other\u00a0\nside of that shoulder doing a similar thing i think that's the right measurement let me just\u00a0\ndouble check oh right that's how i was doing it\u00a0\u00a0 no that's one less damn close enough for me\u00a0\nnow the question is how wide is that little\u00a0\u00a0 so you know what i probably want to do i\u00a0\nprobably want to go in a little farther maybe\u00a0\u00a0 i want to pull this piece out a little bit and\u00a0\nand machine from here from here across getting\u00a0\u00a0 that critical dimension because once i have\u00a0\nthat then i can go in and get that shoulder now i'm going to pull out my other universal\u00a0\nbit leave that one there and let's see things are going well i've got the back section\u00a0\nroughed out here i'm about to and i've got a a a a\u00a0\u00a0 live center here stuck into the end and i'm about\u00a0\nto plane down or lay down most of this material\u00a0\u00a0 here it's going to be a bunch of auto feeding\u00a0\nand then i'm going to get in towards making the\u00a0\u00a0 all the rest of these uh all the rest of those\u00a0\ndetails up here on my thumb side of the saber\u00a0\u00a0 later we'll figure out how to actually\u00a0\ncut the eight crenellations in the\u00a0\u00a0 hand wheel here famously the original\u00a0\nlightsaber this was a faucet knob\u00a0\u00a0 uh i don't have access to such a thing\u00a0\nso i'm gonna have to machine it but\u00a0\u00a0 for right now here's some soothing time lapses\u00a0\nof removing lots of material on the lathe i screwed up again uh for the like the fourth\u00a0\ntime i really i really messed this up i i grrrr here is what happened here is the lightsaber\u00a0\nthat i'm trying to build and uh i've made\u00a0\u00a0 several mistakes about not paying attention\u00a0\num one of them was out at the emitter i cut\u00a0\u00a0 a little too much material off here so i was\u00a0\ngoing to have to make the emitter a separate part\u00a0\u00a0 but now what i did was i messed up this part\u00a0\nhere because well you might even be able to\u00a0\u00a0 see it on the time lapse but i couldn't see it\u00a0\nbut part of my tool holder was i hadn't set up\u00a0\u00a0 my orientations correctly and measurements started\u00a0\nchanging and i didn't realize they were changing\u00a0\u00a0 because i was forcing the wrong part of the\u00a0\nmill the lathe into the material i was ending up how many how many i just i totally screwed it up\u00a0\nso i have a choice i can uh order a new piece of\u00a0\u00a0 two inch i can order a new piece of some\u00a0\ntwo-inch rod it's a new two-inch aluminum\u00a0\u00a0 6061 and start this from scratch in a few days or\u00a0\ni can muscle through and adjust to what's happened i think that's what i'm gonna do so i think\u00a0\nthat what i'm going to end up doing here is there are some salvageable pieces of this build\u00a0\nright now i'm going to cut those salvageable\u00a0\u00a0 pieces off i'm going to tap them so that i\u00a0\ncan connect them later with bits of all thread\u00a0\u00a0 i have this other bit of two inch rod which should\u00a0\nuh afford me enough material to finish this today\u00a0\u00a0 i was really hope here's the problem i was hoping\u00a0\ni would finish this in the first half of the day\u00a0\u00a0 and get another one-day build done today i there's\u00a0\nno need there's no need i could do it tomorrow but\u00a0\u00a0 i started counting my money and it's not\u00a0\nlike i'm making money it's not like i\u00a0\u00a0 i don't mean actually counting the money i mean\u00a0\nlike when you're at the poker table and you get\u00a0\u00a0 a good hand and you start counting your money\u00a0\nthat's when you're about to lose because you\u00a0\u00a0 are not paying attention to everyone else in\u00a0\nthe room that's what happened to me here i was\u00a0\u00a0 counting my money i was like oh we're gonna\u00a0\nget this done fast it's gonna be fast cause i had my eye on the wrong ball\u00a0\u00a0 okay let's salvage what we've got and\u00a0\nmake something better shall we okay okay uh that wasn't as bad as i thought i\u00a0\nhave now the better part of a lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 with a removable bottom and that actually makes\u00a0\nthis an easier task because what i've got to do\u00a0\u00a0 is create the correct hand wheel\u00a0\ncrenellations in the back of this\u00a0\u00a0 so it's time to move over to the mill briefly\u00a0\ni love the smell of freshly machined aluminum\u00a0\u00a0 um it's coming along nicely yeah i'm quite uh\u00a0\ni'm provisionally pleased let's not get ahead of\u00a0\u00a0 ourselves so i need to machine eight crenellations\u00a0\noff of this which is four on the cardinal points\u00a0\u00a0 and four on the halfway splits of cardinal points\u00a0\nso every 45 degrees i could pull out a a a rotary\u00a0\u00a0 head that i've got with a center and set this up\u00a0\nto do that but that is a lot of work and i have an\u00a0\u00a0 easier way to do it which is to use what's called\u00a0\na collet block this is a collet block and i can\u00a0\u00a0 actually wait right there since i've got the\u00a0\n3 8 bolt sticking out of here i've got a 3 8 5\u00a0\u00a0 c collet i stick that in there i stick this in\u00a0\nthe collet block and i can tighten it down hang on\u00a0\u00a0 come on cooperate there you go that's what i\u00a0\nwanted so i can tighten this down and then i\u00a0\u00a0 can chuck this into my mill and i can get one two\u00a0\nthree four because i can just turn it for each\u00a0\u00a0 operation then if i carefully turn this exactly 45\u00a0\ndegrees and i'm pretty sure i can get there close\u00a0\u00a0 enough by eye and some various measuring\u00a0\ntools i have around here then i make four\u00a0\u00a0 more cuts and i believe that's how i did the\u00a0\nfirst the original one that i did we shall see i didn't think through the forces involved i\u00a0\ndidn't think through the forces involved that's\u00a0\u00a0 what i didn't do i had uh this little 3 8 bolt\u00a0\nchucked in here felt like really tight but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 gonna hit it with an end mill that's carving\u00a0\noff material it just made the whole thing spin so uh this will be a mar i i can clean that up\u00a0\na little later i can i can i can i can clean\u00a0\u00a0 that but still the question remains how to\u00a0\nmount this how do i mount how do i work this\u00a0\u00a0 you may ask yourself where is that beautiful\u00a0\nhouse you may ask yourself where does that highway\u00a0\u00a0 lead to my gosh i was watching um david byrne\u00a0\nthe other day oh my gosh his new concert film\u00a0\u00a0 directed by spike lee dude it's amazing david\u00a0\nbyrne just one of my heroes let's see here all right that was lame in the stream i'm unhappy i guess i could v block this and\u00a0\ncertainly that gives me more encryption i'm gonna have to redo the center oh sorry no center i mean i guess i could do\u00a0\nlayout on this piece here\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah that'll be good enough i\u00a0\nthat has to have been how i did it\u00a0\u00a0 before i'm going to do some layout here of\u00a0\nthe of the points that i need yeah and um let me use some vertical squares to get myself\u00a0\nto the right orientation okay to the workbench that is a good canvas uh i suppose let's get the marking fluid oh oops i thought this was going to be\u00a0\na super fast build and that's\u00a0\u00a0 why i got boned that's why i'm ending\u00a0\nup in this position because again i'm i'm trying to rush through such such my bellywick trying to rush through things this is the point in which i would say to\u00a0\ngunther or joey maybe just leave me alone for half\u00a0\u00a0 an hour this is the point this is that exact point\u00a0\nand they would be like okay and they would back\u00a0\u00a0 away but here we are all the warts and warts and\u00a0\nall so uh let me just get this guy held in here come on over and take a look excellent there's\u00a0\nmy center finder i gotta find my scribes all right there's my scribe there you are\u00a0\nhello sweetie it's good to see you again there's my scribe so we are going to scribe a line\u00a0\nacross now we're going to scribe a line up but\u00a0\u00a0 how we're going to make sure that it's perfectly\u00a0\nsquare that's a really excellent question\u00a0\u00a0 well i suppose yeah that's the thing\u00a0\nto it all right there we go okay let's good now that you're in position\u00a0\nthis and its right orientation great now i have the four cardinal\u00a0\npoints i need the others so now i need i need a 45. i suppose i can draw a line here and split\u00a0\nit that's not as accurate as i would like\u00a0\u00a0 but if i get that right right slightly newer calipers on this we're talking plus or minus like a few thou on this it's an aesthetic thing 0.95\u00a0\u00a0 so half of 0.95 is 0.475 is that right 0.95\u00a0\ndivided by 2 equals 0.475 hey i can do math sometimes okay so that see how i like that that is\u00a0\nfreaking close let's see what i can get from that see how it all looks i'm gonna do the same right angle\u00a0\nfor these as i did on the first one hey i really appreciate all the advice\u00a0\nyou folks are currently giving me in the\u00a0\u00a0 comments even though that's in the future\u00a0\nfrom now about better ways to do this that looks damn good i'm i think i can\u00a0\ni think i can work with that that is\u00a0\u00a0 within a degree or two of exactly 45 degree\u00a0\nincrements all the way around the 360. so find the center again start milling\u00a0\nand then after i mill it all get this\u00a0\u00a0 on the lathe and fix that dumb chatter\u00a0\ngrrrrr here we go really nice and exact\u00a0\u00a0 yes i like that so i'm going to call that we are in let's get back our edge finder and i'm going to use the edge finder here on my\u00a0\nv blocks because i'll get a more better reading okay redo the edge here we go i see the problem for you yeah that dimension dead smack center of\u00a0\nthat no matter how much i move this this way\u00a0\u00a0 it's still going to be centered this way which\u00a0\nis exactly what i wanted so let's find her\u00a0\u00a0 go home don't you want to go home i'm going\u00a0\nto use my 5 16. hey okay so that's a really\u00a0\u00a0 bad thing to do with a square the thing i just\u00a0\ndid and luckily it fell on a wooden floor but how much should i trust that let's see here i'm behind the camera right\u00a0\nnow i happen to be on my\u00a0\u00a0 soap stone surface plate and i'm just\u00a0\nchecking square yeah that's good enough\u00a0\u00a0 double check this guy i'm sure i like\u00a0\nhis position i do i do i do so he's in now we're gonna bring this down\u00a0\nright i'm gonna bring the nut up and i'm just going to bring it all the way\u00a0\nthrough is that what i'm really going to\u00a0\u00a0 do yeah this is exactly what i'm going\u00a0\nto bring it all the way through um yeah the first cut is away that's all next cut i think we could do this at time lapse don't you well this has been a journey uh so\u00a0\u00a0 let's just talk about where i started i started\u00a0\nby grabbing an auction photo of luke's lightsaber\u00a0\u00a0 here and using it as a plan view\u00a0\nfor how big this thing should be um and for reference in 1994 i made this on lunch\u00a0\nhours in jamie's shop from uh uh uh snappy\u00a0\u00a0 pictures of of uh the self-same lightsaber okay\u00a0\nliterally from like a disposable camera's pictures\u00a0\u00a0 of a self-same lifesaver here is where i've\u00a0\ngotten thus far and it's pretty good it's way off\u00a0\u00a0 and that is i i i guess this was the\u00a0\nexercise that demonstrates how far off\u00a0\u00a0 one can get and frankly i'm part of\u00a0\nme wants to keep grinding away at this\u00a0\u00a0 but um i'm gonna have to let\u00a0\nthis one go uh because okay um\u00a0\u00a0 this just is actually less accurate to me it's\u00a0\nless correct looking in its current state i know\u00a0\u00a0 i have to slice that off but and i will it's less\u00a0\ncorrect looking than than the one i made in 94.\u00a0\u00a0 and and maybe that's the thing is like i\u00a0\nknow just enough to be dangerous but and and like i definitely don't want to disappoint\u00a0\nyou the audience i wanted to have like made a\u00a0\u00a0 perfect lightsaber and be like\u00a0\nyeah i nailed it but i didn't for the record this is a perfect lightsaber this\u00a0\nis an exact measured copy of what this of what\u00a0\u00a0 this is okay here's the thing take a look at how\u00a0\ndifferent it is oh yeah look look look okay so\u00a0\u00a0 oh maybe you can't see it fascinating on\u00a0\ncamera it looks dead accurate but in fact\u00a0\u00a0 if i line up the tops the bottoms are off by\u00a0\nlike three quarters of an inch that's where\u00a0\u00a0 we're talking about parallaxing right those look\u00a0\nlike side by side like great but they're not no\u00a0\u00a0 this is it's not correct so um when i hold my 1994\u00a0\noriginal up to this you can see the ways in which\u00a0\u00a0 it's longer so clearly i was working\u00a0\nwith a similar kind of parallaxing\u00a0\u00a0 all the topological details are there as i\u00a0\nstated and then in the one that i've built today\u00a0\u00a0 um also longer so in fact what i find the\u00a0\nmost interesting part of this exercise is that these guys are pretty\u00a0\nfreaking close like these guys\u00a0\u00a0 and they're way closer than they ought to be\u00a0\nand that actually follows because i was working\u00a0\u00a0 with the same kind of reference material a single\u00a0\nphotograph which again because of lens distortion\u00a0\u00a0 right it's a flat object photographed by a\u00a0\nspherical lens so you're getting this kind of\u00a0\u00a0 wrap here and that means that\u00a0\nall sorts of dimensions change\u00a0\u00a0 even from here to here this is only a few inches\u00a0\nfour or five inches and yet dimensions can change\u00a0\u00a0 when you're dealing with the sphericity of\u00a0\nthe lens that you're taking the picture of let's take this all the way to its end and call\u00a0\nit and it is not the build i was hoping to have\u00a0\u00a0 gotten done today it is less a terrific lightsaber\u00a0\nthan i was hoping but i mean part of one of the\u00a0\u00a0 reasons i gotta let this one go is because i got\u00a0\nall the lightsabers i i have all of my favorite\u00a0\u00a0 lightsabers and i'm really happy with them and\u00a0\nthis isn't like there is no line standing between\u00a0\u00a0 me and the perfect lightsaber in my life because\u00a0\ni i have them i have a shelf full of them so i'm\u00a0\u00a0 totally cool so this one is going to be the the\u00a0\nobject lesson in the errors that can be introduced\u00a0\u00a0 from the reference material i didn't think\u00a0\nthat was what this build was going to be about\u00a0\u00a0 and yet that's what it's about the ocds among\u00a0\nus are just going to have to let this one lie\u00a0\u00a0 okay so let's cut off this tip and we will chuck\u00a0\nthis into the lathe again and then we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 do uh some steel wool on it then we're going to\u00a0\ndo a final polish and then we'll throw a little\u00a0\u00a0 spray paint on there and we'll call this one i\u00a0\nam not going to make the um the activation box\u00a0\u00a0 on this it's a whole another it's a whole nother\u00a0\npersuasion that i'm not going to get to today um you know i think that's what's going to happen is\u00a0\nthis is going to make me better at interpreting\u00a0\u00a0 photographic data later down the line i will be\u00a0\nable to understand more because i've never done\u00a0\u00a0 a kind of an a b testing like this okay enough\u00a0\nof my chatter let's get back to the machines so there there's the drawing i started with\u00a0\nthere's the lightsaber i made from the drawing here is the lightsaber that i made in 1994 and is the lightsaber that is\u00a0\nall of the correct dimensions yeah a lot of different things going on\u00a0\nlots lots of different things going on per usual the build i thought would be an easy\u00a0\u00a0 quick and dirty turned out to be\u00a0\nlong and just a little bit brutal um\u00a0\u00a0 i i certainly could have done better but\u00a0\nwe're going to leave it like that that's um\u00a0\u00a0 however the lessons learned are the lessons\u00a0\nlearned i appreciate you guys joining me for this\u00a0\u00a0 one day build here's what i'm going to do in the\u00a0\nnext few months uh i am going to build myself a\u00a0\u00a0 personal lightsaber i have built enough of canon\u00a0\nlightsabers it's time for me to build one for me\u00a0\u00a0 my design my electronics well i mean you know\u00a0\ni'll purchase electronics kit and a blade\u00a0\u00a0 kit and all that uh but i will machine\u00a0\nthe the body of this thing to my specs\u00a0\u00a0 because i think that's what was missing today\u00a0\ni think i was like kind of doing a demo but i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't have enough skin in the game to get it\u00a0\nacross the line in this way that i wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 so i had to realize that a demo was not what\u00a0\ni was making it was more like a lesson and\u00a0\u00a0 well you know another one of my lessons\u00a0\nin that less than perfect outcomes however\u00a0\u00a0 uh a lot of information was gleaned today\u00a0\nthat that's that's how i'm gonna call it\u00a0\u00a0 thank you guys so much for joining me for this\u00a0\none day build these are cut these are the kind of\u00a0\u00a0 days that happen in every shop and i will see you\u00a0\nguys next time my hands are filthy it's awesome thank you so much for watching that video if\u00a0\nyou'd like to further support us on tested there\u00a0\u00a0 are many ways you can do so one is through paid\u00a0\nmembership and there are several tiers of that\u00a0\u00a0 each with their own set of unique bonuses you can\u00a0\nfollow the links below for that or you can go to\u00a0\u00a0 our merch store where we are always coming up\u00a0\nwith brand new products in honor of the holidays\u00a0\u00a0 we've got our tested ugly sweater in both black\u00a0\nand we have a white one we have some brand new\u00a0\u00a0 patches and this is a particular type that i\u00a0\nmade a joke about one day and now it's a reality\u00a0\u00a0 you know a merit badges when you're a cub\u00a0\nscout or a boy scout you get a merit badge\u00a0\u00a0 for achieving something well tested now has\u00a0\ndemerit badges for when you screw something up\u00a0\u00a0 because that's just as important in\u00a0\nlearning as getting something right\u00a0\u00a0 so this is the badge for when you measure\u00a0\nsomething once and have to cut it twice\u00a0\u00a0 this is the badge for when you accidentally hook\u00a0\nup your electronics wrong and you release the\u00a0\u00a0 mysterious blue smoke that powers them and they no\u00a0\nlonger work and this one here is for when you get\u00a0\u00a0 your finger caught in the lathe and it almost\u00a0\ngets torn off that might be quite me specific\u00a0\u00a0 i hope that never happens to you these are all\u00a0\ndesigned by tested's own gen schachter and they\u00a0\u00a0 are not the only patches we're going to release\u00a0\nin fact these are just the beginning if you have\u00a0\u00a0 ideas for demerit badges that we should release\u00a0\nwe'd love to hear them we also still have our\u00a0\u00a0 regular complement of posters and they're all\u00a0\nback in stock including my hand-drawn toolboxes\u00a0\u00a0 i love seeing pictures you guys send us of these\u00a0\nhanging in your maker spaces and your offices your\u00a0\u00a0 man caves and your sheds around the world get to\u00a0\nthe store follow the links below and hey some of\u00a0\u00a0 these might make great christmas presents for the\u00a0\nmakers in your life thanks you guys happy holidays", "aGWwQMeM5N4": "what are lightsabers sound boards what's they even do and which ones are the best i'm sorry i just i just realized i saw the mask on it's so weird i was out doing stuff and i came back to start filming i forgot i had oh this is my design by the way rogue christmas design for merch i don't know if you guys are interested but you can actually buy this right underneath the video of my merch store i don't know just if you want i'm not trying to shove merch in your face sorry this this light is making it really hot for some reason i'm just gonna take off my hoodie really quick okay that's so much better hello there welcome this is star wars in real life where we fill a live star wars instead of actually important things like getting right to the point in a video this video is part of a series of videos designed to help star wars fans build their very first lightsaber so if you've ever wanted to build your own lightsaber and you saw all the work involved you got confused on the internet and you just decided yeah no you know i know exactly how you feel that's what these videos are for they're for you so definitely check out this playlist right up here for more videos of the same like last week i did a video where i talked about the top seven lightsaber companies that you should know about in 2021 so if you're just starting out you don't even have a lightsaber hilt yet you're just looking for somewhere to buy please watch that video first you're going to thank me later in star wars the clone wars there's an arc where this group of younglings go with ahsoka tano and yoda to the planet ilum to search for their first keywords i mean kyber crystals which they then used to build their lightsabers with the kyber crystal is like the heart of the lightsaber and that's kind of what soundboards are in fact some soundboards are actually referred to as parts by their manufacturer and part of the reason soundboards are so confusing is because the actual term sound boards is a misnomer i heard the term soundboard and i was like oh that must be the board inside the lightsaber that controls all the sounds and even though i wasn't technically wrong i wasn't completely right and that's because they also control the color of your blade the flow of power and all the other behaviors of your lightsaber for example do you want to hear your lightsaber clash every time you physically hit it against something of course or do you want kylo ren to shout at you whenever you ignite your lightsaber yeah you do ravage my saber you impenetrable blockade corrupt my kyber crystal you pensive bantha now i said in a previous video which i will link to right up here that you better know what you want your lightsaber to do before you even start thinking about sound boards and that's because not all sound boards are the same some don't support neopixel and others just have like one or two colors to pick from and unfortunately in real life we don't have sound boards calling out to us through the force like the kyber crystals did for the younglings so that means we have to find and choose them ourselves but luckily choosing a soundboard is much easier than choosing a lightsaber because there's not that many people making them in fact there are two types of soundboard manufacturers specialists and non-specialists imagine that you're at the apple store and you just purchased a brand new iphone the iphone 12 pro plus not the mini and now you need to buy a case apple specializes in making iphones but they also sell cases which would be super convenient for you because all of your shopping can just be done in that one store or you could go shop somewhere else and maybe find a better case made by a company that specializes in phone cases like otterbox for example which practically makes your phone indestructible it's the same thing for soundboards lightsaber companies like ultrasabers sabreforge the poc store kr sabres electrum sabercrafts they are all like apple they specialize in making lightsabers but they also dabble in soundboards which you can add to your lightsaber order on their website so those are the non-specialists as for the actual specialists the two most popular are plector labs and frederick hubenet collector labs is an electronics company founded by irv plector he self-taught himself how to build program and mass-produce circuit boards from the ground up and now sells what's arguably the best sound board on the planet the crystal focus 10. also known as the cfx which is what i have right here and prior to the cfx he made several other sound boards like the prism pico crumble and the nano biscotti frederick hubenet is a software developer and engineer responsible for creating the other best sound board on the planet the profi also he might be loki a genius according to his website his personal interests include computers programming algorithms and math he's also worked as a senior software developer for amazon and google and oh yeah he also invented his own programming language those two guys are the specialists in the soundboard industry and if you were to google best sound boards those two would be in the top two places of every list because they represent the cutting edge in lightsaber tech right now the cfx works with all blade types and leds like neopixel tri-cree and accent leds it's got smooth swing flash on clash lock up blaster deflection stab tip drag and other blade effects like flame unstable rainbow rain it's got space for 32 color profiles and 32 blade profiles and even allows mixing match you can program certain sounds for when you insert or remove your blade or when you try turning on your lightsaber without a blade inserted it's got support for bluetooth and motion sensing for font selection and literally so much more there's an entire list of features like three pages worth of features in the manual half of which i didn't even understand at all the profi has the potential for all of that and more because the profit board is open source and if you don't know what that means imagine buying a car you go to the car dealership you pay for it you drive it off the lot that is the cfx it's ready to go right out of the box you got satellite radio you got air conditioning you got seat warmers but you're locked into those features those are the only features you can ever have in your car sort of if one day you decide to add a prototype swoop accelerator to your car and enter in a swoop race your catalog now imagine that instead of buying a car you purchased a car frame very aggressive choice that's the profit you have complete control over what your car ends up looking like you choose the engine you choose the speaker system you choose the prototype sweep accelerator but you gotta learn how to build a pc car or you can give your car frame to a very trusted individual so that they can build your dream car but you gotta pay them and once you do get that car back you're kind of stuck again because if you change your mind about any of the features you requested you have to send it back have them fix it and that's the difference between the cfx and the profit the cfx is a lamborghini the profit is a disassembled but completely customizable lamborghini you have complete control over what your car ends up looking like and the profit requires a ton of setup just to get started with the profi for example you need to download specific software and drivers on your computer just to be able to start programming all those different lightsaber effects and if you're not already experienced with coding i mean you can theoretically the possible lightsaber effects you make are limitless realistically you are limited by your imagination your skill with arduino whatever limitations exist with arduino whatever limitations exist with led technology i don't even know what that is but it's super hard and pretty much everyone i've ever spoken to told me hey man if you're building your first lightsaber yes the profi is super dope and you can do anything you want but start with something easy so while those two sound boards represent the best of the best that's not to say that other sound boards don't deserve your attention also because they do the verso board for example the man behind the company kr sabres he built the verso specifically to help newcomers getting into lightsaber building it's a lot simpler and easier to solder but still has most of the premium features that people want in their lightsabers things like smooth swing neopixel support flash on clash it's basically like a watered down cfx a lot simpler still very powerful and very solid and still a very popular choice among sabersmiths electrum sabercraft is another great innovative company that makes their own soundboards with great features like being able to connect to your phone with your lightsaber so that you can change your lightsaber effects like on the fly so that's what soundboards are that's what they do and that's what some of the best sound boards are now where do you buy them i'll throw a bunch of links down in the video description below but here's the basic rundown the cfx and the profit you can buy from various lightsaber companies like savory trio corban vader's vault for example usually it's the stores that don't sell their own sound boards right you can also find the cfx on the custom saber shop the verso board you can buy on saberarmory.com and corban and you can find the other store specific sound boards on their respective companies websites you can also pretty much find anything you want on sites like etsy and ebay but of course use your own judgment when you purchase things like these from strangers so hopefully this video helps clear out any confusion surrounding sound boards especially for beginner and future sabersmiths out there including myself next week we're going to take a deeper dive look into the rest of the lightsaber components like the battery the speaker switches the leds and in the meantime i'm actually gonna start installing my sound board into my lightsaber right over here and i'm gonna film the entire process from start to finish and post up those full length videos for my patrons so if you're interested in coming along with me on my journey to become a jedi in real life a j r r l a journal that's nothing check out my new tier on patreon otherwise i'll still be posting like highlights and the important lessons i learned about lightsaber building here just on my youtube channel everyone wins until then you will subscribe to this youtube channel we [Music] will keep on living star wars and my girlfriend is relo trash like straight trash all right yeah i'll see you in the next video", "L5h6BFZktJ4": "mastercam here recently i was asked if i thought that a lightsaber was a practical weapon to use in a fight then i was given this replica by nina from the 501st here in albuquerque but we're not going to use it for two reasons uh number one in america we don't train with toys and number two uh she only gave us one of them so instead we're gonna use flashlights which work pretty much the same way okay i can't figure out how to turn the cross guards on there's a power switch here but i didn't want to force it so yeah there we go so let's say todd and i are in a situation we're about to do bathroom okay first thing that he's going to want to do as a jedi is to touch tips with me next thing he's going to attempt is to slide down my shaft and cut my hands off but you'll notice that that actually is blocked his blade is blocked by the cross guard it's protecting my hands so it's using a defensive technique here by blocking this but how can it be used as an offensive technique well i can slide down the blade now and simply by rotating my hands i can use the cross guard to disarm him so uh i don't understand what all the complaining about the crossguard lightsaber is i think it's a pretty practical weapon uh i think as long as you're careful with it it's very effective and frankly i can't think of one reason why you wouldn't want to run out and get one right now damn it", "mngZjpZ_HhI": "all right this mod is a very simple mod it's a lightsaber mod two imposters that have lightsabers two crewmates can also have lightsabers cancel meetings i cancel meeting all right i can't see me how can i get [Applause] yummy you're not part of the jedi council now yummy's you know his powers are strong you know the force is with him but but he is a murderer i sense a lot of anger i'm being honest pizza and anger you can have it is he the child of destiny though is the child of destiny oh we're all going to die wow think how cool would be if it was like like in rogue one we could just see a red lightsaber like shoot up in the dark that would be great oh i just it's not me that is not me where are you going i heard one i heard one meeting it's gone i heard one yeah okay dead body head body white light he's the only one that went to lights yeah they're like there's six of us at the table yeah this isn't yummy or moo so it's you no it's not not i literally heard it from storage and then walked in and reported the body it was very simple so it's either it's either you yummy or moo no it's not yeah it's not i can't have permeability it's not working should have stayed with us when we were in the circle jerk we had a high council circle jerk and you left with somebody left okay i'd like to know what's being jerked in the jerking meeting you can see a lightsaber at nighttime trust me yeah haven't you seen rope one where it's all dark and then the red lights watch that movie how big is your lifesaver non-existent non-existent guys it's really embarrassing to talk about when you stuck it in van nose did he enjoy it i didn't do this i don't know why you think i did it i'm telling you guys next one of the other options is yummy who is a lightsaber next and then i ran down with no glue and then we heard another lightsaber in lights from storage so somebody in the high council circle jerk is lying god i'm connecting lightsabers right here bluetooth lightsaber to blue lightsaber are you gonna have your lightsabers touch yellow yeah just touch tips from in there if i find out somebody's imposter i'm going to see which one of you is imposter huh you no not me [Music] you're you're you're the little one what's the fight i do have a lightsaber i can prove it you're young not the youngest not the younglings not the younglings okay where'd he go who yeah yummy in here move what dump to the dark side oh my god i told you it was [ __ ] okay okay what i did okay i definitely it's definitely me [Laughter] okay but i did it because it's just too funny i goes come to the dark side and then i cut the lights and then he killed scotty instead of me yeah yeah this man tried to kill me and my youngling i'm voting yeah yummy yeah i heard yummy saying like i could hear yummy talking i couldn't find him it all makes sense very soon oh my gosh was scotty your teammate [Laughter] [Music] brock and i was gonna slap marcel i have a joke okay okay anyway i get away from us i get away over here bro wait i heard a lot over there oh do you want to compare sizes yeah i see your schwartz is as big as mine [Applause] all right so you guys are both the good guys so yeah i'm just gonna hang out with you guys just just windmill around marcel and we'll protect it yeah [Laughter] we're doing lightsaber death run lifesaver where are you tyler tyler tyler where is he oh he's murdering everyone where'd he go where'd he go uh face me like a mansion okay got the revenge on tyler i was a force ghost that doesn't really make sense but what happened is they tried to do that they came back from the dead okay so it's either scotty or vanoss that's not me dude i would have killed you are we skipping yeah we're skipping but scotty you better anybody hear me from the grave tyler you killed me and i could still see my lightsaber so i went for it i don't know who it is there's no point in doing tasks at this point i know but i don't know where anybody is oh [ __ ] here we go we gotta find the body we gotta find the body get me [Laughter] [Music] oh my gosh do you have a lightsaber no i was that right reactor though wait hold on i'm skipping because i want to have a duel with whoever has one last hey you have a red one no no no it's blue blue yes it is it's blue mine's wet [Laughter] hey marcel do you have a lightsaber i have one i have one you gotta be kidding me marcel right click to hold it out and then left click and swing that [Laughter] [Applause] [ __ ] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] marcel you are the only killer this round you must choose you've got to sense the dark force inside it's within you marcel marcel marcel stand by the diving board at the lava we will one at a time go up and you will tell us whether we live or die yes are you a good boy [Laughter] this is literally a thumbnail dude it was not him it's okay everybody makes mistakes you're okay oh my god it was nice i didn't get much time at all so i'm starting to question how good you are execution [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] one at a time cut down all the crewmates thank you guys thank you so much [Applause] holy [ __ ] [Music] show us your blue lightsaber then yeah i will i think that's i will i'll show you guys i'll show you where we're going where'd he go you go do it i'll defend stay back i'll defend stay back oh nice nice yummy right there he's right there nobody no it's not me screw you what did i do just in general it was all no glass fault is the game over please tell me it's not okay because i don't want it to end [Laughter] [Laughter] okay so so listen ty we know dylan's is blue right but you know mine's blue too lights got called right i know that there's obviously an imposter left because there's game's not over and so lights get called so i'm like stay the [ __ ] back so i pulled out my saber and just swung circles around me until it just walked into it for no reason so anyways i started blasting is what you're saying i started swinging dude i didn't want nobody to touch me i didn't want the imposter to sneak up on me and kill me so i was swinging it well you it worked at the expense of an innocent man he walked into it i was clearly made he could hear it swinging and he even said my name before he walked in yeah i can confirm tyler's as blue yeah phil had one because he i can't hear him he didn't have one i tried to yeah i didn't even go near the lights i went up towards drop ship and he still just walked like he was doing can we all skip and test out my windmill strategy yeah see if it's beatable dude all right i'm gonna go on the diving board you [ __ ] guys try to get to me one at a time what could go wrong guys you don't max out that dpi either oh wait wait let's get lights let's get let's go i got oh my god oh my god i'm bumping up one dpi level for sure [ __ ] okay fine 800 dpi okay i'm going to the thing now i'm going to do that i just saw scotty's dead body at the meeting table [Music] this determines it we're gonna see scotty's dead body flop down [Music] the lava the lava right yeah let's go let's go seriously whoever wins this wins like the game is over start right now don't get me [ __ ] wait oh what if i just can i just poke you touch tips touch tips all right okay dead die master [Laughter] that is how you bring balance to the force right tell us i guess if the crew with the lightsabers can figure out who the impossible oh [ __ ] [Applause] okay [Laughter] get the [ __ ] out of here [Music] dang it can we restart", "YUwt2jy6SDA": "you guys welcome back and if you're new here this is mike star walker we reenact fights make our own choreographies and tutorials for more content like this make sure to like and subscribe hey guys welcome to our first jedi workout video i made this to help improve our accuracy and control during fight choreography and i'd highly recommend this as a warm-up before you start working on your fights you might be able to follow along but i would recommend you watch our basics video first because i will be referring to the number system we use when we set choreography this is where the fun begins alright let's get down and plank for 30 seconds keep your back as straight as possible having a strong core is really important for fight choreography a stronger core can help immensely with speed control and accuracy all right get up and get your saber ready arms straight forward we're going to do 10 reps of this on the right hand and then 10 reps on the left now same

hit the bell let me know if you'd want this to become a series in the comments below and if so let me know if you want to be more or less challenging next time because i get asked this all the time the lightsaber i used in this video is from spectrum savers not only do these have all the features but they can withstand full contact dueling which we tested extensively i am an affiliate with this lightsaber company so if you use my code in the description box below to buy one of these lightsabers it'll help support our channel i hope you guys have a great rest of your day and may the force be with you you", "d2w7xAffA1A": "[Music] lightsabers come in many colors but what do those colors mean allow us to break it down an elegant weapon for a more civilized age the lightsaber is neither clumsy nor random and each one is unique like a snowflake a very very dangerous snowflake and if you've seen the rise of Skywalker you might be wondering what a yellow bladed lightsaber means and maybe where we might have seen one before well we've got you covered but be warned we will be obviously getting into some rise of Skywalker's spoilers so if you're trying to avoid that kind of thing now is the time to step out for a little fresh air until we're done first off a quick refresher the color the lightsabres blade is determined by its Kyber crystal inside the important thing is the colors mean something or at least they did to the Jedi Order prior to order 66 and if we're talking about blade colors let's start with the classics blue green and red blue blades were used by Jedi guardians these were the fighters who focused on using the force and a physical tactical way some notable users include obi-wan Kenobi for starters anakin skywalker and about half of the corpses at the Battle of Geonosis r.i.p green blades like this one were used by jedi consulars these were the deep thinkers of the Jedi Order he pondered the many mysteries of the forest to combat the dark side at its most profound spiritual levels notable users include Yoda qui-gon jinn and a farm boy named Luke Skywalker you already know this one the red blades were used by dark side force users red blades occur when a user funnels the dark side of the force into the crystal corrupting it and bending it to their evil will some notable users pretty much every dark Sider and the entire saga has won and so did their many associated wannabes at the end of rise of Skywalker ray shows off her brand-new yellow bladed lightsaber seemingly crafted from the staff she'd been lugging around for three movies yellow blades were used by Jedi sentinels wielding the force with the perfect blend of knowledge and power Sentinel served as the deadly guards of the Jedi Temple some notable users will rave for one her new saber is yellow along with the temple guards who wielded foldable double bladed lightsaber this party food purple blades were used by Jedi skilled and experienced enough to dance on the fringes of both the light and dark sides of the force the most notable wielder of a purple blade would certainly be mace windu who also employed a fighting style forbidden to most of the Jedi Order because it drew on elements of the dark side to enhance its ferocity [Music] and while we're on the topic of dead Mandalorians let's talk about the dark saber the Mandalorian stole this ancient black bladed lightsaber from the Jedi Temple and according to their custom whoever wields it claims the title of Mandalore the leader of the Mandalorian people I [Music] know Jedi and that brings us to white seem used by only one character in the Star Wars canon ahsoka tano when an adult ahsoka appears in Star Wars rebels she's carrying two white bladed sabers with curved hills she took the crystals from the inquisitors sixth brother after defeating him using the Force to purify the crystals from corrupted red to brilliant white the color also points to his sokka's free agent status she's neither Jedi nor sit but now it's your turn to tell me what you think what color lightsaber would you wield what color do you main and Jedi fall in order let me know in the comments below bad spelling and grammar' only please anyway thanks for watching and now that you're all caught up join us as we break down the epic maul versus qui-gon and obi-wan duel and Phantom Menace it's the best one in the whole saga disagree fight me just as long as you follow and subscribe to i GN wherever you like to watch", "EYp5ZjTj7vM": "boom whose saber have we got here landon legacy lightsaber from star wars galaxy's edge come stick around guys we're gonna do a full review and we're gonna give you three reasons why you should add this to your collection and three reasons why you might want to pass on this one so yeah if you like deadly jedi weapons vlogs from a galaxy far far away or anything star wars make sure to hit the subscription button and the notifications bell so you don't miss any of our videos [Music] all right good one buddy we always got to start every one of our saber reviews with some dancing so we have got our hands on the fourth addition to the legacy lightsaber series since galaxy's edge opened like a year and a half ago so dooku's lightsaber so let's just take a moment to to uh talk about the prequels like the phantom menace the attack of the clones and revenge of the uh thanks dude i think lucas was thinking to himself we have got to show some people some new saber stuff right because for the original trilogy two-handed basic lightsabers right but what do we see in the prequels we see general grievous has four lightsabers yoda has a little lightsaber right and then darth maul has a double end-to-end lightsaber qui-gon jinns has got the long saber and then dooku has the banana saber whoa all kinds of new sabers are flying around the prequels man that makes five dude yeah so there's all kinds of new saber action and designs and shapes in the prequel trilogy right pretty cool we're gonna dive right into the video of three reasons why you have to add this to your collection and three more reasons why you may want to pass on this one are you ready the saber retails in galaxy's edge for 130 dollars all right so the first reason why you have to add this to your collection is the undeniable and unique design of the count dooku lightsaber right all right dude go ahead and take it out whoa okay you gotta be a little more careful with that really sharp pointy part sticking out of the emitter okay yeah we don't want to go to the hospital tonight that's not gonna be a good evening but this design is super unique undeniably very cool i mean look how dark and like scary and vicious this design looks right did you know yoda trained count dooku what yoda trained him to be a jedi hey by the way so when count dooku was a jedi do you think he had a different lightsaber that looked a little bit more friendly and peaceful i don't know if you guys know leave a comment down below for us all right i think it was a blue one but when he i think someone bent it and that's why it's red and it looks like a banana that's a good theory maybe uh his lightsaber was straight when he was a jedi and it's bent when he went to the dark side right i tell you one thing is that there's a big difference here i've noticed between this design and the force effects count dooku which reminds me if you guys want us to do a full comparison right of the legacy and the force effects count dooku then give us 300 likes on this video we'll do a big full comparison that takes me like weeks to edit it's gonna be awesome okay so give us those likes you know the hilt is this like beautiful polished look to it i can see myself in it my fit head's really wide and it's got the classic design let's see it even has the gold accents are a bit more like a darker gold color how does the grip feel bud oh oh yeah the grip feels awesome it's actually uh the grip is like a rubber material and it feels really cool huh um this trigger solid doesn't do anything kind of kind of see-through actually and so this battery pack just barely sits in here like this and you got to put the whole pommel piece all the way back on there and when you tighten it it sits really nice to follow the flow of the saber down down the inside of it now the uh ignition switch is a very discreet part of the uh the underbelly here the frame has this little tiny switch that's the ignition switch there so um this brings us to our first reason why you may want to skip on this lightsaber is because i found a few small pieces on the on the hilt here that already wiggle now if you didn't catch our previous video about uh searching for sabersmith we show that our mace windu saver wiggling and squeaking all over the place so this is kind of giving me a little deja vu about that this neat kind of golden accent up near the emitter here try and wiggle that yeah it's kind of wiggly there um the activation switch it's a little tiny bit jiggly but we just took this out of the box okay so i'm sure after you have this for a year that activation switch might be a little bit more loose and it might activate or deactivate more when you don't want it to and the other part that seemed a little bit kind of wiggly is the the sharp accent at the emitter here yeah it squeaks a little bit right it's not all one piece in the upper half of the saber you can see near the emitter there's a little cut out here see how there's a little piece that means that this sharp piece was added afterwards there's a little bit of squeaking and it doesn't really wiggle it's just you can tell that it's not one piece this this might be a problem in the future right it could get more wiggly and loose and then you really don't want this you know that's going to really bring down the feeling of quality but this is the sounds like there's three mice that are cursing at each other that's what it sounds like but i can hear it inside the emitter it's a squeak fest in there all right so the squeak fest we'll just add with the wiggly parts category okay we also can't forget to mention the smuggler who helped us get this lightsaber from disney world his name is dave allen he was super professional fast shipping and a link to his facebook will be down in our description the unique sound effects of this lightsaber make the number two reason why you're gonna want to add this to your collection right yeah all right now it's time to power this up and check out the sound can i boom of course you can buddy go for it whoa yes i love it unique legacy sound effects do they have even new unique sound effects for count dooku man so it's got like the sith activation right kind of sounds like darth maul and it's per but it purrs different it has a different tone of perv and this is the coolest part you can hear it over the squeaking which legacy sabres are known uh to squeak because they're trying to absorb some of the shock here in the attachment of the blades so that if you duel a little bit it doesn't uh echo down into the electronics and damage the lightsaber right but they're really oh that's really cool there's no other saber that sounds like that have you heard really cool swinging sound effects let's check out the clash effects okay all right go ahead and deactivate dude count dooku man so this brings us to the second reason why you may want to skip on this lightsaber is because of the low volume of sound that comes out of it so even though the sound is really crisp and clear it's also a little bit on the quiet side too probably one of the more quieter legacy sabers it sounds like a seth lightsaber oh no it sounds great it sounds like a sith but the volume it's not very loud is what i'm saying like darth vader's almost startles you it's so loud but because the sound is coming through this really chunky uh pommel of the design that's just kind of what you know you got to be prepared for that that's what's going happen if you're outside if there's cars if you're dueling uh lightly with this then you're gonna have a hard time hearing it okay so the third reason why you do want to add this to your collection is for the interchangeable blades which you cannot do with a lot of other light sabers just like the force effect saver boom 26 31 or 36 inch blades give you a variety if you wanted to you know for different ages different reasons for cosplay for for dueling for for whatever reason which makes this saber just like the rest of the legacy sabers pretty unique you like the medium one i usually give you medium and all the sabers yeah medium's your favorite and then of course large is my favorite more screen accurate you know plus size matters [Music] he doesn't get the joke and then the final reason why you may want to skip on this lightsaber it's hard to hold this saber without touching the ignition switch so that could be an advantage but i think more often than not you're going to deactivate this on accident so you could try to hold it above the activation switch or below this little piece right there but it is very easy to activate or deactivate so for that reason we're going to add that to the list of reasons why you may not want to pick up this saber it wouldn't be uh finding the force saber review unless we compare this to the saber in the film that he uses right yeah so let's take a look at the pictures i found okay okay so here in this picture of count dooku having it on his on his hip the circular belt clips i love them because they don't swing left and right they just swing forward and backwards you can see the gold accents you can see has actually a smaller stripe within it on the grip fine detail you can see kind of the it's it's ribbed up near the tip what what's so funny nothing nothing's funny bud so far looks just like his right yeah all right let's try a different picture this is uh the pictures we always like to refer to the master replicas that lucasfilm had joined with them to make replicas of the savers right so is that look exactly like the picture that yeah that looks like the same everything about it looks the same the accents the little designs around the accents look perfect the trigger looks perfect everything is the same even down to the exact shape and angulation of this dangerous dagger on the front of the emitter now that will poke somebody and the final photo we could ah that's an interesting way to display the saber the emitter is different because it holds the blade with the legacy but otherwise looks just like the replica right so no surprise there right disney making replicas of the sabres from the movies they bought if you buy this saber you know you're buying an almost near perfect replica of count dooku's lightsaber all right guys so don't forget if you want us to do a full comparison with the forcefx give us 300 likes and don't you guys forget to have an awesome star wars day i don't have a ball oh [Music] you", "1Cy_b5SJ6Kk": "the space battles are cool the villains are legendary and the world is amazing but the real question is what does your lightsaber color say about you the galaxy of star wars is full of adventures legend and excitement ever since george lucas brought his swashbuckling space opera to life the face of movies and science fiction hasn't been the same nothing has quite captured our collective imaginations though like the lightsaber lightsabers come in a range of colors that can tell you a whole lot about who's wielding it let's see how those meanings have evolved and what they mean now it all started a long time ago in a galaxy far far away when a farm boy met a hermit who said he knew the kid's dead and gave him an ancient weapon from a more civilized time fortunately luke wasn't looking straight down the hilt when he turned the thing on from that point on every kid has made buzzing noises while swinging around broom handles and flashlights in the dark hoping to channel the force in those early days there were just three colors the blue of obi-wan kenobi and luke skywalker the green of luke skywalker again and the menacing red of the sith lord darth vader that had a lot more to do with there only being four jedi in the entire series with two of them being in the same family one of the biggest strengths of star wars is how well it suggested a wider universe lived in by the characters inside that's what gave birth to what's known as the expanded universe the skywalker saga as well as the story of the star wars galaxy became the subject of comic books novels and games and through the expanded universe we learned that the colors weren't just a style choice but would actually indicate what kind of jedi you were that is more or less for most of the lightsabers especially early on in the stories jedis could use any of the colors available as the stories progressed the colors and their roles became more defined the blue lightsaber of the skywalkers and kenobi were for the jedi guardians these were the heavy force users the front line of the jedi who confronted enemies of the republic hands are a hard thing to hold on to in the star wars universe and when luke lost his and a duel with his daddy he also lost his dad's old blue lightsaber for production reasons luke's blade went from blue to green to contrast against the blue skies but in the wider universe we got a much more satisfying reason to go green green became the color of the jedi consulars the jedi who thought deep thoughts about what it is to be a jedi as luke began to grow into his adopted role as the one to bring the jedi back he adopted the consular's green reflecting his desire to turn darth vader back to the light instead of defeating him in battle i see you have constructed a new lightsaber green would show up again as the color of choice for the wise qui-gon chin and much to everyone's excitement yoda when he said he shouldn't be judged by his size we didn't know it meant that crazy frog leave lightsaber fight kind of thing that was awesome the novels and prequels gave us a glimpse into an era that was chock full of jedi opening the door for even more colors for instance the jedi sentinels a balance between the guardians and the consulars who have other sets of skills sort of a jedi that do the more subtle work of the jedi so subtle in fact that sidious was concerned that they might survive order 66. there was one notable sentinel that was big on negotiation who had her own special color orange she also had another distinction up until baby yoda stormed our hearts in the mandalorian as that she was the only member of yoda's species we ever saw and we still don't know what they're called unless it's baby yoda which we just call adorable in the star wars universe a lone wookie can be an intimidating thing a lone wookie jedi with a molten bronze lightsaber might just be terrifying thanks to its wielder lobaka the bronze lightsaber became associated with strength imperial knights were known for their white lightsabers the original color of lightsabers before production added colors to distinguish the blades during the fights the imperial knights are probably the biggest victim of the canon divide the imperial knights rejected the sith but weren't exactly all about the light being considered grey jedi of all the colors this will be the biggest change from the expanded universe and the current canon the sith preferred their menacing red achieved initially through synthetic crystals where the other jedi used natural crystals to focus their sabers powers and to give them their color that explanation gets a lot darker later on we'll get to it and then there's samuel l jackson the man that's so cool you have to use his full name every time samuel l jackson wanted to be in the new star wars movies and while we all want to be in star wars we're not samuel l jackson he had another request when he joined the jedi order and that was that his lightsaber be purple his favorite color so that's what samuel l jackson got like the green saber though it wasn't just a production consideration meaning was added again in the expanded universe in this case it comes down to how you make purple that provides a hint towards its meaning purple is a combination of blue the jedi guardians and red the color of the set this means that those who hold a purple saber have developed an understanding of both the light and dark sides of the force not quite the grey jedi but at least with a toe in the dark side being attuned to some part of the dark side of the force as well as the martial ability of the jedi guardians those who wield the purple lightsabers are a force to be reckoned with especially if that jedi is being played by samuel l jackson there were a lot more colors and variations of colors throughout the expanded universe including cyan viridian gold and more sometimes they had meaning sometimes the meaning wasn't always quite so clear if all of this feels arbitrary and after the fact well it is but that's not entirely unheard of the color of the hulk started grey but went green for publishing concerns but then also became a vehicle for different hulk personalities one of the strengths of serialized storytelling is that one author can take a seemingly arbitrary element and build meaning into it but then things can get tricky when you start trying to determine whose additions count and who's don't that complication became all the more complicated when lucas sold star wars to the hungriest hippo in media disney one of the very first things that disney did with their new property was draw a clear line between what was now canon and what was not and the expanded universe got the axe what this ultimately means is that any star wars stories that are made under disney's stewardship wouldn't have to honor anything that happened to the expanded universe ultimately star wars is how you experience but any stories going forward will only build on the universe presented in the movies and animated series that doesn't mean that things start from zero again though series like clone wars and star wars rebels have built on the implied mythology of the films in the same way that the original expanded universe did including adding some of its own spin on the role of color in choosing a lightsaber the new canon also simplified a bit the makeup of lightsaber tech and the crystal that focuses its power primarily now through kyber crystals that also give the lightsaber its color so what are the colors in the new canon we'll break down the eight basic colors blue first up of course is blue the original elegant weapon from a more civilized time it was anakin's lightsaber that kenobi took off of him after gaining the higher ground just like before this is favored by the jedi guardians the front-line jedi who focus on their dueling and combat skills within the force green another one that remains largely unchanged green goes to the consular jedi who contemplate the nature of the force it's the color used by masters like qui-gon jinn yoda and luke skywalker as a jedi master now that you should underestimate their skills with a lightsaber though yellow a skywalker at least by name has carried all the main colors of the lightsaber at one point or another anakin and luke started blue anakin then adopted red to go with his new dark side lifestyle and luke went green after committing to bringing about the return of the jedi rey when she takes the skywalker name also takes on the yellow saber as a jedi sentinel this time used by jedi temple guards the role of the sentinel jedi being a balance between the guardians and consulars seems important in rey choosing that color for her new life as an honorary skywalker and as a guardian of the new age of jedi purple mace windu's purple saber stays the same indicating someone who has adopted some skills from the dark side or an understanding of it generally best for when you need someone who won't back down when they have to say arrest the chancellor who is secretly a sith lord white everyone's favorite padawan ahsoka tano eventually wielded a pair of white lightsabers that she got after purifying the crystals from an inquisitor's blade unlike the other colors white served to signal that she was not affiliated with a branch of the jedi or the dark side with signs pointing to rosario dawson playing ahsoka in the second season of the mandalorian we might get another look at the white sabers orange orange is more or less new to the game by being a new part of a game it was introduced as a pre-order incentive for jedi fallen order the last time orange had appeared was in the master and apprentice series as a rare force attuned non-kyber crystal red red is the color of the sith and they get their color in the most sithy way possible by bumming their kyber crystal out they focus all their anger and emotions into the crystal until it burns red harsh black if you watched season one of the mandalorian but not star wars rebels you might have been surprised by moff gideon's black lightsaber cutting him out of his fallen ship if you did watch rebels then you would recognize it as the lightsaber of the first mandalorian jedi that was passed around through history before sabine wren handed it over to bo katan to lead the mandalorians we'll have to wait until season 2 of the mandalorian to find out how moth gideon got his hands on it while the skywalker saga has wrapped up with a third trilogy disney in the star wars franchise is far from done with the jedi there are a lot of new star wars movies live action and animated shows and video games all in the planning stage and inevitably more to follow we can expect that more of the old expanded universe canon colors will make their way into the current canon with some changes and some similarities as of now however most of these projects are just various creators like taiko itty and ryan johnson at the head of otherwise undefined projects with the future of the star wars universe wide open and a rainbow of colors to choose from we're bound to see the color variations once seen in the expanded universe those are the meanings of the lightsabers in the star wars universe what color is your lightsaber what color do you want to see come back let us know in the comments and while you're there make sure and

and do I have a treat for you I have my good friend Katie Beirne here and she is going to share some amazing things with you so without further ado let's welcome her to show you something awesome hey there Katie from beltway balloons here in Washington DC at ww Beltway balloons calm today I'm going to show you my line work lightsaber I always ask the kids if they want red or blue or green because those are lightsaber colors so today we're going to make blue we're going to kick it old school luke skywalker style you're going to take a clear 260 and you're going to put a 160 inside it should just fit nicely in there should fit nicely in there and you literally just feed it right into the 260 we're going to inflate both of these but not at the same time first you're going to put some air into the clear 260 so you're just going to stick your pump in between the nozzle of the 160 and the 260 I'm going to give it about four pumps one two three four maybe five maybe six let me give it six pumps then you're going to inflate the 160 so you're going to hang on to this and then you're going to get your pump on to your 164 your 160 on to your phone make sure that the nozzle goes into the 260 because otherwise your 160 is going to inflate outside and that's not what you want the 101 plate it inside so now you have your 160 inflated inside of your 260 a little bit of air to make it easier to tie [Music] and then you're going to come up to where the 160 ends go ahead and twist that off and then just deflate the clear tie it off and then you can cut off the excess for the handle I'm using a black 260 about halfway inflated and we're just going to do a super simple base we're going to do three loop twists it's going to be about three fingers wrap the not around bring the nozzle through the mill and that will secure it make two more notes you could do this with a 350 you could do this with silver you can really use your imagination with this one but this will make it simple we're going to make a handle about six or seven inches in length get rid of the excess tie the bottom off now we're going to take the knot of our 160 and 260 and we're going to tie that into our loop twists for the handle and then what I usually do for this one to make it super strong is to wrap the 260 around the loop twist and that'll make it nice and secure there you have a super-fast lightsaber WOM WOM WOM so when you've got a line of 30 kids and the kid wants you know the Death Star in full detail you can offer them this and I guarantee you they're going to be happy I'm Katie with bellway balloons if you like what you see please kick like please subscribe to see ids channel go ahead and leave us a comment let's see any know what you'd like to see from her as she does balloon videos every week go forth and baloo defy [Music]", "C4awHdhSdtw": "back everybody and today we'll be continuing our lightsaber crystal series for today's video we'll be discussing the extremely rare lightsaber color pink and exactly how jedi acquired this lightsaber color as for this video we will be strictly pertaining to star wars legend so keep that dudley noted that there will be very little to no canon star wars content within this video as the pink color in star wars canon currently does not exist so without further ado let's discuss the dantari lightsaber crystal the dantari lightsaber crystals are uniquely found on the planet of dantooine the same planet that would later become a rebel stronghold during the time of the empire a dantari lightsaber crystal could only be found in the eggs of a kinrath a kinrath being a dangerous species on the planet however the lightsaber crystals could only be found extremely rarely in a kinrath species and it would be dangerous to acquire the eggs of a kinrath so the force wielders had to be very careful most horse wielders that acquired a crystal here were extremely skilled in the ability of beast control meaning they could subtly manipulate the mind of a kinrath before they acquired their egg in search for a lightsaber crystal but again this process was extremely dangerous as in a lot of cases the kinrath were large in number the dantari lightsaber crystals though had something very unique to them and something that later star wars canon would adopt that being a dantari lightsaber crystal would actually imprint upon the force wielder that claimed it so the dentari crystal would adopt a color similar to the force wielder just as is done in star wars canon when a force wielder imbues upon a crystal the dantari lightsaber crystals were famous for producing extremely rare color again with pink being among these but also colors such as purple and yellow they also produced more common colors though such as red green and blue but a dantari lightsaber crystal is one of the rare occasions where a force builder could actually gain a pink lightsaber crystal a dentari lightsaber crystal also held a few special abilities within the crystal that would aid the wielder during the heat of a force battle or a lightsaber duel a dantori lightsaber crystal would actually collect straight force energy recycling that force energy back into the wielder meaning that the wielder of a dentari lightsaber crystal could fight far longer than is normal this also meant that the force itself was a little bit more prominent within a dantari lightsaber crystal if a dantari lightsaber crystal was used to its maximum degree the wielder of the crystal would not get tired as all the force energy that the wielder expelled would simply be recycled back into them thanks to the crystal and its special alignment with the wielder perhaps the most famous wielder of a dantari lightsaber crystal was jedi master mitra surik mitra zurich who would later go on to claim a yellow lightsaber but would later claim a blue lightsaber danteween was the place where most jedi acquired their lightsaber crystals before they discovered ilum and because ilum was a less threatening planet the jedi ultimately decided to move there however for those jedi that were adventurous and powerful they would venture to dantooine especially if they wanted to acquire a rare lightsaber crystal with pink and yellow being the most desirable that could be found there but what are your thoughts on the dantari lightsaber crystal and had you heard of it before this video also what are your thoughts on the properties of a dantari lightsaber crystal and its pink coloration thank you guys as always so much for watching don't forget to suggest more lightsabers and lightsaber crystals in the comments down below may they'll force me with you and have a great day [Music] [Applause] you", "Ysd424z8sQE": "[Music] that lightsaber it belongs to me welcome to watch mojo and today we're counting down our picks for the top 20 star wars lightsaber battles in movies and tv [Music] for this list we'll be looking at the coolest most epic lightsaber battles from across the star wars films and television series we'll only be including true lightsaber vs lightsaber duels so no lightsaber fights against other kinds of melee weapons or blasters let us know in the comments which of these is your favorite number 20. grievous versus six jedi star wars clone wars though it's often treated as the forgotten child of star wars media this 2003 micro series is a favorite of many fans developed and animated by samurai jack's gendy tartakovsky star wars clone wars pushed the boundaries of what the franchise could be one of the greatest gifts that it gave to fans was its treatment of general grievous the jedi killer while impressive on paper often feels quite silly in the way he's depicted both in revenge of the sith and the computer animated clone wars series i was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older general grievous you're shorter than i expected here however he's a formidable hunter and terrifying villain count him he's facing off against six jedi he tears them apart like a horror movie monster inspiring shock and fear in his victims despite their training number 19 obi-wan and asajj ventress versus darth maul and savage oppress star wars the clone wars anything more to say i like your new legs they make you look taller the clone wars gave us plenty of thrilling duels across its seven seasons but two-on-two battles always feel special plus there's just a certain novelty in watching obi-wan kenobi wield a red lightsaber i want that back that's fine red's not my color rarely have we seen quite so many crimson blades in the same space facing a formidable pair of foes and brothers darth maul and savage press obi-wan is forced to team up with adversary turned occasional ally asajj ventress the ensuing battle is brutal and lightning quick to the point that it's sometimes hard to keep track of whose lightsaber is whose it's a duel worthy of a season finale and darth maul's trash talk adds an extra emotional punch you master qui-gon jinn i gutted him while you stood helpless and watched how did that make you feel obi-wan it's not every day you see kenobi run from a fight number 18. kanan and ezra vs the grand inquisitor star wars rebels star wars rebels was quite a departure from the clone wars but it soon won the fanbase over with strong writing and scenes like this one [Music] taking place in a generator complex it's reminiscent of the phantom menace's confrontation between obi-wan qui-gon jinn and darth maul kanan kicks the duel off by using ezra's prototype lightsaber in unexpected ways from that point on the action does not let up [Music] at last a fight that might be worthy of my time when ezra gets his hands on a lightsaber to make it a two-on-one you'd expect the inquisitor to be rattled but he's totally unfazed quickly taking ezra out of the fight climactic full of neat lightsaber work and ending in dramatic fashion the stool helped solidify rebels place in star wars history number 17 mace windu vs darth sidious star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith are you threatening me master jedi as any serious star wars fan will tell you mace windu is a master of melee combat one of the most talented jedi to ever wield a lightsaber in fact he developed and perfected his own unique and aggressive style known as vapad we see his skills on display on geonosis where we got to see his amethyst blade master how pleasant of you to join us this party's over but it's during his confrontation with darth sidious that he really shows off his formidable abilities the battle begins with sidious cutting down three jedi in record time but the unflappable windu uses his unpredictable style to disarm his foe [Music] [Applause] [Music] if only anakin hadn't intervened [Music] number 16. finn and rey versus kylo ren star wars episode 7 the force awakens [Music] that lightsaber it belongs to me fans had been waiting a decade for another live-action duel when the force awakens came out the first time finn wields a lightsaber he struggles to hold his own against a riot trooper in the finale he does a little better against kylo ren but fights with more grit than skill this means it's up to ray to face off against darth vader's grandson [Music] it's a truly awesome moment when she force pulls anakin's lightsaber into her hands fans were a bit skeptical that ray managed to defeat kylo but hey kylo had just been shot all in all it was a thrilling duel that introduced fans to the lightsaber combat of the sequel trilogy more choreographed than the originals but less stylized than the prequels number 15 obi-wan vs darth vader star wars episode 4 a new hope sure in terms of choreography this duel can't hold a candle to those that followed it's stage fighting plain and simple what it lacks in wow factor however it makes up for in terms of emotional charge and nostalgia you can't win earth if you strike me down i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine this was the first time that we ever saw a lightsaber duel and that makes it historic it's also a reminder of the fact that lightsaber duels are about more than flips and fancy spins the stakes here are high and obi-wan's sacrifice is incredibly powerful [Music] in the years since the time we've spent with obi-wan and other media has only added to the significance of the moment number 14. rey vs kylo ren star wars episode 9 the rise of skywalker while rey and kylo trade blows several times throughout the sequel trilogy this is arguably their most satisfying duel rey is actually fighting like a jedi this time around and kylo isn't hampered by a blaster wound the atmosphere is all kinds of ominous and there's a good balance of force abilities and straightforward lightsaber combat [Music] by this point ray and kylo have a rather complicated relationship giving the exchange an emotional intensity plus there's just something epic about these characters duking it out on the wreckage of the death star especially considering their respective legacies number thirteen darth maul vs prix vizsla star wars the clone wars after having his potential cut short in the prequel films darth maul got a new lease on life in the clone wars animated series when maul challenges mandalorian warrior prix vizla to single combat the ensuing battle is all kinds of badass i challenge you one warrior to another and only the strongest shall rule mandalore so be it we've seen mandalorians fight jedi and sith alike and their prowess in combat is often enough to make up for a lack of force abilities what makes the duel such a pleasure to watch however is pre vizsla's use of the dark saber in conjunction with his more typical mandalorian arsenal maul and prix vizsla have fundamentally different fighting styles making it so that we never know what will happen next number 12 yoda vs count dooku star wars episode 2 attack of the clones master yoda count dooku it's a treat for viewers pretty much any time dooku pulls out a lightsaber though not always for him for years fans had salivated at the idea of finally seeing the great jedi master yoda in battle but we didn't think we'd ever get to see it until this epic matchup few fans predicted the acrobatics master yoda would employ to gain an advantage over his much larger opponent struggling in with a walking stick and looking small and weak he instead shows great strength and his outmatched adversary ultimately flees this is just the beginning [Music] number 11. anakin vs asajj ventress star wars clone wars [Music] asajj ventress was initially designed by the art department for episode 2 but she didn't actually make her debut until the first animated clone wars series sidious instructs her to kill anakin hoping to use her to test anakin's skills their duel takes them through the jungles of yavin 4 and into the ruins of masasi temples with fast-paced mid-air combat as well as more deliberate face-to-face moments this altercation has it all including a dramatic ending once asajj ventress is defeated an enraged anakin stands on the edge of a dark abyss holding a red-bladed lightsaber a chilling foreshadowing of events to come number 10 darth maul and savage oppress versus obi-wan and addie galia star wars the clone wars what do you get when you combine two sith and two jedi well one dead jedi apparently when this bout begins things seem relatively evenly matched but before long it becomes clear that that is not at all the case when maul's older brother and addie golia separate and face off it's one of the quickest and most one-sided affairs in lightsaber history managing to hold her own with him for mere moments after an ineffective kick she meets her end when she is literally stabbed in the back [Music] number nine darth sidious vs sauvage oppress and darth maul star wars the clone wars the dathomirian brothers make our list again this time when they team up against darth sidious i sense a presence a presence i haven't felt since master now that maul has his own army his former master sees him as a potential rival maul pretends that he's still loyal but really he's out for blood and sidious knows it this was arguably maul's best chance for revenge against sidious but despite the aid of his brother sidious remains in control throughout the dark lord kills savage and laughs about it maul throws himself into the fight but to no avail the duel shows off the extent of the emperor's true strength and you can't help but feel from all as he grieves his brother number eight obi-wan versus general grievous star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith hello there we know what you're thinking how isn't a duel featuring a four-armed cyborg with lightsabers in each hand higher up in the list that just goes to show how many kick-ass saber contests there have been each weapon the general possesses signifies a jedi he defeated so the deck is definitely stacked against our hero obi-wan especially with grievous's propeller-like blade action keeping him at bay but once he begins to disarm the general of his weapons literally the tide starts to turn oh i don't think so [Music] mind you he does have to resort to a blaster to end the fight number 7 yoda vs darth sidious star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith faith in your new apprentice misplaced maybe as is your faith in the dark side of the force when the empire struck back in 1980 and we met yoda for the first time it became clear to fans that he was the light side counterpart to the evil emperor however the idea of seeing the two come to blows never seemed possible but when episode 3 came out 25 years later we finally got a face to face showdown yes it's a cgi bonanza and having yoda insidious resort to lightsabers at all divided fans but it's still an epic confrontation to decide the fate of the galaxy [Music] we got to see them duel again in the season 6 finale of the clone wars although sadly this was just a vision still it was an amazing battle that featured yoda having to make some momentous choices number six ahsoka vs darth vader star wars rebels watching a newly blinded kanan tangle with darth maul in the rebels season 2 finale was definitely satisfying but this episode also gave us arguably rebels most powerful moment the reunion between an apprentice and her fallen master revenge is not the jedi way i am no jedi seeing ahsoka realize anakin's fate is truly heartbreaking as they cross sabres vader's sheer power is awe-inspiring but so too is ahsoka's mastery over her weapons there may be no jedi's here as ahsoka makes clear but their incredible skills different styles and long personal history make this duel stand out i won't leave you not this time [Music] [Music] then you will die number five luke versus darth vader star wars episode six return of the jedi the fastest paced exchange from the original trilogy this fight was punctuated by the calm conversation that takes place between the combatants and their lone spectator however the scene was never about the action though there are some great examples of that use your aggressive feelings boy no what we love most about this battle is the palpable tension and emotion that's been building over the course of three movies finally coming to an end the reveal that vader's hand is also cybernetic is perhaps the simplest yet most compelling and symbolic part of the entire sequence never i'll never turn to the dark side number four ahsoka vs darth maul star wars the clone wars the seventh and final season of star wars the clone wars delivered the sort of ending that the series deserved it also gave us arguably the best lightsaber duel in the history of the show [Music] as she confronts maul ahsoka clings onto her faith in anakin unwilling to believe that he could turn to the dark side if this fight felt even more gritty and visceral than usual you can thank stunt woman lauren mary kim and darth maul actor ray park who provided the motion capture performances you're lucky anakin didn't show up the way you're fighting you wouldn't have lasted long the choreography is beautiful the scoring is cinematic and the banter is on point it's a two-part duel that would have been worthy of the big screen this is the clone wars at its best and most polished number three luke vs darth vader star wars episode 5 the empire strikes back the force is with you young skywalker but you are not a jedi yet this duel saw luke test out his newfound skills against vader and find out the truth about his father the stakes couldn't be higher with han kidnapped in the rebellion on its back foot as hero and villain face off the visuals of them shrouded in smoke and shadow the glow of their lightsabers swinging back and forth is exhilarating and frightening all at once slow paced and methodical vader seems to be toying with his younger and less trained foe it culminates in a stunning reveal and defeat for the good guys but we wouldn't change a single thing about it there is no escape don't make me destroy you number two qui-gon and obi-wan vs darth maul star wars episode 1 the phantom menace when episode 1 was released many star wars fans left theaters feeling dissatisfied but there was one new addition that most loved darth maul athletic agile and just downright cool looking maul was a sith lord unlike anything we'd seen before we first glimpsed his battle prowess as he dueled qui-gon on tatooine but this was just a taste of what was to come [Music] his fight against qui-gon and obi-wan showed us what a lightsaber duel could look like in the heyday of the jedi the choreography is incredible and qui-gon's fate is burned into our memories not to mention obi-wan's final move [Music] the duel would lead to a long-lasting rivalry that only ended in star wars rebels i've come to kill you but perhaps it's worse to leave you here festering in your squaller before we unveil our most epic number one pick here are a few honorable mentions sabine vs gar saxon star wars rebels [Music] anakin vs count dooku star wars episode 2 attack of the clones ahsoka and luminara versus ventress star wars the clone wars [Music] anakin vs barris offi star wars the clone wars should have gotten rid of them i think they suit me obi-wan and anakin vs

sith only a sith deals in absolutes i will do what i must you will try it doesn't get better than this epic and emotionally charged this contest between a teacher and his pupil is by far the largest in scope of the entire series the whole prequel trilogy was building to this moment when these two former friends turn on one another between strikes obi-wan pleads for anakin to see the error of his ways despite knowing deep down that it's too late for that [Music] in the end anakin's hubris is his ultimate undoing it's over anakin i have the high ground unable to overcome kenobi he ends up crippled and badly burned filled with hate and pain it's the making of an iconic villain it was said that you would destroy this sin not join them bring balance to the forest not leave it in darkness do you agree with our picks check out this other recent clip from watchmojo and be sure to subscribe and ring the bell to be notified about our latest videos", "U0pNGRmbRs4": "we need to talk about something real quick actually this probably won't be very quick i need to really talk about this this is something that i did not want to have to do this is a video i did not want to have to make this is a video that i've already done in the past with a different company and i hate doing this because it puts me through the ringer and it puts my viewers through the ringer and it leaves a negative stain on me and on the saber community and i hate having to do it but i really feel the need to do it now because there's been a massive influx of people into the saber community over the past year or two years and with that comes scammers with that comes bad apples with that becomes total jerks and people that genuinely could care less about other people and only want money and power and fame and attention and all that kind of stuff so i wanted to talk about this because people have told me that i that this is a personal vendetta for me to to go out of my way to attack this company to go out of my way to attack this person and i don't think it is because if i don't do my part in warning people in the saber community with the platform that i have and i believe that i have a platform that is far reaching and can reach more people than the average person the saber community if i don't do my part the platform that i have to make sure that people are actually doing the right thing with their money that are actually not supporting these bad businesses that are actually not getting scammed if i don't do my part in saving those people from those people then what am i doing i'm just only showing the positive side of the safer community and i'm not showing the negative side i'm only showing you know the saber trios of the world that you know do everything right and i'm not showing the people that are scamming people on a large scale that are lying to people on a large scale that are manipulating people on a large scale if i'm not showing you both sides of the coin then i'm doing it wrong and that's why i'm taking it so personal that this is my personal vendetta against paul do gramsci jr and dx sabres this isn't a personal vendetta for me this is me trying to protect you know the 15 year olds the 16 year olds that saved up money to buy a savior this is me protecting the parents of those kids who bought them a saber for christmas and never got it or what or that were lied to this is me protecting you know as much as i hate to say it the tick tockers the cosplayers these people that don't know anything about the saber community that are being scammed that are being lied to that are being manipulated by paul by dx sabers if i don't do anything to protect those people then they're going to be scammed they're going to leave the community and they're going to hate the community for it because they didn't do enough research they didn't do whatever and i get that people don't do enough research for everything people get scammed by these hacker websites and these scam websites all the time that happens every single day every single month every single year that happens all the time but the lightsaber community is a very niche thing and there are ways to pick out these scams and people have picked out these scams they have dissected these scams and this dude is the definition of this game he's a loser and this isn't defamation of character like dx savers is gonna say he's gonna probably call me something that i'm not going to say because it's going to get me demonetized and probably banned from youtube he's going to call me something that i'm going to show you in a second that he's called other people of the saber community this dude is a bum he is lying to you everything he does is a lie sure he may have products and people may have actually ordered from him and gotten products but that's not the point that is not the point he's lying to you about the origin of the product what the true price of the product should be where he got the product where the product is coming from this dude is lying so if you're unaware of the sabre community and i've talked about this before on my channel with other companies there's a company called lgt saber studio based in china and their chinese mass producing sabre company probably the or if not the one of the biggest lightsaber communities in the world because they produce so many savers in terms of pure volume they are one of if not the biggest lightsaber community in the world most people don't know about them in the states because they're not in china they don't know about chinese lightsaber companies because they've they've never looked into them they'll buy something off of you know saber trio they buy something off of corbin or vader's fault they'll never know with what lgt is but lgt provides these sabres so crimson dawn dark wolf fire savers rebel sabers those are all lgt saber studio sabres every single one of them dark wolf is lgt's direct united states partner and they helped develop the boards so if you bought a profit neopixel saber from dark wolf then it'll say dark wolf lgt on the profit board itself but guess what dx sabres what he used to do is buy those sabers from lgt resell them and then call them his own which is not cool lgt saber studio does not like that and in fact because he did that for so long lgt saber studio cut them off so i'm going to read what pat gibbons the business consultant of lgt saber studio said about this and i've posted this before on a community post so don't worry if you want to skip this part whatever over the past year lgt employees and agents have received many comments screenshots reviews and links showing interactions that customers and other vendors have had with dx savers llc and owner operator paul dogranji jr many of these interactions have included claims concerning customer service legal disputes the origin and distribution of products product designs and even lgt as a company concerning our partnerships and ownership this statement is being released to clarify and more importantly define the position of damien tech ltd damien zoo or zhu is the owner of lgt saber studio and lgt saber studio in regards to the growing concerns from the saber community and general public prior to the statement dx sabres llc was a vendor who sold and distributed lgt products as well as other manufacturers products dx sabres was not entered into any exclusive partnership or agreement and they did not design produce or modify lgt products in any way outside of possible installation dx sabers did not and does not have any controlling stake or ownership of our products design staff or facilities so that means and everyone knew this already anyone in the cyber community who knew any sort of inkling of knowledge about lgt saber studio and their sabres knew that these resellers they don't make the products they resell them and i've talked about that before crimson dark wolf fire sabers rebel they resell the products they're cool with lgt all those four companies that i just mentioned lgt's legit with them they love them i mean they sell their products they're reliable they're really nice people dx savers is not effective immediately we're severing ties to dx sabers on all forms of business dxabers will no longer be a direct supplier of lgt products please note it is entirely possible that dx sabres may have remaining stock of some lgt products which they have rights to sell or dispense as they see fit this termination of agreement was made by the ceo of lgt saber studio damien zhu on advice from myself as lgt's business consultant and signed off by the company stakeholders and lgt's product development partner johnny collado from custom darwolf sabres so i've mentioned in the past dark wolf is the partner of lgt saber studio and they help develop the boards and stuff johnny colado is a really nice guy please note that this termination also applies to dark wolf sound boards and other proprietary products from lgt damien tech or that mention lgt saber studio and dark wolf sabres soundboards meaning that lgt saber studio and dark wolf on their profit boards and on other boards and stuff that they have on their sabers it says dark wolf and lgt saber studio on it and dx sabres keep selling the products that it says dark wolf and lgt saber studio on it if you buy a dx saber that's a profit neopixel saber open it up look at the board it says dark wolf lgt they don't have permission to sell that so the scam goes even further any products purchased from dx sabres in the future that appear to be lgt will be either remaining stock as of the statement or products purchased from a vendor to be resold and are not authorized by lgt we understand that many of you may have questions concerning lgt's decision in this matter however we feel at this time the information provided will suffice blah blah blah blah lgt saber studio has grown significantly in many ways over the last few years and our products and vendors are improving in quality and reputation respectively as all of our vendors know direct misrepresentation of yourself or lgt is not tolerated we certainly are patient with our distributors as we urge them to become more transparent but blatantly deceiving and providing false information to the saber community or the public in general does not align with lgt's values or our growing commitment to quality and accountability we have a responsibility to our customers we feel they have a right to know that we hear their voices and truly appreciate them blah blah blah so like i said pat gibbons is lgg's business consultant and lgt saber studio themselves actually reposted this on their official page this is official this is legitimate this isn't just some random guy that says oh i'm part of lgt and i'm making this statement no this is legitimate this is totally legitimate and trust me i've talked to pat gibbons he's a nice guy and he's totally legit and he's provided me with information that very much includes the information that you need to know that this dude is legit this is an official statement from lgt saber studio that cut off dx sabres on december 27 2020 that was over a month ago and after the statement came out obviously paul from dx sabres lied about it says oh no this is some random guy saying stuff like that he's not anyone anyone can make a statement like that and just say that they work for a rival company which leads me to believe that dx sabres is so caught up in their own lie that they don't even realize that lgt saber studio isn't a rival company it is the company that you are stealing from and lying about you're taking their products selling it as your own and calling it your own saying that you made it which is a direct misrepresentation of lgt's products like pat gibbons said like lgt saber studios said so since then since that statement came out dx sabres denied deny denied said blah blah blah whatever this is a random guy he isn't anything he's just some random guy then people kept calling him out oh lgt saber studio blah blah blah they're doing whatever they're they're they're not anything oh we're not really we're not we don't know anything about them i make my sabers he released an apology video got deleted can't see it anymore god if anyone has that video please send it to me if you downloaded that video because god is disgusting the video is horrible any legitimate saber company that has to make an apology video or that has to make a video saying that they're legitimate is not legitimate you don't need to do that if you're a legitimate company because your work speaks for itself and his work does not speak for itself because he doesn't do any work you're not an installer you're not a manufacturer you don't have a lathe you don't have a mill you don't have a warehouse you don't have an office you have your own house you probably sit in your home office or in your kitchen buy these sabers from a chinese company repackage them in your house ship them off and you think that you're you know the the best saber company in the world when you're not he does nothing absolutely nothing but repackage the boxes and you can tell that he does this because these sabers can be bought in bulk from alibaba or ali express anyone can do that lgt's cut him off so they can't so he can't buy from lgt anymore so now what he does is he partners with ydd and 89 savers now ydd they provide stuff that you'll see stuff like uh like kybers and all that kind of stuff the stuff that's on amazon usually those are ydd sabers the older models of ydd sabers and you'll see stuff from the poc store that is from ydd savers now 89 savers i have 89 savers products i mean this is an 89 savers product my graphics supreme that's an 89 savers product 89 sabres products are legitimate but their owner is a snake he's scammed people multiple times i've told you all a million times don't buy directly from 89 sabres and what does he do partners with dx savers it just goes to show that there are way more snakes there are way more losers in the saber community than you think there are and there are people that are in positions of power and i'm talking about power i mean lgt ydd 89 savers they have a massive influence on the saber market way bigger than you think if you took them away you're taking away a lot of products off the saber market from core banff buy and resell 89 sabres products there are a lot of companies out there you know sabre bay 89 sabres a lot of people on etsy 89 sabres ydd lgt and there's a lot of people out there that are buying and reselling these savers from ydd and 89 sabres and lgt now there are legitimate resellers and partners dark wolf crimson dawn fire sabers rebels savers kyber etch i mean there's a lot of legitimate people but there's also a ton of illegitimate people there's a ton of people that are actual scammers that know nothing about lightsabers they're buying these things they took out a bank loan they bought all this stuff from china they're just gonna resell it at a marked up price you know two to three times what they bought it for and then they get a return on their investment it's you know going to say that it's that sort of reselling mantra that that reselling motive is immoral a little wishy-washy because you know there are a lot of people that are just trying to make money i mean they found something they're good at marketing or something and they're just trying to make money and they're good at what they do but there's also a lot of people that care less about lightsabers they could care less about the lightsaber community they just want the money there are a lot of people out there that literally don't know the first thing about building lightsabers first thing about designing lightsabers first thing about fixing lightsabers and that's people like this people like dx savers he doesn't know anything he's never designed a saber on his own ever ever the draw-ups that he's posted all that stuff is fake he's never designed a saber that he sold ever never lgt has proof of that ydd 89 sabres they have proof of that they've even said ydd and 89 sabers who are now dx sabers suppliers they've even said those are our products and everyone knows that anyone who knows what ydd is anyone who's owned a 89 savers product they know what the product is but do the people know that are on tick tock and on instagram and on twitter and wherever no they probably don't because they just watch the star wars movie they just watch the mandalorian they just watch clone wars or something they watch something star wars related they saw something on youtube and they're gonna go and look up lightsabers and they'll only find a few things one of those being dx sabers and they will be heartbroken if paul sends a faulty product and will charge you to fix it even though you know most legitimate saber companies have warranties but because he doesn't make his own products and he doesn't know how to fix his own products he would have to ship it all the way back to china to get fixed all the way back to you and he doesn't do that because he's not legit his dude is a scammer and ydd and 89 sabres they they're aware of what paul does they're aware of what dx sabres has done in the past and they don't care because just like the x sabers they just want the money they don't care paul pays them so why in that business relationship this goes on you know everywhere i mean this i mean massive businesses not just the lightsaber community and this happens everywhere in society businesses partnering with other businesses just because they're i mean they're all scummy and scamming businesses this happens all the time but this is a lightsaber community something that i have a vested interest in something that people have had a vested interest in for 44 years i mean this is awful and if i don't tell you about this if i don't show you this stuff then what are we doing here i mean i want people to like this community i want people to enjoy buying lightsabers i want people to enjoy collecting lightsabers but there are people like paul from dx sabres that ruin it for everyone they ruined credibility they ruin the community for people people get scammed once they leave the community never looking back and that's terrible so let's just talk about this guy dx sabers for a second let's just talk about paul from dx savers so one of the main issues that people have and i know lgt had and that's one of the main reasons why they cut them off is that everything paul sells go look at his instagram it's disgusting everything he sells he says only at dx savers no it is not only a dx sabres for example the wonderful savers twin sons have discussed this in the past the wonderful sabre's twin sons come from nigel from wonderful sabers nc prop shop it's the only place you can get them wonderful sabres twin sons so dx sabers thought it'd be cool if he just stole the photos and tried to pass it off as his own say that hey these are my savers i drew these up and then um people called him out on that lied said that oh um they're not your designs you didn't copyright them no it's fine it doesn't matter i don't care still kept the photos up still was lying to people saying you know i have these these are my sabers i designed them no you didn't so for example let's take a look at that real quick so let's take a look at that real quick this isn't my these aren't my screenshots these are screenshots that i've pulled this is someone that dm'd dx sabres hey i saw your ahsoka tracings any prototypes to show can i ask why now what saber company when someone asks hey can i see savers that you made can i ask why and can i ask if you follow the saber community that is clearly indicative of a liar trying not to get caught person says i generally place pre-orders only if i know that there's a feasible physical product that i like i haven't seen any of your actual product other than photos of drawings and they asked what community they said cool send them a picture this picture right here that dx saber scent it's hard to see because it's not the cropped screenshot but this is from wonder world sabers this is on dx haber's website right here they changed it because they know too many people called them out about it but it's still called the fulcrum tonno on their website they just use different pictures now but this is the product that they're trying to sell and guess what it's exactly what i have in my hand oh my gosh it's almost as if the examples is lying which they are wonderful sabers very disappointed to see dx sabers using my twin sons to advertise as sabres i would speak out but we know he will just deny the 999 and claim he designed them which is exactly what he did after this is nigel's sabres as you can see right here in the background of this photo stuff's in chinese paul doesn't speak chinese or mandarin paul probably cannot read that paul doesn't have a factory in china where he gets people to take pictures of of the products for him paul is in king of prussia pennsylvania at his house lying to people lying to people thinking that oh oh i have a factory here in philly i got a factory in shenzhen china no you don't you don't have anything you have your house so let's talk more about dx sabres so let's look at dx savers real quick dx savers let's go let's take a look at them let's go to the about page of dx sabres uh our business partners hmm what is this uh what is what is that that's a youtube video that has nothing to do with dxa residual pipe drive don't really care ultimate works if you know anything about the box store you know about ultimate works but what is this soar quantify that's kind of strange let's see what that is so if you go to paul's linkedin profile paul dokramji jr founder cxo at dx sabres inside sales league legend i come from aggressive retail sales and cold calling selling loose leaf tea no one ever needs in loyalty programs blah blah experience founder cxodx savers founder cxo soar inc founder cxo vpo games which used to be listed as one of his partners on the dx savers website this guy is a scammer look at this our business partners your own company as your business partner you're the only you're the company that you created these two companies right here and there used to be more and he deleted them off the website the companies that you created are your business partners no they're not they're scams that you set up to try to make your website look more legitimate which it is not it is not legitimate so let's take a look his disclaimer right here dx sabres is not affiliated with disney or hasbro or its affiliates blah blah blah and lucasfilm products all right reserve so what that means is when you say that you're not affiliated with disney or hasbro or lucasfilm that means that you cannot use copyrighted names or trademark names let's go to shop let's see a skywalker legacy hmm that's strange that's really strange jedi can't use that name dathomir that's a planet created by dave filoni can't use that name when you're selling stuff now let's see let's see where the replica sabers are let's see what he starts calling them uh republic revan you can't use the name right when you're selling sabres kenobi legacy can't use that name skywalker maul kenobi starkiller fisto skywalker darksaber revan gin leia kestis ahsoka you can't use those names when you're selling sabres and saber companies know this they create new names you know fulcrum or they you know twin sons or something like that you can't use full character names or the name star wars in any aspect of your saber company especially not if you say in your mission statement in your about statement that you are not affiliated with disney or hasbro or lucasfilm blah blah blah blah dx sabers has obtained permission to use and distribute photos used from all from the owners of all photographers seen here or anywhere else dx savers is affiliated with or owned and operated now if that was the case then why did they steal photos from lgt saber studios on aliexpress why did they steal photos of wonderful sabers twin sons now look this is a screenshot he removed these photos but this is a screenshot from his website this screenshot was from dx sabres obtain permission to use and distribute photos using my twin sons to advertise as sabres no you did not obtain permission customers may request for refunds before shipment within legitimate reason and may not receive their refund until after they receive their item once the item is received a return may be requested within reason if it just if a customer is discovered being untruthful in any of their requests all refund requests moving forward shall be denied without reason now this is a typical scam tactic that you see in the lightsaber community you cancel your order for whatever reason you know you can't afford it or you know you're moving or you know you find out they're a scam or something like that you request a refund saber company never gets back to you 10 days later or something like that they ship the item out you receive it and you still don't have your refund because they ignored your refund request and they're not giving you your money back it's exactly what they're saying right here dx sabres llc will always act in the best interest of the customer as well as the business but will not allow the company to be abused through policy manipulation dramatic emotional verbal abuse increased pressure to increased priority over other customers cyber bullying or any other similar action related to the previously stated my god always act in the best interest of the customer as well as the business let me scroll up so you can see that dx savers will always act in the best interest of the customer as well as the business are you kidding me let's see if dx sabers always acts in the best interest of the customer let's take a look so this is an example of a screenshot from not too long ago this is an instagram story from dx sabres announcement we are not with lgt anymore we have made moves to become better company our lead times whatever please bear with us for a small business so this picture that he blocked off you know three quarters of looks to be like a factory or something like that but the thing is dx sabers doesn't have a factory at all this photo is an old photo of aliexpress stock from lgt saber studio and that was confirmed by lgt saber studio this is a stolen photograph that dx sabers use this was what two three weeks ago something like that this is a stolen photograph that dx sabres used to try to try to increase his you know legitimacy somehow this is fake this is another company's factory that he has a picture of and try to use an instagram story to increase legitimacy that's disgusting that is i mean he's a snake that is a serious low balling so going back to what he said about uh you know his company so this soar company right here this quantify company that you see on his linkedin is his own company soar sales optimizations dx sabres is a hard-working small family business by paul doguramji right at the onset of covet 19's outbreak many small businesses began to rise as many started to fall in every city in the world one of those small businesses is dx sabres a small lightsaber forging company that makes and sells custom and non-custom lightsabers huh so paul created these other companies so sales optimizations and marketing is like with these other companies that he created or created these other companies to try to increase the legitimacy of his scam lightsaber company and on that website that he created this company soar says one of those small businesses is dx sabres a small lightsaber forging company that makes and sells custom and non-custom lightsabers now correct me if i'm wrong but forging means to create so i'm not sure how you create something and in this case creating lightsabers not sure how you create lightsabers that someone else made i don't know how that's possible that makes and sells custom and non-customizing it doesn't make anything though not a single thing on this entire website is actually made by dx savers nothing nothing at all for example this right here that looks like a crimson dawn strike to me i know because i have one which is an lgc cyber studio product but look that's the t38 from crimson dawn also an lgt saber studio the crimson dawn shade also an lgt saber studio product the crimson on banshee also an lgt saber studio product i mean i don't know why people think that this is legit i genuinely don't know the only thing on this website that paul may have actually had any sort of hand in all the way at the bottom an official dx saber shirt that's it that's the only thing he has done designed this polo the shirt and the hoodie those are the only things on this entire website that he may have actually designed that's it not a single other thing on this website by the way all these helmets that he's selling for 150 bucks you can get for twenty dollars from uh the aliexpress store from thailand 150 bucks for something that's actually worth twenty dollars this isn't metal you know this isn't no legitimate this is cheap plastic that's being sold on aliexpress that is charging you 150 dollars for so you know just something i wanted to mention this is all fake you know he stole these photos so you know this sith trooper dx helmet that picture right there this picture right here this picture right here this picture right here all these photos right here these helmets are stolen from aliexpress and now you know correct me if i'm wrong maybe maybe i just read this wrong let me see let me read it one more time um let's see oh uh dx sabres has obtained permission to use and distribute photos used from the owners of all photographers seen here or anywhere else dx sabres is affiliated with are owned and operated that's strange because you know i think any company would say no you don't have permission to use and distribute my photos when you're selling my products for seven and a half times more expensive than what i sell it that's absurd that's very absurd this is a blatant lie dx sabres has not obtained permission to use and distribute the photos from these other companies this picture how i mean how can you get permission to use a photo of ian mcdarmond as emperor palpatine you don't because you never reached out to lucasfilm disney to get permission these photos aren't his these are screenshots from videos you can tell because this finger is moving in the picture you can tell because it's blurry on his instagram let's see let's go find his instagram real quick because i'm i'm really tired of this dude let's go find his instagram real quick and let's take a look at what he what he's been doing so if you go to his instagram dx sabers with a z you can go and look not logged in so it won't let me click on these pictures but go look at his pictures and go look at these photos of these sabers and how blurry they are they're like blurry and super zoomed in the reason behind that is because they're not as pictures he stole them from other saber companies on aliexpress on etsy or their main stores or whatever he stole them cropped them made them lower quality so you can't see the watermark that these other saber companies have on the photos and what he's done since then is stuff like this so you go back to his website you start looking at his pictures and then you'll see some stuff let me try to find one of them because it's so stupid this one for example right here official dx sabres use only this isn't his photo he doesn't have permission to show these photos he doesn't have permission to sell things using these photos this guy is a scammer he is lying to you and these tick talkers and these people that are being manipulated and the worst part about it is that he's using people that have such a large platform to cooperate in his schemes i've seen people on instagram they have like 20 000 followers 15 000 followers that are partnering with dx sabers he scammed michelle c smith who's like a stunt woman he's like legitimate with lightsabers you see her on youtube she's partnered with dx savers ray park who is actually darth maul literally darth maul in phantom menace the live-action darth maul that is ray park ray park was also in solo as maul this guy is the physical embodiment of darth maul in star wars literally the real star wars in partnering with dx sabres i i just i i genuinely don't understand why this guy is going to such lengths to increase his legitimacy when he has none none this guy doesn't make a single thing he sells nothing at all none of those sabers those are made by other hard-working people in a different continent that he's taking credit for because he thinks no one's going to notice because he thinks no one cares because he thinks it's funny to scam people to lie to people because he thinks it's cool because he thinks it's the right thing to do because he's a small family business trying to make his way during the pandemic there are other ways to run a small business during a pandemic and to provide for your family and lying about lightsaber toys and who made them is not the way to do it now a lot of you people may know who saber sourcing is she is a wonderful resource for the saber community she did an expose on dx sabres and let's take a look at that so let's take a look at sabre sourcing and what she had to say about dx sabres so blah blah blah it's just some background info who runs dx sabres according to the etsy store paul doguerami jr aka the dark jedi which is as alias he used to escape blame additionally dx sabre's website states that dx works with chris lee damien zhu and vera jones and makio tuang ceo of ydd sabres now this was from may of 2020 this was blatantly dx sabres did not work with any of these people he bought their products and resold them as his own this is in the mission statement so this is this is still on their website which is absurd we started this company because we are tired of other companies profiting so hard off of these awesome lightsabers we are bringing affordable and super well-made lightsabers to the marketplace so that everyone can afford the lightsaber of their dreams the dark jedi founder and ceo we started this company because we're tired of other companies profiting so hard off of these awesome lightsabers now correct me if i'm wrong but someone can't profit off of something that doesn't exist so if dx sabres makes these sabers like he claims and has claimed for a year then how can other companies profit off of them they can't so his own mission statement is an admittance of guilt and contradicts what he says that only at dx sabre's talk on every single instagram post that he makes contradicts his own website's mission statement how can other companies profit so hard off these sabres if you're the one that made them you didn't make them other companies made them and been selling them for years and you decide to jump on the train and you're jealous that other companies are making money so you decide to jump on the train jack up the prices and get your profit margins right what a loser dx saber sells a selection of hilt designs that are made in china including products from lgt sabres and ydd savers a lot of us already know that some of the photos used originate from different companies exactly everyone already knows that dx sabres has been banned from the our lightsaber subreddit our lightsaber subreddit is the biggest online lightsaber community in the world it's about to hit 100 000 members dx sabres facebook recommendations facebook reviews three of the march 2020 reviews are made by facebook profiles using a stock photo of a person or a photo of a person posted elsewhere on the internet according to the federal trade commission that is illegal you cannot create fake reviews i've called out a company before in the past about using fake reviews it's not cool and it's illegal and it carries a massive fine now this is one of the most disgusting aspects of dx savers sophie sabres foundation the dx sabres website states that every purchase of the master ray lightsaber will donate a portion to sophie saber's foundation the money gets put into account that sophie's parents can use to spend on her bills fun times blah blah blah the dx sabres website states that sophie's sabers foundation is registered with irs and u.s government as a non-profit organization blah blah blah blah basically very very very vaguely as you can see here sophie is a very special little girl the unfortunate burden of fighting cancer here we go blatant lie for a charity organization sophie is a very special little girl who has an unfortunate burden of fighting cancer in its serious stages and she was the first to have us create the ray skywalker lightsaber from the end of rise of skywalker it is factually proven that dx sabers has not created a single lightsaber that they have ever sold ever and at the point of at the time of this lgt and ydd was supplying them i guarantee you and and pat gibbons from lgt has already confirmed this dx sabres has never made a special agreement with lgt to make any sabers ever she was the first to have us create the ray skywalker lightsaber from the enterprise of skywalker the money gets put into an account that sylvia's parents can use to spend under bills blah blah blah blah you created nothing you are lying in a mission statement for a charity for a girl who has cancer so let's go back to the saber sourcing article because she did a lot of incredible research on this so on may 7 2020 the dx savers facebook page posts that the ein number for sophie sabres foundation is 85-090-5941 you go to the irs tax-exempt organization search did not return any results as you can see here dx sabers posted something i already checked this multiple times so let's do it again let's just let's just try it again so let's copy that let's go to the tax exempt organization search let's paste search nothing this is not only is that tax fraud it's incredibly immoral because you're using a child with cancer to get money for something that you didn't create that's horrible dx saber's lightsaber arm attachment dx sabers post an image of lightsaber arm attachments on their facebook page if you want a lightsaber arm attachment for people who have prosthetics then reach out to us as we can make them custom just for your arm that's not true because dick sabers doesn't make anything at that time they were buying and reselling stuff from lgt and ydd who did not make these the photo is from reddit user eatpreynub i've seen him on the r lightsaber subreddit before when asked if eatpreynov gave dx saber's permission to use the photo he said we did not and i've just submitted a copyright claim via facebook and instagram the lightsaber arm attachment adapter was designed by myself and a friend at the bionics company oh sir then machine by sabreforge to fit the adaptive saver parts are you serious so first you lie about a child with cancer then you lie about an amputee and what you did for them are you serious that is scum of the earth behavior dx sabers threatened to sue saber sourcing for posting this article call or court you have no idea how much in violation of the law you are and we expect this article to take down immediately or you'll be hearing from my attorney this is public information this is all public information all of this stuff on this article every single thing on this article i mean look at the article look at the name of the article the example is what we know about the company is custom savers that's not defamation that's not slander that's not libel which he doesn't know the difference of what any of that stuff means his lawyer even told him to shut up on facebook after he kept running his mouth everything on this article that sabre sourcing posted every single thing is public information that can be found in facebook on instagram on reddit on dxaber's website i mean this is all public information you can't sue someone for public information that it is your fault is out there that's like if i did something illegal and i said oh you can't report on it news reporter you can't rep you can't report on that that's defamation no it's not it's public information and that's what i'm doing with this video so paul you can you can try to sue me for defamation all you want you're gonna get nowhere you have never reached out to your da's office like you said multiple times and threatened people on facebook for i called your da's office you're a nobody you're a nobody you're a lying manipulator who is a nobody you have no power over anyone else your attorney is not serving subpoenas your attorney is not filing lawsuits nobody's done anything to you to warrant a lawsuit they're calling out your illegal behavior your immoral behavior on the internet which is a public forum that people have freedom of speech on you know what you don't have freedom of speech on paul stuff like this this is a review on their facebook sky's a scam artist pictures on etsy aren't even as pictures also the sabers themselves are not made or designed by dx sabers i've already proved that they're designed by lgt saber studio and ydd purchased them for very low and sold them for three times an amount blah blah blah the chinese company is blacklisted for the horrible service i've already showed you all that that's the thing with pat gibbons right here this that's the chinese company blacklisting i was screwed over 500 have a case open with etsy ignore me for over two weeks blah blah blah dx savers look what he says right here i'm not going to repeat this i'm not going to repeat the words that he says read that let me zoom in a little further so you can read what he says this person is from a what our lawyers are handling this please stay away from them this person is from a what i don't believe so i don't i don't think so and i don't think you can say that this is an official business profile on facebook now imagine if ford or chevy somebody posted a review or something like this so for example let's say ford came out with a truck and it was the chevy silverado and ford tried to sell it as their own and said no we made that they just took the chevy badge off and put a ford one on there that's not your truck and then someone went to a review site and said that's a scam they don't they didn't make that truck that's a chevy silverado and then ford came out and said none of this is true this person how can you how can you say that that's victim blaming and lying this person is not one of these people this is an honest review screwed over 500 have a case with etsy there is more than enough proof of dx sabres doing this kind of stuff more than enough proof this is just a small inkling now in a previous instagram comment still waiting for the soka order put in a month ago i know honestly it's taking so long because lgt is taking a long time to ship them to us we are waiting just like you are and we will get them to you asap now paul if if you made your own sabers and they're only a dx sabers why would lgt be shipping you sabers i thought you made them yourself huh that's strange it's almost as if you're contradicting everything because you're you're so deep in your own lies that you don't even realize when you're not lying you don't even realize that you that you slipped up there are too many lies out there for you to remember it's horrible so for example this one right here genuinely curious whatever happened to the clone wars ahsoka sabres waiting for photos who would you get photos from besides lgt actually you're a spy for the saber communities you've been blacklisted really i mean this is the kind of stuff that he pulls daily it's horrible it is so bad is spy for the saber communities and you're on the outside of the saber community i wonder why you've been blacklisted from every sabre community dx abras our lightsaber subreddit which is the largest online lightsaber community in the world lightsaber market everyone it you're banned and for good reason because you're a lying manipulator you've been blacklisted you're aspire for the saber communities no legitimate member of the saber community asking questions from a scammer scammer gets caught you've been blacklisted shocking now let's take a look at this comment i'm not going to read any of that you can take a look at it community has now been labeled as what police and will be put on a da's radar come on the organization yeah this is a lie i contacted the da's office like i said paul you're nobody they don't know who you are you're nobody the lightsaber community is not on the da's radar trust me i know for a fact you're a liar your manipulator if anything you're the one that's going to get sued for defamation you can't call people this you can't call people that on the internet with your business profile you want to create a burner account and call people that fine i don't care but you're a business you're a registered business and you're calling people this now imagine if nike adidas ford chevy apple imagine if they on their social media started calling people this what would happen canceled all kinds of stuff would happen trust me it would not go over well but because this dude sells toy lightsabers he gets to get away with it i don't know about that i don't know about that so this is just a very small inkling of the things that paul from dx sabres has done if you see him say only a dx sabres it's a lie it's a lie i mean there's ample ample evidence to back up the fact that it's not at only dx savers it is not that ydd say the same sabers that he is selling on his website you can find them at corbath you can find them at saber bay because now he's selling 89 sabers products and ydd products it's not only at dx sabres never has ever ever been at only a day x sabres ever the x sabres has never commissioned a company to make an exclusive product for them the x sabres has never machined their own products ever i don't know what to tell you he does nothing but repackage and resell at a higher price i don't know why people believe that unless you didn't know which is even worse because he has such a far reach on tick tock and instagram and twitter and when you use people like ray park who is darth maul himself and when you use people like michelle c smith and when you use nascar drivers to show your product to the world and say oh i'm legitimate you got to use people who have a larger platform than you to tell people that you're legitimate that means you're not legitimate hard work speaks for itself if you have to seek out a way to make you seem more legitimate you're not legitimate i seriously doubt anyone at this point is actually listening to this part of the video because video's so long and it's just a rant and people think that this is a personal vendetta i i genuinely do not like paul at all this guy is a bum loser who profits off of the people who are vulnerable if your reason for joining the saber community as a seller as a company is to bring sabres to these people and you know to let's see let's read his his mission statement again we're bringing affordable and super well made lightsabers to the marketplace so that everyone can afford the lightsaber their dreams yet you resell products three times more expensive how is that so everyone can afford the lightsaber their dreams they could buy it three times cheaper somewhere else they could buy it two times cheaper somewhere else they can buy it from the people who actually made it i i don't know what to say this video is not meant to incite people to go attack him because i know paul's gonna think that he's gonna be like oh he made this video and people attack me and threaten me and blah blah and message my family and blah no it's not the point of this video it's sharing public information it is showing you that there are consequences to your actions you cannot escape what you have done and you will not escape there are more than enough people who have been scammed by you who have been lied but lied to by you who have been manipulated by you i mean i i don't know what to say this is this is going beyond a fun hobby this has gone beyond just collecting lightsabers what this has become is you being an egomaniac a psycho i mean no one in their right mind would do this stuff you legitimately need mental help because literally no one in their right mind would ever go this far to do this stuff ever it's absurd genuinely get some help paul and while you're at it shut down your company and never come back small business whatever who cares there are more legitimate ways of making money in providing for your family i've paid my rent i've paid my tuition i've paid for stuff because of this channel i'm not scamming people i'm making my way through a pandemic off of youtube telling people the honest truth about saber companies you're making more money that i'll ever make in a year by scamming people small business so that everyone can afford the lightsaber their dreams yeah right you're a liar you're a manipulator and the consequences will come so people if you're watching this video right now if you're listening to the words that i'm saying i urge you don't go attack this man because that will only feed him that will feed his cause and that does not show an accurate representation of what this community is about this community is about having fun collecting cool lightsabers enjoying star wars it's not about attacking people what i'm doing is not attacking paul what i'm doing is calling him out god-awful behavior and warning people not to do business with him paul's going to say oh he was hired by lgt oh he was hired by corbin oh you're hired by saber trio i've been accused that before i've been accused of being hired by saber companies before to make videos and i have never not one cent not one cent has ever come from a saber community for me to make any sort of content about anyone every single millisecond of every part of content on my channel in the past and in the future has always been on me me not from a saber company not from a font maker not from anyone i do this for the love of the community and to protect people in the community this isn't me getting hired by some other saber community because there's there's a conspiracy there's not this isn't me being hired by a saber company there's this huge conspiracy against dx savers no a conspiracy is something that may or may not be true this is true you're a lying manipulator and you are so caught up in your own lies that you contradict yourself every single day every single time you make an instagram post every single time you post a picture of a lightsaber all right i'm done", "5ur--cA_-pU": "what's up everybody welcome back to an all new episode conflicts today we'll be reviewing these here are the coolest looking lightsabers currently on the market allowing to go ahead and customize them to the full extent i mean not just the body panels you can go ahead and customize even the color the sound and even more by simply calculating them just like this you can go ahead and choose a variety of colors on a spin wheel so it's actually pretty cool now in this episode here we'll be unboxing it trying it out and seeing exactly what it's all about so without further ado let's go ahead and get started [Music] [Music] ah [Music] all right so this is the box that we got now this here is two of the master packs we have the silver and the black so essentially it is the master grand pack so let's go ahead and open this thing up next and see what's on the inside and then we got ourselves to go and just take a look at one for right now so this is the packaging that we get uh so you have this cool looking design concept that says cyber light look at that that is a work of art so we have our saber we have a variety of different accessories so first thoughts are definitely a good durable strong piece of plastic so that's kind of exciting to see how this all plays out now we have our customizing port so we have our handle pieces here so this is actually pretty cool so it's like a red aluminum uh with a lot of different housings in terms of like ports goes you got your simple matte black and then you have this gold casing as well so based on your personal preference of course and then you have our main handlebar so this here kind of is the brains of the operation so this will house our buttons so we can go ahead and toggle [Music] all right so right off the back definitely has a good amount of weight now you do house your buttons right over here you have a charged port and then you have this almost like a subwoofer speaker on the bottom so it does give you a nice terms of feedback in terms of base when you actually swing so should be kind of interesting to see you do have a light right there in the front so when you turn it on i'll go ahead and shine through the saber now we have more accessories as we're kind of going about so you have these different panels over here look at that oh wow so you can see the way they machine this is really really high quality so it's not your standard piece of metal where you can actually kind of see the brushed aluminum or kind of how it looks like in terms of it being polished this is actually a really high grade quality material as we kind of move about we have our bottom panel we have some other pieces for the bottom as well so you can go ahead and customize that and then we have ourselves some screws we have our charger and i believe we have ourselves a tool kit to go ahead and essentially install it as well so i think the next thing we do is going to go ahead and scan this qr code and see exactly what happens i'm going to go ahead and pull up my camera here and pull on this qr code just like this and i'll go ahead and automatically open up the website for instruction or user manual and it says uh looks like it's a playlist for youtube so you can go ahead and watch this kind of tells you how to go ahead and use it and how to go and customize it and essentially it's a tutorial video all right so now that we kind of have an idea of it uh so we have our ways to go ahead and customize it so we have a few different variations so this here's our main housing uh we have our end cap here now the end cap will kind of screw into it just like this it'll protect the speaker again you have a few different variations that you can essentially use based on your personal preference of course and then from there we have ourselves a sleeve which will go ahead and just kind of slide into place just like this and now the way you install it is quite simple you have these screws and now what we'll do is we're going to go ahead and install our top portion we can go this way um you can choose this one right over here so i think let's go ahead and go with this one right over here just because it kind of looks cool so this is me just trying it out without any prior knowledge so i'm gonna hit this pawn button here [Applause] that's so cool all right and then this here's gonna be our black version so you do get the two different variations between the colors so you do get a few different attachments or accessories uh for instance you know you don't have the same exact casings as the other one but this one here actually definitely gives it a unique spin off so based on what your preference is wow it's up to you look at that that is actually pretty cool too so let's go ahead and build one here and see how this one comes out you know you have this amazing looking piece right over here um and i would have to say compared to the silver one kind of up to you on what you like there you go and you'll notice the sounds that's because it has a sensor built into this knowing whenever you move it i'll make a sound based off of that so this is called a smooth swing and the moment you hit something it flashes on clash so literally anytime it hits something i'll go and flash now it also has a blaster mode and then has a lock-up mode so for instance if you hit something obviously you want wanted to constantly make that stuff that effect so you just hit it and hold a button that is pretty wicked now you can go ahead and customize it the way you like it so obviously you can customize the physical appearance but you can also customize the color just go ahead and triple click the top button right here there we go and now it's literally a color wheel all you just rotate it and you can go through all the different colors that is pretty cool huh so once you find a color you like like this just go ahead and select it there we go and now we've selected our new color so you can see that it's actually pretty cool there's no room here but yeah you see what i'm saying now if i turn it off by simply holding the power button it'll turn off just like that and then what i could do is i can go ahead and change the effects i can't do a target effect or like a light effect these are presets or the sounds i guess you could say there you go now we select our new mode this is like a light mode so it's got that like pulsating effect which is really cool too that's so cool and you want to turn it off by simply holding the power button fades off so you hold the bottom button here i'll tell you the battery life 31 so it's 31 battery life uh and then there's a charge part right over here so it's going to connect it to the wall and you can even go ahead and put it five percent life and then go ahead and display it as a wall piece which is always cool too so yeah let's go ahead and put it to the test next and see what this thing can do all right so we're gonna go ahead and try this out um i got my brother over here the con life check out his channel down below fighting against me and we're just gonna try this out you ready all right let's do this [Music] uh [Music] ah [Music] and with that being said thank you again for watching we'll see you guys next time take care now [Music] you", "Iw19ZQ3WVPc": "[Music] so guys before this video starts i just want to mention that i'll drop some new merch and as you can see on the screen right there we've got some t-shirts different designs some hoodies that look really cool and all of that good stuff so the link is in the description down below check it out right now if you guys haven't already what's up guys welcome back to another video today i have a very awesome mod which is behind me and that is the realistic lightsaber mod in minecraft so if you guys enjoyed this video definitely go ahead leave a like subscribe if you're new to the channel and uh make sure you guys turn on those notifications so you don't miss a video so we have this thing right here which is a lightsaber forge so you can actually like forge it together if you were to you know do this legit in survival or in creative you can just get them all but let me just quickly show you guys the survival way basically you need these items here and i think you have to go through some dungeons and stuff to find these items so a little bit tricky in survival but for creative very very easy so let's just quickly get say all of these out right here uh i think that's all of them so if i want a green lightsaber then we go of that one or we can choose yellow blue you know all of that kind of stuff right there so let's put this all in here and check this out bam look at that so that is the green crystal right here so obviously we have like a blue one then we're going to get a blue light for the lightsaber which is awesome but anyways let's just go ahead and make that one and there we go now we're kind of just holding it in our hand there's nothing showing but are you guys ready are you guys right i don't think you are oh wait okay i just had it for a second there we go so um yeah so there we go look how cool that is and everything like swing it around and stuff so very awesome and i mean we can go up to this awesome sheep right here and just hit it so this is probably the most realistic lightsaber i've actually seen in uh minecraft before like i've seen other mods and this is nothing compared to this which is awesome so uh yeah let's just go ahead and uh there is this thing right here so let me just quickly go into creator very quickly and over here so this thing just spawns randomly so you do have to try and find it so if you do end up finding the structure in your world basically all you have to do is come down here and uh we have this weird looking cube right in front of us now you might be wondering what exactly this does well as you can see uh if we kind of zoom out there is different things we can actually do uh for our lightsaber so with this xp if you want to do the cheating way all you have to do is just you know xp and then you can just you know give yourself all of that i need to do this because obviously for the sake of this video i can't legit just go out killing mobs and getting an xp or else the video will go on forever so as you can see once you get xp i have a ton of it now all we have to do is just kind of hold on to this and as you can see there we go we've unlocked a bunch of um kind of powers i guess you can call it so if we come over here so this uh kind of explains what it does and like the name of it so i want to have blade fro because that sounds pretty cool so just hold on to it and there we go we've unlocked it and oh there's another one you know what i'm gonna do that advanced okay so next one um let's go up here what do we have for speed okay uh rebounds stealth okay we definitely want to get some stealth so we can turn invisible which would be very very nice uh what do we have up here dude this is so many that is crazy uh let's go with let's just go with um hmm actually what if we oh okay you know what i think we're good so what you want to do is press f will kind of hold it and you want to drag this here so once you've actually put on the powers so again if you hold f and then just kind of drag them on to here all you have to do is press the hotkey uh which is c it could be different for you if you're actually trying this out for yourself but if i press c as you can see oh my goodness i can throw the lightsaber that is insane okay oh we have to wait for our mana to go back up and boom there we go so if we wanted to go stealth um i think that's actually different hang on so if i go to mod options nope that's wrong options controls so yeah c and activate light okay so we don't really need to do that so yeah this is just let me just see if there's anything else uh no it is not so i don't know how we can actually get stealth i think i need more mana i'm not too sure uh let me press c again yeah okay so it doesn't really do anything but anyways we can throw it at least i did manage to get it to work before but i don't know why it's actually not working what if i do this remove the power can i can i do that uh how do i remove it how do i remove it okay we can just do that i guess so see there we go okay so yeah okay that actually does work so if you hold it as you can see i am now invisible and then i can like kind of like i guess sneak up to someone and bam hit them so let's try the other lightsabers out let's just clear our inventory just like that and we have a lot right here and we have those ones where they're like double which is pretty cool uh so let's try a double one this i think this one is kind of um okay these ones are already activated all right let's try this one yeah let's just try this one so this one we got a little purple light which is pretty cool all right uh and then of course we can go into stealth mode and then we just kind of sneak look so six seconds of being stealth or actually seven but then we like this sheep has no idea the ban so i think i just need to get some more mana but before we do all that uh let's just try the other ones actually hang on we do have some cows we can test on i'm sorry i'm sorry but we have to so a bunch of cows there we go and let's activate this one so just kind of do that nice red one oh the cow's looking at me like please don't i'm sorry but this is for science guys all right here we go yeah oh my goodness yo it hit a few of them oh my goodness this is so cool hey yeah get back here all right let's try this one here um is it gonna be a different color i think it oh i get accidentally through it but uh oh this is a white one okay pretty cool and of course we can throw it uh actually we have to wait for our mana so come on please there we go oh okay oh there we go the cow is running towards me all right this one should be yellow yes we do have a yellow one which is um pretty cool there we go uh we can do this one for some reason it's really weird when activating the lightsaber as you can see like it's turning off and on i think that might be because i'm doing something wrong but uh yeah this one as you can see it's a little bit different compared to the others uh because it has like the little t shape right there which is cool so bam oh oh okay i did i get like a critical hit oh okay yeah hang on so let's try with just a normal one if i jump and hit okay that doesn't oh okay yeah it does ah okay critical hits nice so let's try some other ones that we have inside this chest because there is this one right here yes the double lightsaber so as you can see this thing is crazy and it like spins around this is oh my goodness if you guys like you know star wars and i don't know want to pretend to be a jedi then definitely go ahead and do some of this oh my goodness that cow just like poofed gone alright so where is all the animals did i get rid of all of them all right time to spawn in the zombie pig man all right so now if i do this wait oh my goodness that did not work hang on i was like why did it not work oh so you can't throw this one ah that makes sense all right well now i need to get this one out because it didn't work so actually wait hang on um we do have blade throw yeah and options control is c why is this not working i can't throw it why is it not letting me throw the lightsaber so guys so i finally get found another one oh my goodness actually took too long so uh be aware if you're in survival um it might take a while but anyways uh basically i'm gonna just try to uh do a few of these because i just want to quickly see what some of them do we can't go through all of them or else that's going to take forever so we've got force master so basically oh okay that's actually not too bad um okay we can actually just do this one i guess because we're actually getting the base power which is um exactly what we needed so i kind of wasted my time finding all of this because we just got the base power so anyways uh i definitely want to try this this one is a good one so if we max this out we get force lightning um but obviously a better version of it so there we go perfect and i think that's all of them that i wanted to try oh actually hang on we need to try this one we have to try this one you already know it so oh my goodness the name of it is kind of insane okay well let me go ahead get my lightsaber out so we're gonna pick let's go with a red one so it lets us quickly um oh it's actually night time what that's how long it like took to find this place all right well day time there we go let's uh activate this if i can do that right there we go perfect so i'm actually doing this wrong so with the f that's how you like kind of go towards it so i can technically have you know that in there um what how come that didn't do it there we go i was like what and we'll do this one as well all right perfect so now we're gonna actually test this out on a zombie uh pigman because um why not and let's go ahead and see how awesome this is okay so are you guys ready why is some oh the skeleton just burnt okay well anyways zombie pig man let's do this attack so as you can see my mana down the bottom is now a lot more than before so let's do this all right here we go so look at this i'm literally glowing and then yeah oh my goodness that is actually crazy so we got another one let's just quickly spawn in a few and let's do this attack so as you can see we get the electric oh my goodness that is crazy come here piggies come here buddy there we go oh my goodness that is crazy and i'm still glowing dude i'm literally a um a star wars god all right and then the next one are you guys ready oh my goodness wait what wait what is that little particle it didn't kill it straight away but oh i need to wait for my mana thing okay so that one's not as op as i thought it was going to be but um is that enough now no it's still not enough okay well anyways i like the electric one the electric one is my favorite and then we can like um actually hang on let's hold that i do like this one as well because i do like throwing it uh there we go i could just play with this like all day not gonna lie just like throw my lightsaber everywhere oh my goodness and then let's switch to the electric there we go uh yeah so the miner does take a little bit of time to kind of go up but once it is you are ready to go and uh i think i still need to wait for this one yeah as you can hear it's like not working because i must not have enough mana which is uh unfortunate so let's see um oh okay so i need 170 power use well i already have that so oh okay accidentally used it that was bad so now that i have this there we go oh that was actually effective but i did like throw the lightsaber first so i guess that was kind of cheating in a way but uh electric there we go so we can try this basically with any light saber like you don't need to have this specific one you can have the double one and let's uh activate this there we go and i can spin it around and all that kind of stuff but i can do the same thing um so there we go we can throw it we can do the electric and accidentally killed it and then we can do this um oh i need 170. okay let's just wait for it it's almost there there we go and choke there we go that didn't kill it but then it's like basically like two hits so but yeah anyways guys that is gonna wrap up today's video if you guys want to try this out for yourself i'll leave a link in the description down below but if you guys enjoyed smash the like button subscribe if you're new turn on notifications all that good stuff and i i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] peace [Music]", "KduIzGhnb5c": "The Star Wars universe is filled with amazing ships, weapons and machinery. Whether it's the light side, or the dark side; there's always something new to explore. Of all the technology that you see, perhaps the most fascinating is the Lightsaber. As the story goes, only the Jedi can use a Lightsaber. You can't just go out and buy a Lightsaber. Each Jedi must construct their own; this is why they can vary so much in appearance. Some Lightsabers can be shorter, like Master Yoda's. Some will be curved like Count Dooku's. And there's even some out there that will be double-sided like Darth Maul's. This is Luke Skywalker's Lightsaber; the first Lightsaber we see in the original Star Wars movie. There's a lot of different parts that make this work. A Jedi will usually take several weeks to build their own Lightsaber. One mistake, and the whole thing can explode. Pay close attention here, so the same thing doesn't happen to you. The Lightsaber can be split up into three different sections; Let's go through these one by one. The first section is called the Power Assembly. At the center of it, is the Diatium Power Cell; it's kind of like the battery of the Lightsaber. It's naturally recharging, so the Jedi won't have to worry about it for a long time. Surrounding the Power Cell, is the Power Field Conductor and the Power Vortex Rings. These both work together to move energy up the Lightsaber. Surrounding all of this is the Inert Power Insulator; which contains all of this energy, and ensures that none of it is wasted. This next section is called the Crystal Energy Chamber; A the end of the Power Cell, we have the Primary Crystal Mount. The Energy Gate is what transmits the energy to the crystals; these are called Kyber crystals, and the Lightsaber usually has two of them. They are found on the planet Ilum. This is the Primary crystal, and it converts energy from the Power Cell and transfers it to the Focusing crystal. The Focusing crystal is the one that colors the blade. The last section is called the Emitter Assembly. All of the energy flows from the Focusing Crystal into the Blade Energy Channel. Here the crystal energy gets converted from Crystal energy to Arc Wave energy. On either side of the Blade Energy Channel, you'll find the Cycling Field Energizers; they help the conversion of energy; One side directs the energy towards the blade, and the other side recycles that energy. These two bright lights are called Energy Modulation Circuits. They provide feedback to drive the Cycling Field Energizers. Finally, we have the Blade Arc Tip. This is where all of the Arc Wave Energy becomes a visible blade; Some Lightsabers have what's called the Blade Emitter Shroud; it can protect a Jedi from accidentally touching the blade; hopefully this kind of accident doesn't happen very often. Okay, so Lightsabers they're just fictional right? I can't really build something like this, but it's kind of fun to think about.. Hey guys, my name's Jared Owen and this is what I do. I create 3d animations and I show you how things work. I normally make videos about things from this galaxy... but this video, I branched out a little bit. Let me know what you think in the comments below. If this is your first time here, I would love to have you subscribe and stick around. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.", "IbuCh5bO7A0": "the visible don't you put in the cat whoo there's invisible stormtroopers women I do have a face is it really that time oh yes it is my name is Andy and this is my son why that's right and we do toy videos we do games we do toys I've said that we do lightsabers right here look at it this is a new lightsaber from the last Jedi toys it just came out why is your hand in there your hand is like in this box this toy also comes with Rhydon see he's right here that took it yeah you broke it okay we're gonna do is we're gonna get up in this table we're gonna look at the box we're gonna talk about this and we're going to unbox it and that is right so let's get to it gonna take this have it you don't break it anymore the box that's where we have yeah well we got it shows you the actual toy right here you can touch it okay you touch right his face it's okay I've got so many more notices that I can just put on it's great yeah you don't have extra noses yeah this is of course a Star Wars toy it is a Jedi / v lightsaber so you can be a good guy you could be a bad guy you can be either one but you can't be both yeah cuz they'll be like a double agent and then you're just a bad guy that's very true yeah you can actually touch the thing and do all the lights blue that's pretty cool right alright stop then it's got like a different handle I can shield your hand so you don't get hit by other light sabers yes then it's got like a stiff handle too so that's pretty cool it says two in one clearly because you can be bad guy and good news so that means ages four and up that's pretty young for a lightsaber I mean just swing it around hitting things I figured it would be a higher age but there you go for it up what is the show in the back of the box right it's diagrams yeah it's painless and then what kind is this music Bank yeah so it has a little stiff dude right here and a Jedi and that shows you different ways you can connect it with other lightsabers because as we've done in other videos you can make the craziest lightsabers if you have a handful of them no we donated it we used to oh yeah yeah we did a video on it it wasn't ours but well you do personally have one lightsaber I think maybe two so we'll get into a lightsaber battle then please we got that on the side and ridin don't let it hit your face your face please so fYI don't let this touch your face I don't know why but don't there's the bottom of the box we've got a crazy-looking barcode right you are Ken there's the side of the box here it shows you that you can use the Star Wars app on your phone and create some cool lightsaber movies so if you have an iPhone or an iPad that's pretty cool though the top of the box it says rainbow right here it says rainbow oh you're right sorry it looks like rainbows all right yeah so that covers the box are you ready open this up how much do you want to open this up zero you don't want open this up haha sorry you got chores and buy it on your own ya wanna eat it what I wanna put it on display you like it that much already before every toy you have to get a crazy amount of tape off the box and it's never easy frightened here you want some tape don't eat that don't put in your mouth don't put it on my neck either okay all right cool no I'm kidding knows why I was playing ready you're ready you're ready Wow I do it it's all right it's all right why don't put your head in boxes and pretty sure every mom says that maybe plastic bag that one's got a hole in it so I guess it's fine oh that's fine it hurts it's a box why does it hurt so here are riding scissors when you're using scissors no matter what age you are B that's right yes be careful there we go we got the lightsaber oh it's clear because it has two different colors and it is harder to see in the air all right here's a sip handle and it also is a bird flying what makes flying laser this bird is offended because it looks like a bird tell it you're sorry I thought you may thought oh my gosh we'll put that over there and we got to get this Jedi handle out it's free now what does this thing look like Wow dad how's that happen watch this watch watch watch Oh stormtrooper bring it Hey okay so do you want to set up the Jedi or the fifth one first that's really cool I don't think it's posed to be like that but that's awesome you're kind of like Wolverine or no you're like maracas you don't even know who that is all right so there's a hole at the bottom of this like all the other blade builders and you just turn this in and right have you press this button you want press this button what do it oh look at it and then you hold it like this you're like I am a sit I'm a bad guy oh my gosh I just realized something okay look okay so it doesn't let off that much but when this when the SIP handle is on it it know is to go read every single time that's very cool let's put on the Jedi one and see it turned blue all right watch it's gonna be blue now you can hold your now you can hold it like this though watch watch so you can be holding like this then you can hit the button with your finger pretty cool huh it could have been smoother but that was awesome why are you sawing my arm on do not do this so that is really cool right so do you like the synth one that goes like this or if you like this one I like this one too I don't know if this is supposed to be like a lightsaber piece but if that is that would be really cool I hope somebody has the lightsaber like this in the last Jedi so I guess that's it guys that is this toy we're done in the cat room there's invisible stormtroopers if we've been playing with a toy the whole time are you serious well we got work to do or do I need a lightsaber man can you get me one all right invisible stormtroopers I get that one all right you get the new one we've got some Jedi to do yeah yes that was my line that's what I said make your life turn your I see everyone dude all right are they in there yeah happy very okay go I hope I've been on to invisible oh wait wait wait let's sneak in okay stake it have you ever eaten a cheeseburger you have good that helps me find a stronger person right I'm gonna walk okay and I'm gonna tell you what I see they're in there I can't even see them on three okay one for I think three of them are right there oh my gosh laser blasts dead but there's two more over there go you guess that's done your dad sitting here with a blasted tummy you know I need to give me a first aid kit fine I'm going back to being dead yeah [Music] there we go there is the Jedi sis lightsaber hey what do you think about it right it is really cool the only thing that I have to say is that in light situations you can't see the color that well if you're playing in a dark room well yes it would if you're in a dark room this thing looks so cool but like right now we're in like a sunny room in it you can't see it that well but you still can smash things with it like oh like riding shoulder sorry yes in the basement you turn all the lights off and they would look awesome I like the extra attachment the ghetto in photo that's true I think we both like this one better just because then the spring action was really cool that way yeah and then it guards you if you were to get whacked with a lightsaber wouldn't ever hurt but incredibly I think for anything that's true that's kind of a that's a good idea that's a good point because this is just like metal unless they had like another lightsaber inside it I don't know war Who am I to talk to understand lightsabers it is a little pricey I think this was like $50 oh no wasn't $100 I and I might be wrong but it was a little pricier so personally I would just spend 20 bucks and get a decent lightsaber but it does the same thing but um if you do want a nicer lightsaber this is a good option right and we didn't even mess with the iPhone application that could be really cool so you are getting more than just your on the lightsaber with this but that is this we hope you guys enjoyed this video by the pizza yes if you guys want it will hold hold your horses if you want to see more we do videos here twice a week you just hit the button like he said right below the video son to see more and it's free it's super easy high five oh yeah high five and

well a lot but to us this is everything I see you've already met the gatherers please introduce yourselves and you may call me Tembe now to some of you this may look like a lot of old junk let me show you some of it is neutral let me explain we only call ourselves the gatherers we searched the galaxy for ancient relics abandoned places forgotten outposts and baffled radix planets and what we find we bring it to the workshop so every stormtrooper may see worthless clutter those who know see priceless history and in these troubled times preserving our past may ensure our future you've heard the legend of Luke Skywalker yes yes very good well now we hear there is another a new Jedi do you know her name Rey Rey yes what she is leading it's the spot of hope that we have been searching for for so long and that's why you're here to look ahead well to build this a lightsaber a lightsaber has been wielded by some of our greatest heroes and artisans it is elegant and Emma Grammatik to build a lightsaber is an art the saber is a reflection on its builder with the force flowing between them today you will feel that connection but I'm not oh let's begin shall we begin but perhaps the most important part of the lightsaber the Kyra person able to focus the energy of the force to magnify it some say the Kyber crystal is the heart of the lightsaber at the color of the crystal determines the color but there is wind the blue press but the one wielded by obi-wan Kenobi his apprentice Anakin Skywalker and now ray great why don't you ahsoka tano Master Yoda himself Luke Skywalker the violent person ray beautiful like the one wielded by mace Windu and red become how the crystal of Darth Maul asajj ventress Darth Vader and now I know Ren but these are the stories of the past and we're here for you our future it's now time to select your colors everyone who's raised me whose rights in your mind picture your crystal what color do you see what kind of calls you what color is yours now open your eyes and select your crystal and remember the crystal may be choosing you [Music] orange orange [Music] now if you would please place them in the green personal holders in country we will now pay your crystal with the unique lifesavers eye that you've chosen do begin by building your Hills the foundation of your life-saving control in these boxes of the unique components that the lightsaber design that you yourselves in the boxes you will find the chassis exhibition plates Rick pummel cap and emitter building a light sleeper Jenny just as you've selected your kind of person now select the individual pots that make up your own unique Sigma the gatherer to help [Music] you push your crystal [Music] this is [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] think I like this one cause it has a little [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh here the Christmas here's where they store the ma'am Thank You an excellent excellent bath 11 same as my apron very good choice the wood of the pilot tree strongest metal very nice and a rain cartoon ogre from the cantina has been trying to get her hands on these for a while from us I would never know that you beautiful boy now builders if you have completed your hilt I recommend that you place it in your dominant hand whether that be your left or your right that's your choice start to feel how that lightsaber sits within your grasp start to feel how your fingers gripping how the individual components reflects the weight the balance everything you might say the creation in this workshop is unique if you have a rake one truth that may be a little lighter in weight than perhaps pieces under sit homeworld the bonds between saber and bill that is not only created upon activation it's in these moments when you start to forge those physical connections to your lifesaver yes that's Richfield Howard citizen there you go my old age now if you would please place your life savers in the holders in front of you and take the moment to reflect on your new creation very good you're going completed your hilts and nothing unexpected Oh traumatic happens because why would it which brings itself to the most dangerous parts of the process unless everyone's think setback generous we will now begin stabilizing your crystals for activation this must be done with a great deal of head skill Chinese is a symbol on cracks Kyber crystal and we even have yet another hole we won't be doing that again will we no very good now then as you go forward into the next stage and it's over now joined CR yes sir he begins it is time your journey Master Yoda it is indeed time to take that first step the bonds between saver and builder is about to be forged in a moment on my signal everyone will take step forward place that hands on that knot and together we will activate for the first time you have built a lightsaber like the Chilean city came before you like YouTube they've changed the galaxy remember bill is in your hands you hold remarkable power than remarkable power should not be jumped on the ground the protection you might say but we're pleased to present you with a savior it's now time to make your mark on the galaxy remember you are as unique and extraordinary as the lightsabers you have created and who knows perhaps next time maybe telling your story till the spire [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's welcoming [Music]", "QPxIubq3km4": "Oh No what have you done to me lightsaber hah what this is the most insane lightsaber I've ever seen hey man you want to take a dip hey go piggy oh oh he's really gone alright so hello everyone fudgie here and welcome back to the blade of sorcery via video what was it my lightsaber what is this you know what no screw this lightsaber girl I'm just messing it was actually me that did it River this right here so the outer-rim mod recently got updated so now we can customize our lightsabers even further I think it's blue on the other Kyber crystal tool here they actually changed it back to the default egg so hang on a minute but ah there we go that's more like it now just before we customize more lightsabers over 72% of you are not subscribed so if you're watching this right now and you haven't clicked that subscribe button make sure you do because more content like this is on the way anyway let's go customize some more lightsabers follow me let's go now you may have also noticed that we're actually on Naboo right now and this is a new map to outer rim so I'm excited to explore have a look around and see what's going on it's a pretty large map apparently so there's lots to explore so yeah just before we get in some some enemies maybe kill the Sith we're gonna look through some of the new lightsabers first so yeah you know what let's just pop that there one moment while I go through some of the new content in the outer-rim mod I don't know when it was actually updated but I just figured it out recently so we've got this lightsaber here but what's great about the update as well we can now actually attach lightsabers together they would go just hit it for me look at that that's so cool in my last play of sorcery video I was cow Castor's from Jedi fallen order now it's really annoying because I could have used this in this video but essentially we are we've got cows lightsabers here which are split but of course if we want to we just put them together like that oh that's really cool yes no I'll be honest I don't actually know how you take them apart yeah that's not working I have no idea maybe you can't I don't know I haven't figured that one out yet but that is not all we also have new weapons that include these free rights here and also a new enemy in the game the gamma ray in game Orion however you want to pronounce it up to you or is it I don't know if you know the pronunciation but they are actually in the game now so we'll be fighting them very soon pretty cool looking weapons too okay yeah I'm not sure if this came in the update or not but we also got the light axe head and yeah I don't remember this being in the game like separately I don't know if you can attach this to anything or not but yeah there we go and now I would like to create the ultimate light saber so let's get my my Kyber crystal tool change it to I think it's green and let's see what happens here shall we alright here we go [Music] yes I am the most powerful Jedi look at this lightsaber but this is insane this is actually ridiculous so gnarly can you make it shorter but you could also make it longer as well this is ridiculous I don't know what the limit is by the way I really don't buy as you can see it's going extremely far out right now oh geez how are we supposed to use this hang on a minute right let's just get some enemies let's see what happens don't worry this is I guess not my serious lightsaber but I sort of see what happens to it look at this here we go SIF ambush inbound there's one now anymore not one over there oh man our being surrounded this really is an ambush okay I'm gonna wait for a few more to try and attack me and then we'll use a lightsaber way is that it only free alright well here we go let's see what happens here oh okay I need to yeah there we go Oh No there it is I could I got it we're good we're okay oh yeah never seen a lightsaber this long before what have I even created why is this now a thing all right a good idea what happens if maybe we spin it oh I think it's gonna spin hang on a minute Oh what this is the most insane lightsaber I've ever seen what even is that that's not even classes in a lifesaver anymore Shirley oh I got one nice all right here we go yes I might even try and get it to go longer but maybe we should choose a different lightsaber for that okay keep spinning there we go that is incredible there we go and oh god that guy instead bring it in oh I was entering me alright slow it down slow it down all right now bring it in there we go oh man whoa lightsaber well I mean it doesn't really work that way wait it really is just a little bit too much why does it keep going like that what oh there it is yeah oh now I really have no idea where it's gone that look like it went really high up lightsaber no we lost it we've lost it for good this time it's somewhere I've no idea where you are gonna give me your lightsaber thank you okay quickly I'm gonna just make it freely long again if I can't as a green thank you raise the one that does it I'm gonna hide while I do this real quick just so they can't actually attack me uh where can we go let's see ah and here yes he found my lightsaber you got it man thanks bro that looks ridiculous I'm trying to make a new one now ah come on it's so like awkward to do this I can't believe you actually found my lightsaber oh this might be the funniest Star Wars blade a sorcery video it's so ridiculous yeah you're right you give me that back oh there we go we don't even have to be near them anymore we can just do this and we go alright let's see how long we can actually make this light ski oh man this is funny just imagine if that actually wasn't a limit to how she can have you polite stable it could be the case I don't know yet and I'm not sure if this is even working is it right so I could that should just about do it check it out oh oh man I don't forget how to live it I really don't it does take a little work I'm not gonna lie like it takes a while I can already see the jokes being made about this girl I forget it I think that should do okay let's try this what have I created come here it's like fishing for the syph hang on come here yeah let's get this one what is it this one no no no no that's gonna be ages or is it no no no no I've lost it excuse me have you seen my lightsaber ah it's gotta be around here somewhere oh there it is okay found it yes yeah I've just created the world's longest lightsaber oh yes capable of taking down any safe I don't know why no one for this it's the ultimate weapon look at this whoo yeah this is amazing I love it Oh No what have you done to me lightsaber whoa we can see the whole the mat from up here but I think I'm about to die goodbye lightsaber you will be missed oh that was so weird I just figured out the glitch oh man it's really laggy now hang on a minute so if I point the lightsaber to the floor does it launch me what no it it does not I have no idea how I did that but now I'm completely out of the map whoa whoa what was that again oh yes I found a bug oh that's our bounds goodbye boo there it goes so oh whoa that's weird so I guess I accidentally just found out a glitch where if you create a lightsaber you know extremely long and then jump and extend it and you go flying oh geez what's happening now okay I'm gonna let go that I need to restart all right that was fun but I reckon now we should do a little bit of exploring I think there should be some more books around so once we found one of them I'll spawn in the new enemy which is the gamma ray gomorian I forget the name of the green pigs that's what I'm describing it so yeah will spawn them in in a bit and see what they like to fight ah there's a book there but first let me take a quick dip beautiful ah this is refreshing just go for a swim can I dip my head under all right anyway let's quickly customize the lightsaber that will be good against the enemies let's see what can we go for here no I'll go for this one and they meet spawning another one and then I'm gonna go to the Kyber crystal and just quickly edit it a little bit so yellow to take out the Kyber crystals green make a bigger red smaller blue reset got it yeah blue unstable let's do that let's get two of these shall we pop one in oh wait did it work yes it did nice and then maybe just make it a little bit longer I sure know if I like that let's just keep it to the the normal lightsaber there is gomorian enforcers times up you owe more than you owe more than money to the Hutts and they've sent their goose to collect your head oh no after worry I'll take them all down right here we go bring it on whoa look at this how did I do that okay I distract ah here's one all right let's pretty easy here's another one good Ono began up alright looks like they have more health than I initially thought but that's fine shouldn't be a problem for me hey man do you want to take a dip yeah sure you do hey go piggy oh oh he's really gone [Music] [Music] right well I think that just about does it for these enemies yeah didn't do too bad there huh right now I'm going to quickly go ahead and design a new type of lightsaber so right here we got kylo Ren's lightsaber and I'm gonna quickly just go ahead and get rid of the kind of crystals in this we won't need them anymore wait that's nothing I want yellow that's the one we want there we go all these Kyber crystals here don't dude whoop there they go never to be seen again I just realized I only have two purple Kyber crystals I need free oh dear okay wait one moment I'll be back with one more of these Kyber crystals hang in there I got it I'm back the final Kyber crystal alright let's go ahead and pop these in so I've gone for purple unstable I don't know why I just think he'll look nice I've said it before but I really like the the unstable look with the climb crystal so there we go oh I made it smaller okay let's set it to green as you know it's good blue reset the size there we go and then green okay so you know we could go crazy and have it like the last lightsaber well the first lightsaber I had I mean how ridiculous does this look but it might be pretty useful and bow you know what afternoom is like turn around do a 360 and all my enemies are pretty much dead but then of course on the other hand we could also have this the the smallest lightsaber possible looks ridiculous but it's pretty funny alright let's go especially reset it back here we go let's actually use it now Darth Maul versus my new lightsaber a very very difficult enemy to take down oh no no no no no no okay we're good we're good so it also makes it easy to block attacks as well as you can see so nice very powerful lightsaber right here strange looking but powerful and you can use it like that as well to pin them to the floor isn't that right jack more you jealous of my lightsaber your one looks pathetic now fact I could turn it off there we go let's go nice alright scoop him up and then we're gonna put him in the fountain get in there yeah Oh bad bad dog more I like how he doesn't know how to turn on the light saber oh I got it I did it yes way I've had an idea can we use the tool to make our enemy's lightsabers absolutely tiny I reckon I could do it look at that that's brilliant alright here we go so we got here a SIF boss let's see if I can make his lightsaber smaller while he's actually yawning in this hand this might be a bit tricky is working or not we've got a block this is a SIF boss so we got to be careful here nevermind I'm dead I've got a bear right there anyway Yoda even though already has a small lightsaber we're about to hopefully make it even smaller come here alright just just a still in your hand out out out out out Valeo de baad try to help you out here look not really but oh boy if he's working it's working no way yo stay still while there we go we've got it [Music] yes it actually worked look at that Yoda now really does have the world's smallest lightsaber incredible you know it would be really funny though as if we made it huge maybe I'll do that in a future video let me know if you want to see that that would be pretty hilarious yeah alright well on that note I'm gonna go ahead and end this one right so I really hope you will enjoyed remember to comment like and subscribe and I shall see you in the next one goodbye [Music]", "06ICucCxpvk": "[Music] now friends welcome back to another episode of generation tech my name is Alan at the height of the Galactic Republic the Jedi Temple and course son had created a steady and efficient pipeline for turning kidnapped force-sensitive babies into dedicated peacekeepers for the Republic the most talented ji-yong wings would be chosen and become Padawans to the most successful Jedi Knights in the order along the way each individual Jedi would define their combat style by choosing one of the many forms of lightsaber combat this was actually quite important because it was one of the few things that Jedi actually had control over in their own lives therefore we can learn a lot about a Jedi fighter or a sith fighter based on the form of lightsaber combat they have chosen yeah guys like obi-wan Kenobi who preferred form three which is more defensive and relied on patience and discipline then you had the powerful Vader who liked using form five which used primarily heavy power strikes not only was an individual's lightsaber form in porn so was their masters sir katana was Anakin's Padawan and although she preferred to dual wield sabers with an alternative grip hold she still trained in school five of lightsaber combat just like Anakin did or we can take a look at asajj ventress who preferred using jockeyed dual wielding as well but was taught Mikasa by her own master Darth Tyranus now the Jedi had thousands of years to perfect and teach all of these techniques but what happened so all the lightsaber forms after order 66 wiped out the Jedi Order in the old days of the Jedi Temple an individual known as a battle master led instruction of the arts of lightsaber techniques generally these were individuals who have mastered every form of lightsaber combat and also have a lot of real-world experience finding individuals with a lightsaber the last battle master of the giant temple was syndromic he was slain by Darth Vader during Operation nightfall the fall of the Jedi Temple also marked the end of this very carefully critted Jedi lightsaber training system like during other periods of greater people caused by the religious Jedi and Sith Lords treasure troves of information forever lost which one's a huge blow for the galaxy the Jedi Order was one of the most stable organizations in the Republican had existed continuously for thousands of years thankfully not all was lost though obi-wan Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda along with a handful of other Jedi survived immediate purge together they would stay alive long enough to Train Luke Skywalker the son of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala he was essentially the hope for all future generations of Jedi Luke had missed out on a lot of things including seeing the Jedi Order at its height when it occupied the Great Temple on Coruscant and unfortunately what little training he did get from obi-wan Kenobi and Yoda was usually cut short because of unseen circumstances Luke like all Jedi start out with form on basic maneuvers and trained with the blast shield over his face while trying to black bolts from a training remote run form one or she Chell really is the foundation of all lightsaber combat it helps an individual get used to the weight of lightsaber and perform some basic parries and attacks but unfortunately for Luke obi-wan would cease being an opaque human being shortly after his first training session and so up until perhaps the Battle of Hoth Luke wasn't really proficient enough to use the lightsaber in any form of combat this is why in these early days Luke would oftentimes carry a blaster at his hip as well to supplement his comments style Luke would eventually stumbled upon the Jedi Temple of ediot located on devaron within the temples confines Kenobi spirit became stronger and with his voice he was able to instruct Luke and some training exercises Luke had also found three additional blaster remotes that he could work with building on the exercises he had learned on the Millennium Falcon Luke incorporated all three of the remotes into his routine and was most likely instructed by obi-wan Kenobi in the basics of form three for three server su or way of the my NOC was a terrific defense of shelf form it created maximum defensive coverage with the sword and also maximized the interception of incoming rounds and blasters during this time period formed three probably would have been very useful for Luke there are very few other swordsmen in the galaxy firm that fight against and the majority of his enemies were stormtroopers wielding ranged what and so when actual stormtroopers stormed the temple of Eden Luke was a bit more prepared than usual to take them down but when Luke encounters Darth Vader for the first time on a mission to the Imperial base of Simon one isn't quite ready yet to face a master swordsman Luke's close brush with death made him realize that he needed to invest more time in training up his lightsaber abilities and slowly we see him become more competent with the saber and less reliance on the blaster Luke even has a sparring session with a gladiator trainer and his Magna guard droids Luke was also able to receive more training after the evacuation of Echo Base on Hoth following the voice of Kenobi Luke lands on the planet of Dagobah where he meets Jedi Master Yoda who will continue his training but instead of focusing on the light saber techniques Yoda mainly helps with balance himself emotionally and control the force with more precision like his father Luke picks up Jedi Aang and a pretty old age and he's already developed some worldviews and personality traits that might become an obstacle in his Jedi training and so just like his impulsive father Luke leaves his training well before he's done and journeys to bespin and walks right into Vader's trap during the stool Lucas still out clients completely but now he's able to parry a few blows from the much larger Sith Lord but ultimately Darth Vader's form five is too powerful for the Jedi to overcome now even though Luke loses a hand and is ultimately defeated he doesn't learn a little bit of Darth Vader's form five techniques and incorporates it into his own dueling style after op we continue to see Luke develop as a swordsman he becomes more and more comfortable with the saber and almost never he uses his blaster anymore Luke would return to Dagobah once again to witness the death of Yoda his last link to the Jedi Temple of old now there were other survivors of the Jedi purge who were capable and lightsaber combat so let's take a look at those guys and seeing whether they were able to pass down their lightsaber knowledge as well first we have Cal kes is Padawan and Jarvis appalled the Menace of la Cite Jedi Master who wielded an even larger double blade saber Cal Casaus losses Master probably before he was truly proficient at any lightsaber form he would have known form one by now and some of the other basic moves in other schools even more likely he probably picked up other fighting techniques while he was on the specifically techniques that then use the Force or lightsabers well we don't know what ends up happening the Khal after the events of the fallen order game but Casas does manage to find and destroy a holic on with a list of force-sensitive children that would have been recruited by the Jedi he ultimately decided that it was better for the force that determined their fate instead of him so he doesn't actively seek out potential force users and try to train them then we have caleb dume another padawan who survived order 66 his master Depa billaba had given her life to save him caleb dume was focused on formed through lightsaber combat deepa was a master in that form in length using it in close-quarter fighting situations where she could control the avenues of attack during his earlier fights with the Grand Inquisitor caleb dume relied on foreign 3 heavily to stay in the game but eventually he would incorporate form 5 techniques into his fighting style along with jockeyed dual wielding with all of these new skills caleb dume would defeat the Inquisitor in their last battle caleb would also pass on whatever knowledge he had to ezra bridger who was completely untrained and used the hybrid lightsaber blaster setup caleb also had a holocron which showcases anakin skywalker teaching some basic form 5 techniques this could be where caleb learned these additional moves ezra was also a quick learner but like Hal kisses and Caleb he most likely picked up a lot of new moves from living on the streets as a kid and also developed his own type of moves and learned and copied from his enemies like the Grand Inquisitor now so katana would be another individual who possessed a great amount of knowledge about lightsaber combat and also survived the journey purge although her training technically ended while she was a bad one she was far better trained and experienced in most other individuals and her age as a matter of fact NC State with the temple she would have been promoted to Jedi Knight sir katana using an Orthodox dark I reverse grip combined with the 5th form of lightsaber combat shin she was already one of the most skilled Jedi on the battlefield before she hit adulthood by the time of the Empire circuit was so powerful then she could take on multiple inquisitors at the same time and make short work of them but after Ezra Bridger disappeared into the unknown ahsoka tano tries to follow them and also disappears now on the other side of the formula of emperor Athene the one constant evil in the galaxy he is skilled in all lightsaber forms but specifically formed seven julia also known as a sit form because it feeds on hate and anger Darth Vader also taught the inquisitors and trained them in various forms of lightsaber combat but the two sifts goal was not to have new and prentices but to create servants that could carry out their will and by the sequel era all that is left within the force user community is this Ray and Carlo run both of these individuals were trained by Luke Skywalker who himself had a patchy understanding of all the lightsaber form techniques I'm sure he was able to recover some ancient tax and maybe some holocrons that might be able to teach him some of these other techniques lightsaber comment at this point won't have become quite simplified and crude because of a lack of information and masters now have Luke been able to continue what he was doing and really established this Jedi Temple maybe things would have changed but ultimately Carlo Ren would betray him Laurent was it the other way around kylo mainly relied on form 1 in form 5 gems so he was a powerful force NEWSROOM like his grandfather enjoyed putting his weight behind his blade Rey who only met Luke after his temple was destroyed on even less training she was our of a proficient fighter with the staff making her uniquely suited for a saber staff during her short time on our to Rey does seem to learn some basic form own techniques but her style afterwards is inconsistent but she is a very powerful and athletic fighter who allows the force to run through her during combats if anything our form was quite similar to form 7 Julie over the form of the Sith and one of them was potent techniques available the danger of course with this technique is sometimes the users fell to the dark side by all accounts later taper combat in the future is going to be pretty different and probably primitive and simplified because of a lack of knowledge loss knowledge is one of the greatest tragedies in human history because it reflects the loss of multiple generations of learning and developments an individual human who is alone isn't all that different from an animal but give that human access to the collective knowledge history and technology of humanity they become the masters of this well guys I hope you enjoyed today's episode don't forget to subscribe and hit that notification buttons your home is shown the rest of our awesome content and as usual thanks for joining us today if you're watching this you are generation tech", "dosfwGohCeI": "[Music] [Music] in his turbo toy time you were in the box yeah I had no idea where you were I thought we just weren't doing video today hey but we are in the servo toy time my name is Andy this is my son ridin he has Egon in this hand you'll put you gonna back at Firehouse alright so you guys know what this video is about but this guy doesn't it's actually a surprise for him what is it that exactly I know that's that's why it's a surprise it's just a promise ball alright so close your eyes close your eyes email oh no no I'll tell you win all right look nope it's not for you we get to play with the Danai we're gonna donate it we're gonna put it in the box to go to someone else that it would like it but we're totally gonna play with it today do you have any idea what this is that's exactly what it is well okay I guess it shows it right there is a nerf gun light saber which I thought he would love to play with are you excited for this so what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk about it we're gonna open it up and then we're gonna play with it we might actually have a little battle of our own okay this should be fun you excited no I'll open it boy let's go over the table okay buddy I will not let that go so let's go open it up that is like a new Cup that's not from a guest or anything is it that's new boom okay so here's the presentation the box has an open thing you'd actually touch the lightsaber he does a green lightsaber it looks every time I see a green lightsaber I think of when Luke actually turns into a Jedi Knight and it has the nerf gun attachment and I don't know what this is but we're gonna open it up and find out the back of it kind of displays displays how it should look when you're done it's got the nerf guns got the lightsaber and then it shows that you have just a lightsaber if you want it you don't have to have the nerf gun attached to it and it also promotes the other the lightsaber combinations you can gonna make crazy lightsabers these days he says he has a Kinect well base for that later come over here so the sides are super not interesting like literally there's a bunch of words here who reads this stuff nobody reads this stuff let's open this up pull there we go alright you did thank you for taking that on alright so the instructions fell out which aren't you pretty cool not that I read instructions really unless it's a Lego set it just has diagrams on how to put it together I imagine it won't be that confusing but if we get stumped it's right here for us yeah we got some keys we actually have mom's key this time don't we all right we're gonna start cutting these out turn the lightsaber on alright so I definitely suggest using scissors for this the one time I'm gonna say don't use keys all right here's piece 1 now it didn't break whoo there's the the dirt I don't think anyone when they're making packaging stops to think like is this gonna be easy to open because some of these toys are just awful to open alright comes with two darts they definitely can afford to put more in there but and at least there's not just one right here here's the thing hopefully the ghost won't tie it back Retin have you ever heard me imitated zebra it's because I've never had she's a beauty isn't she the ghost didn't untie it either looks like we're ghosts list today we got that right are you trying to blame the ghost for the darts is that you something just touched my back something touched my back is a keep yo game one where'd you hear that all of it is undone we're gonna start putting this together ridings just trying to do it himself right now all right let's get all this trash out of your first right were you just talking to Darth Vader on your comm unit and then you punched it somebody just put this together guessing how it goes okay I'm guessing it goes like this oh I did it click always a good sign when things click oh these are for ya for connecting here it is ok so I think it's safe to say that I put this together right look into the box look at the diagrams and I did it successfully so it's not that confusing if you can't figure out there are the instructions so it took me a second to realize this but you it like this ok you put the dart in and then you push that down ok ok there and get it and then you want to be the first one to fire you want just fire right at YouTube stand back here now you know right you two you know here it is and all of its glory and just show you all the things that happen this actually comes off press these little things and this can connect other light sabers to it which will mess around with just in a second but for now I'm just gonna explain everything on here here's the button to activate the lightsaber okay the lightsaber collapses there you go that's how you know you just kind of throw it like any other lightsaber and it fully extends how to make the nerve gonna happen inside and then then how do you make a fire yeah oh wow did the ceiling fan it hit the ceiling okay cool right and go get your other lightsaber so we can put it on you like my builders things you can actually make more oh my gosh here you got right you're excited this huh go over there I'll film you wow you're like a Christmas Jedi right now that's the scariest thing a Jedi could do is dance this thing like that shoot the window shoot the window no shoot the window not me wow that was good do you like it yeah what do you want to do with it with me and you alright I figured you'd want to do the nerf with the lightsaber you want to do the whole thing I was gonna take the red one I don't do we have another one oh wow we really do have another one no shooting towards the face okay [Music] you coming out swinging aren't you I'm just kidding you got a huge nerf lightsaber you're running away I got your leg and I'm taking your lightsaber and now I got the big lightsaber I was just gonna say let's be friends man I love you buddy well that was fun wasn't it cuz you stopped me that's cute I do want to be friends go here I love you oh yeah ridin with those PJ's today who just wanted to be it's actually Thanksgiving morning as we're filming yeah so my review on this is that it is awesome it's really well put together and like the nerf gun works perfectly what's your of UI writing do you like it you like this well that was realized ever you just were burnt your hand off yeah exactly and it's a really cool how you can expand with other lightsabers you can make some really crazy contraptions but a nerf lightsaber this is like the best idea ever like props to nerf and Disney and Star Wars for making this happen because it's just somebody's having I mean the chef in the movies Darth Vader would choose I office yeah yeah that means you get even Darth Vader has to be careful with nerf guns doesn't it yeah but that is it that was this video is a lot of fun we truly appreciate it if they want to see more videos what should they do I think that was the one of the first times you've fallen accident in the wild you okay get over here buddy did you do that on purpose yeah are you sure you serious yeah well I know hearsay over here sir but that is it guys we do videos a couple times a week right now we may do more in the future but thank you guys for hanging out and we will see you soon right in what time is it in the video it is kind of like time you go to sleep and I'm gonna do the peace out guys nope I'm holding you down you know I'll do it no I got a peace out bye guys he just went into a box in the corner [Music] [Music]", "r_sYeIpZdC4": "hey guys my name is Ethan and welcome to a new video today I'm doing the lightsaber only challenge so that means I can use building materials heating items but the lightsaber is the only weapon that I can use to kill my enemies with I am very curious how this is gonna go so I need to land on top of one immediately or get it from a chest I'm not sure what the odds are finding one I don't see anything outside wait is mine is there no there's no way this okay please please this is bad this is bad like I'm gonna loot anything else come on come come come dude pretty oh god there's someone there in that corner I appears to be kind of trapped that haven't spotted already know I haven't he did not see me oh that's amazing come on lightsaber lightsaber please I have been stuck down here for so long I haven't found anything yet guess I'm just gonna scout further see if I can actually find one of those things where there should be a chest here on the left side come on can I get one please oh my god fifty players left and I still don't have a weapon yes lightsaber thank you oh my god the six alone pretty and then there's one just lying there amazing who there's two people down here oh they're going in I'm jumping in as well no wait come on come on dice die there we go oh my first kill oh god oh you're low health amazing do my second kill this all started off very very bad I might as well just stay here and try to eliminate people that come to the agency because it's nice and covered but I feel like that's gonna be really boring so I'm just gonna go out and try to find people okay you gotta come to me holy crap oh I didn't see that it was already on top of me I can't build all my working my build wasn't working it wouldn't put a wall there I don't know why I don't feel like this chance is gonna be all that easy okay so unless I find he got a lightsaber from his first Jess that is so sad and of course I don't find okay this works that was really sad okay there's a chest here this one oh my god the first chest yay finally what someone's here oh it's the proper lightsaber as well there's someone in here what a lightsaber I feel like this is gonna be nice no get you yet you I want amazing height so little health but yeah the only thing that's gonna save me is if I can either box people in or out build them because otherwise I don't really see this having any chance of success well I bet he wasn't bought me this sound wasn't working at all that's like oh okay I can go downstairs and then there's like a guided bumps into me with this lightsaber already out and I purposely didn't do that because I wanted to sneak up on him and then deal with him ah this this was such a waste so I died by this exact skin and now it shows up in my face in the lobby I feel like the game is mocking me only slightly though I actually had quite a nice landing and lazy lake but I'm gonna try a different side of this town right now oh my god I have been less I don't see any any way of you surviving this wait how the hell okay there's someone else okay go ahead yeah you know I'm not gonna engage you you're gonna have to face me what the crap really he wasn't even looking my way and then this this is dumb I don't have a weapon this is gonna work huh it actually worked I'm sort of safe okay I can go ahead and find a weapon though these do you lightsaber in here no someone came from the other side I'm dead I am dead oh okay okay he couldn't switch to his weapon and he brought me a lightsaber oh that is so sad then he so said he was like really confused as to which weapon is to choose you can see that the startled nurse in his face oh and it's a proper lightsaber as well thank you so much oh crap I I wholly crap right the to be Twitter can I get both of them okay now wait I didn't get both of them one of them to be everyone out what he brought me healing so that's nice where did he go face hiding hiding up there can probably jump up again that way oh no I shouldn't have survived that I don't know how I won that I'm gonna have to the circle using the helicopter but I don't want to meet anyone so that I don't have to crash this thing into its gonna deal damage and I feel like that's cheating so let's not do that I am however think this thing right here give me that is a 5000 that's a good splurge yes yes that's that's metal spike that'll spice wait how did you eat me oh my god that was glorious he decided to open almost like sure I can dance a bit and then I don't know when you waited too long with building so you ended up getting getting a tiny bit rekt way do you see FK he went afk if I think it was a real person I'm not sure though I am really not sure at this point I don't think lightsabers or BOTS carry lightsabers but still it was very sketchy next later today is gonna make me top 5 that will be awesome I do want to go for him though please open up like as soon as I'm here that will be very nice let's see how are you how exactly are you gonna do this oh I got a hit on them no no no I couldn't turn around how did you get there so fast ah I got too greedy I was like oh I could probably take him and then I ended up giving him one hit and dying cuz he had a drunk gun he was camping there it sucks I got so far those salty Springs oh god it's a special chest I'm not sure if this carries lightsabers it has healing I suppose that's nice it is one more chest here already open two of them come on I hear people I hear people do you save it I am being chased and this person really has some terrible aim is it a bomb or not I am just running away I don't know at this point I'm too afraid to ask as well I don't know how I got out of there alive I will go back to Saudi Springs but I just need to get like a lightsaber from somewhere and then I can actually go fight along with those guys that was the most American chasing me stop dude if there's no lightsaber I'm screwed there's a lightsaber here okay come and get it come and get it oh come and get it this is gonna be my most satisfying there we go Jesus Christ you freakin annoying I feel like this one definitely deserves like a joke come to the dark side okay that's uh that's enough lot again let's go back to salty springs I'm quickly gonna heal up oh my god no no wait I missed everything why are you running no look at them yes yes oh this guy this chase I accidentally built some walls because I

guy out like really really simply and was too late I could thinking about like if I would go to the bottom of the stairs use the lightsaber humor than that what are the odds of there being health a floor perform I don't really have time to fish but if this is like my last chance to find some healing I probably should take it Oh make it make it I'll take it please let's get rid of this before I pop the market there we go there we go that's awesome that's awesome I just wanted to put like a freaking wall there so that I wouldn't get shot by a sniper or whatever well actually a sniper would

that you you kept a lightsaber I officially don't on the lights a props guy gave me one no I didn't it we bought some lightsabers no that was already going on no you have to know what you're doing with it you do though is that which one would you like which one looks like yours the one in the middle is I think the one I use it that's that's Alec Guinness is one oh then it's yours yeah yeah oh my god this is a really nice so amazing how do you turn that one bang them against each other with a break oh no they won't you make the sound effects yourself do you want to do one not at all hey go go go but can you make the noises okay is it true that you did this thing you guys is about to dive yeah like in rocket did this in rocky as well where they had to you would make the sound effect yourselves so they had to go back and like sound was a nightmare because it was a bunch of people going no it was to begin with it was quite difficult not to make the sound yeah and also it goes away because it makes that nice and Shh noise when it goes down oh yes I heard that in rocky they're partly like the first film particularly it's just lords of sound effects of surface you're still all good [Laughter] literally you like litter the light sound let's of lifestyle guess you have to do you have to start them up okay so off off how do you do that much they are there so when you put on it has to make this turn noise mine keeps going off there one a twirl it something do it over here hang on alters here wait wait who's who you just it's there you go actually I should be so can you throw a ball cuz you go you go okay okay we go all right we're gonna let baseball in baseball it how's that okay [Applause] [Music] you", "saZpA0K-FwY": "[Music] i got my eyes what you think hi everyone i'm chelsea smith professional badass today i have an exciting video for you we're doing the top three lightsaber spins and when i say lightsaber spins i mean all the skills that are circular flowy and don't leave your hand they're really great for creating dexterity coordination continuity and they just look badass [Music] i'm so excited to share these skills with you so let's get started skill number one the most important skill you will ever learn in your lightsaber flow even your staff spinning float is basic flow and a 360 turn this is a really great entrance to a lot of combos i use it all the time your basic flow is the foundation of absolutely every manipulation flow skill that you will ever learn regardless of whatever weapon you're using especially a staff so if you can take the time to learn basic flow you're going to open up a lot of opportunity to create flow with multiple weapons not just the lightsaber and that's pretty [Music] badass [Music] thank [Music] all right skill number two of our top three lightsaber spins is obiani also known as hilo whip i love this skill you see me do it a lot it's so versatile you can literally do hi-lo whip with any weapon rope dart staff sword lightsaber you can do it with a knife you can do it with an umbrella you can do it with a spatula it's a really nice skill because it creates a flowery effect it looks much fancier than it actually is i like to use it as an entrance into striking because i can use this low whip to help redirect my weapon into another plane which is really important when you're using heavy weapons and also you can do double obny which i have a tutorial for which just is this really beautiful defensive skill that is worth learning it's really great coordination you're also creating lots of levels you're using the high level you're using the low level and then you can get your body involved or just keep it nice and tight so it's a very beautiful skill and really useful and like i said you can do it with any weapon [Music] [Music] the third skill in our top three lightsaber spins is a windmill again i have a tutorial for this it's just a beautiful flowery really simple skill i like it because you're using high levels you're using the back plane coming up and over so it's really dynamic it has a lot of shifts and it has a lot of texture and once you get it moving it can take you in to a lot of different places so this windmill skill is the perfect addition to any lightsaber vocabulary [Music] so now that we have the top three lightsaber spins the great thing is about these spinning skills is that it doesn't leave your hand which means that you can connect them all together they all exist within the same language and the same flow in the same mechanics so you just have to put one skill after the other following the inertia and the mechanics that you've already created so if you start with your basic flow swing down to reverse you come up and over for your 360 turn here's your high low whip your double lobiani you could do multiples of those and then you can come straight up and over into your windmill and out and just by adding these three skills together you've created a really badass lightsaber flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's it for this video thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you felt like a complete badass if you want more training i got lots of stuff for you there's my free course which is the five essential skills of staff spinning you can find the link for that down below and don't forget that i have tons of tutorials on youtube and instagram so make sure you go follow and subscribe to me on both of those platforms that's it for this video thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time all of those tricks i'm going to just start again so in this video i'm going to tell you my fight keeping in mind that this is a fantasy weapon and we do want to treat it relatively for you today we're gonna do the is the mic turned on okay that's like my worst nightmare i didn't turn the bike on yeah that was my best material oh it was the best work i've ever done in my life no this is this is this is it right now [Music] okay you", "fMApkx6Qs0Y": "[Music] hey guys today i'm going to show you how i went about making this custom lightsaber so this one it's got lights it's got a blade that attaches to it and rechargeable battery and everything so this is just this is a great lightsaber um so i started off with just a image of what this lightsaber is going to look like and i used my 3d programs to model it myself from scratch which i was pretty impressed with i'm generally not a very good 3d modeler but with this one i took that little bit of extra time and effort and came up with a really good 3d model after i had the complete model in the cad program then what i had to do was cut it up into the specific sections that i was going to print it in so that was the pommel the handle is a separate piece the mid section and then also the emitter so i had three major sections to print the handle i made with pipe later on i took these three models printed them out on my resin printer when you have 3d printed parts with resin there's a bit of post-processing that needs to happen so the first thing you need to do is actually getting the prints off the build plate so to do this i just use a scraper i probably wouldn't recommend using a metal one but i'd be really careful so i don't actually scratch the build plate and you just try and get the plates off as gently as the prints off as gently as possible once you have the prints off the build plate it's then time to just quickly give them a wipe over with some paper towel to get off any excess resin then you take it over to your ipa solution or any kind of alcohol solution that you're using and what this does is clean off any excess resin so i put it in the resin bath and or the ipa bath and let it sit there for a while give it a bit of a scrub with the toothbrush but just let it sit there and let the excess resin be removed once you are happy that all the excess resin has been removed you can then go and clean off all the ipa or the alcohol that's on the print so to do that you just clean it with hot soapy water i have all my parts ready to go you can see i've got of the middle section here i've got two copies of them because this is the first one that i printed and i wasn't happy with how it turned out you can see all the supports here i put them too close to the actual model so i didn't really check it properly when i did it so some of the supports even here they're actually the supports are running through the model so when you try and get them off they don't actually come off very easy so it meant when i went to cut them off like this they were still attached to the actual model which means you get all those little marks so i wasn't happy with that at all which means i redid the supports printed it and now just got a flawless flawless one i've got all my other pieces ready to go so i think the next step is to start putting them together with the pvc pipe i've chosen this one specifically because it has this thicker part at the end so that's actually the perfect diameter to fit the lightsaber blades so in my 3d model i also built out a wider diameter in the end there so this can slot over go all the way up to the end and it stops at the end so i'll just cut this off there and that's not going anywhere and then the other pieces will just slot over the top just like that so what i need to do is now cut this to size the way i'm going to do this is the light saber is actually going to separate at the handle in the midpoint so that when the light is in there you can actually charge it which means i want to bounce that much at the end that should be enough for these just a little bit more because it's always easier to remove more than to go back and try and add some in so let's go and cut that off there [Music] next thing i need to measure out is where to drill the hole for the button to go through so to do that i'm just going to slightly assemble it [Applause] and now i can see exactly where the hole needs to go all right so now i'm going to go ahead and draw that out [Music] [Applause] so now i've just got to test quickly but all my parts fit together properly and then i can probably start gluing some together so what i'm doing is i know that that line is center and lining it up there so i'm going to do is just notch a line and there so when i glue it on i've got to match those two lines up to glue this together i'm just going to use classic superglue it does the job it works really good with pvc and it works really good with this sla resin which these prints are and no need to be shy with it use as much as you want so line it up and then straight on [Music] and that'll set up that's set up so that quick i can't move it now even if i want to so the lines are lined up so i know that that is center is the actual mid section this bit's going to be a bit harder to get center i'm gonna have to do this motion really quickly and then line it up [Music] all right let's do this this bit is always the scariest because if i screw this up now i'm in a bit of trouble and we'll probably [Applause] i don't know what i'm going to do if i screw this up i'll probably have to start from scratch because or try and drill out the pvc so hopefully i don't have to do that all right ready done and that will set up right there perfect the hole has lined up perfectly all right that's the hardest part of the whole build i reckon because it is can go so wrong from there but it didn't we're all good i want to work on the handle how i'm going to do the handle so that it can remove itself from there is i've got these couplers and they fit perfectly over that size and that doesn't come off so that's what i'm going to use for the handle to join these together to make a little bit longer of a handle i've just got some off cuts so those will glue together like that and then this will glue my pommel on again be quick because super glue sets up very very quickly when it's put together in something like this all right ready [Music] that's together done so there's a little bit of a ridge there so what i'm going to do is take this outside to the belt sander and just smooth that off so it's one smooth handle i'm not going to attach this yet i'm going to attach that right at the end because this section will be wrapped in leather and this section will just glue on the end after i've completed painting it done nice and smooth that is completely flush you can take a little bit of a gap but that's just because there's a little bit of a gap between the glue but that is super smooth that'll go perfectly on there so the next stage is wrapping this in the leather so i'm working i'm working off that image that you saw earlier from the lightsaber builder yeah the light the handle grips are about i'm gonna say two centimeters apart there's a little bit of an overlap over it but i think it's about two centimeters apart this doesn't have to be exact maybe two and a half centimeters i don't know how much i need either so i'm just cutting off what i assume is excess and then i can always cut off any extra so this top line isn't super straight so what i'm going to do is just line it up on my mat behind and then i'm going to cut it so now i can do my long cut it's gonna be a long process of just glue wrap glue wrap there we have the handle done ready to go that'll slot in just like that so now it is time to paint the pommel and the mid section in the emitter to do that i'm going to do is block off this inside because i don't want paint getting in there and then just start with a one layer of primer i'm gonna prime it first always gonna prime first so let's get to that next thing to do is start to get the light section ready so this just simply pulls apart there's my lens which i'm gonna use later take out the button i need to now cut this in a certain few places one of them being right here now push this section out [Music] this section out and that's what i need so it's quite a bright led will create a nice nice lightsaber and this will slide up into the lightsaber you can charge it out through the bottom easy so the way i do it is i put the two lenses a spacer as well as the lens and those three combined in the right distances apart create a really nice beam so that goes right up the lightsaber and doesn't waste any life all right let's get to putting this all together so i've got my parts primed and painted in black usually i would block off the black or tape off the black and then paint over the silver on top but the way that this model is i think it's going to be easier if i paint it all in silver now mask off the silver then go back over it with black so i'm going to go do that now paint it all with silver yeah we'll go from there so i've put down my layer of silver i've taped off where i'm gonna be painting black so most of the emitter up here on the inside will be black black rings there a little bit of black there and then also on the palm here so let's go and paint these black all right so it's time to start unmasking these this is the funnest bit so let's get started [Music] time to start working on the d-clip ring that will go on the bottom so this is the little attachment that i modeled and printed so that will go on top then the d-ring will slide in there and then that side to hold it in place i'm going to add an extra little screw there so i'm going to line it up and then just drill again i'm just going to use super glue for this it works the best and then i'm also going to put some super glue on the screw as i screw it in and that just means it'll never come off just like that make sure the hole goes all the way through you can see that it does so now i can screw this in that is never going to come off perfect so really happy with that now let's actually make the d-ring clip that goes around it all right to do this part i've got my pretty thick wire here fits in the holes perfectly so i just take my two pliers and start bending [Music] there are a few sections on it that i'm going to be painting this gold color which kind of to be honest looks more bronzy than gold but that's exactly the color i'm after so one of them is in these lines here so i've already done one of them just to test it so i'm happy that it works so you can go go ahead and do the other one i've got a really small paintbrush here get some ink out of the permanent marker and just take my time and stay within the lines so free handing straight lines like this very very hard to do but i think i did a pretty good job so a little bit of black there which i want to keep because it adds and adds an element of depth to it even though there is no depth so i'm going to keep going pretty much um done so what i need to do is glue the pommel on there the this is meant to come apart here because that's where when the lights up in there you'll be able to recharge it at the port at the bottom there so i don't want to glue that but it's time to glue this section here so just get all the super glue next stage is to start weathering this so the painting's all done that turned out great like the extra details with the gold there but now it's time to go over it with weathering so to do that we're going to use um primarily brown and silver so brown for the for the dirt and grime that builds up and then silver for the scratches and the highlights over everything so let's get to it so a few things that i need here a paintbrush so this paint brush i'm going to use for the highlights and it's a good dry brush nice separated thistles and then i've just got a regular paint brush here that i'm going to use for the grime so for the grime i'm using burnt umber it's a great color it dries nicely to give a nice finish so with this it's just imagine wherever there's dirt um don't build up grime so it's all in the crevices and things like that so with this i'm just going to go in put it in and then go back with a paper towel and just rub off any excess [Music] so it's time to now do all the highlights and all the scratches so i'm using a silver sharpie this works a lot better than silver paint as it's a lot stronger of a color it dries instantly and it allows you to get really small details whereas with paint it's not going to be a small detail so what you do is just get a little bit on your paintbrush brush majority of it off and then go in go in and just add scratch marks so this would be pretty much anywhere that the lightsaber can rest or just anywhere where there'll be some natural natural scratches on it and with that painting done i'm pretty sure it's time to start assembling this so pull it apart this slides up so we want this to be really friction fit because we're going to be using this to charge it but we obviously don't want this slipping and sliding around so i need something to push it down with let's use [Music] pliers so we want to be quite gentle here we don't want to push it too far you can see the switch is nearly lining up [Music] one more done so one tiny bit more and that is in there so this is still attachable just like that so you can charge charge the lightsaber for now we just need to put the button in so i've got my little spacer because it's quite deep in there so i just need a little spacer and then now the button which i've hollowed out the inside so the button sits in there nicely now if i press this button we have a light perfect look at that [Music] and it's good it's got really nice bright light so we can test this out with a lightsaber blade i've got these standard 25 millimeter diameter lightsaber blades and this should just friction fit into the end i might have to do a little bit of sanding on the inside because there's a little bit of paint that got in there so it's made a bit tighter but i'll do that in a second but there we go look at that it's really nice and bright very happy with how that's turned out so you know i'm just going to sand in that in that um emitter section and this should be good to go so the last thing i did was used a bit of the fabric from this biggest sheet i had here burnt the edges a little bit and burnt the insides to make it a little bit weathered and then just wrapped it around because i thought that would be a nice little addition to make it a bit more used and more yeah more personal so there we go guys that is it completely finished i'm yeah beyond happy with how this is actually turned out just it looks great so we can attach the blade into it and it friction fits in there quite well and there we go [Music] in order to charge this what we do is we pull this apart here we have a usb slot in the end there so all you need is just a usb extender you plug that in and plug that in into just a normal usb charger one additional thing that i also made was this just this belt clip so we pulled the blade out so if you want to store this on your belt or anything like that you just clip it in this bit loops over your belt just like that perfect all right there we have it guys my custom 3d printed lightsaber that i had just an original image for modelled it myself printed it out and finished it to be just an amazing lightsaber couldn't be happy with how this has turned out so hope you guys enjoyed i'll see you on the next one like subscribe and yeah see you later [Music] you", "U3evLd6tvO8": "every time I boot this game up there's always like a new surprise that I haven't what the hell is a Powderhorn there's always a new surprise that I haven't seen and today is no different feast your eyes upon this this is the light axe just when you thought blatant sorcery with the Star Wars mod cannot get any more weirder or better or more cooler they add the light acts like this this thing is it's an axe that has the lightsaber thing it's it's like which what what more do you want this is so free and I can

bury it a thought I'll chop your head off the only thing that I see is a little bit of a problem here is the fact that it's super loud but it seems to like do go over here as well so as soon as I grab somebody they just get attached to like the front I don't like that I need more people to fight against so give it your best shot haha you thought you could defeat me with that puny sword of yours I have a light axe but slice slice yes not only do I have one light axe or we have the lag again oh boy we're just gonna face the other way girl so we don't have the won't you have some RGB going on there does that make you a better gamers not that you're a gamer you're some sort of a Jedi thing but like you know okay stick it okay it is really loud this it is super loud it's also super laggy why

gonna chop is actually its leg no we so quickly funny trapeze like a hey yo chopper get off oh this light axe is amazing I love it can we use it as is deal why does she have a purple thing on her face I've broken the game I've seriously broken the game needs a way to give oh why am i showing everybody off with the finger I don't know why that is I might have to restart this what happens if we go to like another area so let's go to the arena maybe the arena is more friendly with the frames and stuff so maybe doesn't lag as much you know I don't like the fact that it's lagging that much the light axe is freaking cool man it's seriously amazing if you guys haven't downloaded this mod already you should it it's called the outer-rim mod and you can find it on Nexus mods time to time to try this out one more time see if you see if we can actually I think you can use this to climb as well so if I were to how the hell do I even jumped Oh I press the thing that's how we jump all might hold up have I always been able to jump this high what is this what is my jump even that's just not even healthy I have the high ground I am invincible I don't know how that line goes oh my god we're running on top of the arena I'm seeing things that I've never seen before that's new from this game because I've played this a lot you guys also told me in the previous video that if I used like right now you know we're just gonna dick around for a bit if I use this thing and I start to [ __ ] and I start spinning with it I can use it as a helicopter but I don't know what that means I should be supposedly like able to fly with this don't know don't know how you guys hurt okay is can I can I grab hold onto trees on hold Street please can I get it guys how do you fly with this tell me how I can fly with this I want to be able to fly with it don't work like that though I can't I can't make its pain in my hand so I can't make it fly we don't want to fly do we have like a variation of the X or do we only have one you only have one X oh that's a shame I thought we could have like oh maybe can I paint my ax let's poke yes I can okay that is amazing all right purple unstable yes okey I am ready to I'm just I'm just so ready I was born ready man let's do this I don't even want to fight against VN eyes right now I wanna fight against plans stormtrooper assault yeah was just to have stormtroopers fight me whatever I'm gonna be I thought I have the ax activated I'm gonna deflect some bullets shoot at me I dare you I dare you hey why is the head here again what have I done with the game there's a purple man I see you two have broken the game come out completely why do I have so many enemies here you cannot even get close to me this is so noisy this is so very noisy I can't even hear myself thinking right now get get deflected by my bullets they go one head is gone can we get my axe back please yeah this is what I meant it's stuck to the end of the axe even though there's nothing there there you go let's just reactivate this there's a lot of stormtroopers here they have never seen the likes of me before and this is lagging a lot oh we all might do your reward it's lagging I can't even there you go there you go there you go nice ah you can see me again I had an idea okay so I wanna I want to try and see okay I want to see if it's the mod that is breaking this for me or if it's like actual blatant sorcery cuz the lag is unbearable okay you cannot enjoy a game if it lags that much you're you're I'm saying so the camera will be a little bit shaky now cuz it's not out of smoothing it's not wide it's not anything I have that turn off so let's go back to Kenya and hopefully it works a lot better cuz I don't I want you guys to enjoy this more as well not just me let's see now oh yeah okay right that works just as well as it should let's spawn a couple of enemies and let's start decapitating them and see oh the game holds up Jedi ambush yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah brilliant brilliant why am i able to jump so freakin high is that a part of the mod oh no no I don't want to fall down just yet there you go alright I know you guys don't see as much right now but hopefully you still enjoy what I'm about to show you oh sorry Eddy stuck over there again did I break the game one and her head is stuck as well and her head is also stuck oh okay and I just want to point out that it is lagging as much as before it might be a little bit better though feel my power scope what up there you go I lifted them all up good bye see you later this axe is amazing but the fact that it's breaking the game it's kind of breaking it for me as well and his head just went super flying see you later suckers I don't want to be here with a lag field filled play so I'm just gonna go down kind of jump from this place no I don't know how many powers to jump from like a non jumping position or whatever okay let's go down here quicker Oh oink this axe is amazing to like climb with alright oh I found a head I can play golf with it and there's a head over there as well this mod is breaking the game look every head is getting stuck in that is not the way this works no okay we're just the kippur there have my axe I don't give a [ __ ] we're back in this mode I had to restart the game a third time he just likes a lot with the axe okay the ex is super cool it is super amazing I like it it looks pretty swanky but it breaks the game pretty pretty hard okay just it makes it completely unplayable you can just tell me what these things do because I cannot seem to be oh hold up they actually do zoom look at that we can zoom oh yeah so they are binoculars that just they just they're just porn oculars I don't don't even throw sins everything else seems to be failing seems to be glitching out spawning heads where heads should not be spawned I'm resorting back to good old methods and that is my screwdrivers these things will not do any more harm than they should but they should do enough harm to decapitate them or you know ah there you go yeah screwdrivers all I need toss it up in your forehead I missed him there you go back in your head yeah you see I don't need no lightsaber axe to take care of plebs like this I can do with a regular good old screwdriver I can even toss this away and he'll die almost I do have my power still so we can do we can do this oh there you go just like that okay get my screwdriver back can I touch these as a dagger lawyers who do the short question is yes I can throw the messy dagger my girl you have a tiny lightsaber I have a tiny screwdriver let's see who can if I wasn't an immortal that would hurt if you want some of my screwdrivers I completely made your lightsaber useless did I not hey girl what's a bear it's Birds look at the birds the birds alright she's gonna pick up a lightsaber but you know what I want to do I think you guys know what I want to do I want to grab her arm and disable the lightsaber oh [ __ ] no okay she she did alright don't die don't die from my touch man don't die I can disable your lightsaber how you like them apples what are you gonna do now your lightsaber ain't no working no more right let's see if we can let's see if we can do the same to her I need her to attack me what and then I need to grab her neck or arm either he's fine there you go stop stop attacking me stop attacking me and then just do this there you go ah what are you guys gonna do now I've disabled your lightsabers you need something like I have this thing the screwdriver it's pretty cool it's the most powerful with music yeah don't work Oh John waking this up here with a screwdriver instead of a pen you might have lightsabers but they're disabled I think that is a perfect way to leave this if you guys want to see more blade and sorcery in the future leave a like on this video leave a comment down below tell me if you want to see more of gameplay or whatever you want to see you know just just leave your thoughts I'd really just wanna interact with you guys so follow me on Twitch cuz I do stream there occasionally and we could hang out you know I hit his arm", "RrycAn2oNmM": "you're no match for me Jedi I'd look pretty good with a blue moustache we're done this isn't even a real lightsaber this is like one you get like at a carnival all right put that aside but it is told by God it is turbo toy time my name is Andy and this is my son it was apparently into singing today and up heading his head but it is also a lightsaber time and we have this we have a real lightsaber I saw there's a target for nine dollars on clearance used to be 30 bucks I thought it was too good of a deal to pass up and of course we're gonna donate this after we're done playing with it but we're totally going to look at it talk about it unbox it and so let's waste no time ratted oh don't try to open it just yet let's go over to the table and get this started okay give me a light fine that's a high five at lightsaber I felt it on my face did you wear my shirt today yeah yeah we did hey what would you do if I named you an acorn boy instead of ridin ya right and what are we looking at here right now yeah it is a lightsaber not used to red blue green even purple lightsabers but what color is this it's a Lelo or yellow yeah yellow there you go some people might not like a yellow lightsaber I think it's kind of cool personally I like it that's probably why this is only nine bucks but there's a little little bit of purple here but what happens is you can connect it and make different formations if you look in the front of the box there's a guy named Ricki I thought his name was a corn boy okay this right here is the real a corn boy this is Squatch real okay I'm gonna take your name echoing boy all right that's with me okay what do you want to do what would your favorite lights are on a corn bull a corn boy right here is in jail but it shows you all of the stuff you're getting in the box it shows you different variations of how you can assemble it which we will and then it has the little Star Wars logos over here a cheap price tag and even on the front has words we don't care about right yeah so it shows the light saber shows you the small laser pieces shows you're riding over here and then it shows you my dad's face my eyeballs come in the box yeah pilots really go you don't think they come in the box all right fine if we find my eyeballs in this box then you don't get allowance this week you don't even get allowance anyway so so yeah it's just a breakdown of really you know if you get other sets which are right down there you can mix and match and have a multi-coloured light saber look at that doesn't that just look like a box of skittles black yeah that's what a box of dads who look like just watch the light sabers yeah my gosh quickly on the side there's a Star Wars logo there's a Star Wars logo in a cartoon there is the barcode dude absolutely DeMarco watch the dad code it sounds like so it sounds like you're onto something there I like that what was it do you just bust a move right here oh we got an acorn boy and thus another Star Wars logo on the same let's open this up though we're gonna put it together and this is pretty cool though $10 that's like you probably like the cheapest Star Wars project you could have bought at Target whatever they used one toy boxes the tape is just unbeatable oh all right we get to take all these out some of it'll be easy oh there we go wait that's right it is like a baby lightsaber like when you were 2 years old Wow oh my gosh don't ki don't get me with a baby lightsaber I can't do a fool yell because it's a tiny lightsaber mm and then you run away he gets me for the baby lightsaber than the one I tried to get him he just books it and together they make lightsaber chopsticks be very very hard to use they also double as jingle sticks which work but watch out because my jab too hard so it's not too safe don't tickle stick me now let's get this out of here though no fast here's the big one hold then we have all of the pieces has a bunch of hair feeling this box needs a haircut all right so the basics of this is that we have the big pieces and then these smaller pieces and you put them in and they click in here and then you combine it to make more pieces okay so what we're going to do we're gonna use some of the designs on the box and we're gonna make some lightsabers okay I'm gonna make the top level this great piece take that off and then put it on okay confusing take it off and put it on look at this lightsaber look at here it is this is pretty cool right and you're gonna get up and I'll be sure to actually use that that'd be so hard to swing it and not get hit by your own lightsaber writing that's just a dance move you just look at your dancing and even did you see obi-wan Kenobi ever do all right Zoe clearly rided loves this one we're gonna keep making a few of these though there's some very weird ones okay well make that one that one's super weird oh this goes in here there we go that's that one I don't know I guess you're supposed to put it like this so the lightsaber would get you this just blocking it and then you could be like blah hair good to ride just like that [Music] what buddy there's no way anybody would hold it that way don't chop chef Geoffrey it's a lightsaber not a blaster the thing is so big Wow so here's this and there's one more that looks kind of cool that I'm gonna do you got to pick that one all right so like that one I like this one it's kind of like Darth Maul's lightsaber only a very baby other side yeah all right so that gives you an idea you can use your imagination and make so many different variations but I think this is really cool like for nine bucks there are different sets with like different colors and those are probably the ones selling better but this is awesome like you should if you guys like this you should go out and get it while it's on clearance right now it I mean at least here in Cincinnati was on clearance so maybe your targets differently I don't know and also to demonstrate how well it works with other lightsabers we have one Orion's right here bah-bah mega lightsaber pretty cool it's so big oh right it come here no I think you're in the cat room I don't know why we they're always in the cat room can you be in my on my side will be the good guys and take the bad guys down ok let's do it I need a lightsaber though could you get me one I've got a lightsaber look at it what do you think about it chef Geoffrey oh you're running away he's scared of this it must be a good lightsaber this is a spy mission ok we got to be very very sneaky and quiet and that is a shoes lightsaber let's go god I want you to peek around the corner quietly and then tell me who you see in there ok now come back come back come back before he sees you who's in there who else don't don't freak out come on get a virus are you ready you're gonna go for Darth Vader ok I'm gonna go for mr. Potato Head again alright let's do our best hit the rock rock 1 2 3 Renault Mac for me to feel you're no match for me Jedi [Music] no I have a gutter you can have the car and all of the magnets on the fridge [Music] good job so here it is this is really awesome I don't think I have got a toy that's cheap like this and been more impressed with it it's I think it's just the colors or why it didn't sell as much as it's on clearance but I'm okay with that because we got an awesome toy right here didn't we yeah we of course it's not going to keep it we're gonna donate it but I'm gonna give two thumbs up on this one okay ridin gives you 10 thumbs up even though nobody only has two but uh that means he likes it too so there you go really cool lightsaber I really love all the lightsaber toys

like this I get I guess I get to do the piece out now you know I do it you smashed my cheek [Music] [Music] [Music]", "irvU09MM-l4": "[Music] ratings I'm shad and I've recently made a video talking about how someone would actually fight with a light saber if these were real weapons looking at the actual characteristics and qualities and stuff like that and in it I do kind of start to talk a little bit about how the Jedi have been fighting with them that is more inspired by real swords than actually looking at what the qualities of this weapon is and I talked a bit about raised fighting being the worst in this video I'm fulfilling that promise where I'm going to explain why so bad is horrible okay but if you want to find out how someone should fight with a lightsaber instead of specifically how bad Rey is it doing it check out my video I'll put a card there link in the description and I posted it a couple of days before this one so why is Ray's fighting so bad specifically and it's that I don't know I tried to make hers different you know how special or something like that where is yeah you know in previous like Genesis a-flat they are either doing the full-blown Hollywood thing when it's just flashy fighting you know big wide swings and generally not caring about telegraphing or over swinging and leaving yourself open stuff like that or they actually try and incorporate some historical stances as I mentioned in my previous video but Ray okay so we start with the training montage not looking at the force awakens okay I'm looking specifically out of the training montage in the last Jedi and so Ray is there and she takes this stance this is the stance okay and she's holding it and she goes oh yes and one side of the rock and she goes like this [Music] now why is this a horrible horrible sword fighting sense if you guys know anything about martial arts or swordsmanship you'll know what I'm about to say okay this is horrible because there is no forward and back balance in this stance like this okay get a solid knock you didn't go flying back why do you think in martial arts the stance as always foot forward and the foot isn't directly back behind that one it's off okay so this means you get forward and back stability and also side to side stability this is the most fundamental states in so many martial arts but this thing okay no it is wrong on so many levels okay and she keeps it through most of the training montage so after she does the whole uh-huh her thing oh yeah and then she does this twirly thing grab me oh I and she grabs it in an underarm grip like this [Music] have you ever seen anyone you know has studied should have seen a [ __ ] I guess you'll find that it's extremely rare if not just non-existent at all you know it's time you use a grip like this if you using a dagger ryan stabby stabby but an actual sword fighting no you get far less articulated movement with it like this I mean it looks cool and you can do you know oh look look I'm spitting this sword well you know yeah you can spin it that way as well I'm gonna I'm gonna changes yeah something a bit more substantial this will be this is a better lightsaber you know analog I should have used my other video but look at me I'm an idiot oh yes you could you could do that really and then you see kind of an up with the cameras down facing up and you see her doing this this isn't an over-exaggeration this is what she is doing [Music] I don't know who choreographed this mess but it is an absolute dog's breakfast piece of chunk okay like not only is the stance horribly wrong okay she's doing these wide baseball bat swings and anything like this okay like my soul dies a little bit watching it and thinking about that montage you do not want to over swing when fighting with a sword even with a lightsaber where's not you no no edges off other video stuff okay but over swing is bad because if you miss your mark you're wide open okay which is why a lot not every but a lot of sword strikes end with the sword remaining on point okay well it's there or it's ready to go into another guard position this is doubly effective with a long sword because of the cross guard and I love this so if you land a strike and you end like this there's actually still an effective guard position because a cross guard is there to prevent any downward strikes hitting you and if they go for the legs you just move them back and you're safe because they can't reach and so keeping the sword on point very important and the circumstances where you would do a strike and you overextend you don't do it all the way we do it enough and you're needing it how keep in mind the follow-up strikes that you'll want to do a sword unless you that's the killing strike if you do this big slash and the opponent is dead now I'm not so excluding you know the senses we actually hold the sword back and stuff like that I'm talking about you know not telegraphing in over swinging your strikes sometimes you do want to Telegraph as a feint some of my favorite Telegraph's is going in for a forward thrust and get them to you know try and engage the sword to knock it out of the way you're just spinning it around for a strike on the other side another Telegraph I love is coming in for a side strike like this to get the opponent to block on this side but instead of going all the way I Telegraph a lead-in and then spin around for a strike on the other side they work pretty good but telegraphing a strike at you're committed to mmm it's not good okay the opponent will block it and honestly they might just you know avoid the attack completely and then follow through and hit you in return and so raid who in this hole so bad and yet from what it appears to be two main you know practice sessions with a lifesaver and that's if we are including in a fight with kylo Ren in the force awakens like her fighting the Imperial Guard and stuff like that that and the thing about the Imperial Guard here's a bit of commentary on when she's fighting with kylo Ren against you know those red guys okay it's bad I mean it's hot Hollywood action you know flipping around lots of movement looks nice and stuff but you slow it down and watch a couple of key at things like the first engagement okay there's this red guy he hits he gets knocked back and then he's kind of just spinning around and stuff like that and he goes in for an attack but Ray is actually going to get hit so he hacks to pull the attack and purposefully miss and so Ray should be dead there and the most egregious thing about and you know it's funny she's not fighting the whole this way like you know in that fight scene as they just go back to the Hollywood standard flashy stuff but they really mess up the choreography in there cuz there's one thing here's this guy okay he's got this we'd start eating and he splits it into two daggers and it's fighting ray with two daggers and there's this part where he get grabs what ray like this and the knife in this hand disappears they legitimately edit it out have a look slow motion you see this is a dagger and you know ray should be dead she can't defend her back the guy has a dagger right they could have stabbed her in the back and they see this and they're like whoops we'll just make that dagger disappears I don't do force power ray you can make weapons disappear I don't know but she should be dead ray is legitimately the worst a laborer lightsaber fighting Jedi in all a Star Wars Canon it is an absolute train wreck from the montage to the fighting and I leave vent that so there you go and if you want to know how they Jedi's food fight with a lightsaber go check out my video that I've previously posted you'll enjoy it so thanks for watching and of course I have to see you next time till then [Music] [Music]", "SC3jGEp5llU": "Hey guys this is Make it Real, the show on Youtube that takes fictional ideas from movies and video games And makes real working prototypes We've made Batman's grappling hook gun Captain America's shields Thor's hammers Han's blaster A James Bond spycar And even Zarya's particle cannon In fact we have over 70 videos in the series and you can check them out by clicking on the link in the description below But one of our most popular projects this year was our attempt at building a real life lightsaber It worked but could have used some improvements Now we realized that his blade design isn't quite as durable as we had hoped So we've already come up with a much better design that's going to be hotter, stronger and much easier to cut through things but something like that is going to take quite a bit of time and money to produce so make sure you subscribe to the channel and enjoy our other content while we develop the world's first real lightsaber That's right we've been working on this new design for almost a year and invested thousands of dollars into it It's actually fully reproducible but I don't think we're willing to sell it just yet So I'm pretty excited to show you guys And channel members do get access to our CAD files if you dare to try making it yourself Now just to recap this is actually our 3rd attempt at building a real life protosaber If you remember the first time the power supply exploded and the fire department got called on us now the second lightsaber design did work but it ad some issues the heating wire wasn't very robust and sometimes would actually fail quite violently plus when it was on for too long the whole blade would actually get quite floppy So the question is, how are we going to solve this? Well heating wire is never going to be robust enough and I don't want a red hot spiral I want a red hot lightsaber blade So I think we need to make some sort of solid blade in order for this to work Now some of you guys suggested using titanium which is an interesting idea Now I happen to have some titanium right here, so let's try running a whole bunch of electricity through it And see what happens We have a lithium ion battery pack over here Capable of putting out over 2000 AMPS at 12 volts Alright so we've connected the battery pack negative terminal to the table which means if we connect anything between the positive terminal and the table it's going to spark like crazy And get red hot You guys ready to see some sparks? Well let's see if it goes on forever. Maybe we just created perpetual motion It's done That was cool Alright as you can see the titanium is getting red hot It actually glows quite nicely on the camera screen but the problem is once the titanium is this red hot It's actually pretty soft As you can see that's not quite going to work for the lightsaber blade because if we were to hit something it would just flop around So titanium might be a great element for heating the lightsaber but it's not going to be strong enough For it to do anything fun, as you can see So why don't we try a different material Got a piece of tungsten here Now tungsten is an interesting material because it has one of the highest melting points of any metal on earth that's safe to use around 3600 Celsius but it's also going to draw a lot more current And the reason tungsten will draw much more power is because it's actually much more conductive About 10x as conductive as titanium So let's see what happens if  I short it out we're maxing out our current meter So it's drawing a ton of power right now It's getting super red hot but look it's also smoking like crazy That's because tungsten actually oxidizes rapidly with heat like this which also makes it not great for the light saber So can't use tungsten, can't use titanium What if we use a hybrid of both materials? What if we use a tungsten core with a titanium pipe over top I have a piece of titanium pipe here and a tungsten rod And if I put it inside Now we have a titanium blade with a tungsten core Now the tungsten should be able to keep the lightsaber nice and rigid While the titanium is red hot Here's some footage from one of our first tests a few months ago Elena! What is this? Bogdan! What is this? Hey I'm not the project manager on this So as you can see the tungsten titanium blade looks like it's going to work So let's go back to Solidworks and start designing this new blade architecture. Alright so this is our original Solidworks design for our lightsaber mark 2 Let's just delete some of the things we don't need Like this, and this, and that And now we can start designing the new blade If you want to download the 3D models become a Hacksmith member today By clicking the join button right next to the subscribe button below this video we also post our videos early for you to watch before anyone else Alright so there you go we've got the design finished in Solidworks and I gotta say it looks pretty awesome We kind of went all out there with the handle design and I think it looks pretty sweet Now a few of you might be wondering how is this actually going to work How can we have electricity flow up and down a single blade Well how we're actually going that is this is the piece of tungsten and the tungsten is actually going to be covered in a ceramic insulation which means the current will actually flow up the tungsten to the tip and then back down the titanium that means the titanium will get red hot while the tungsten does not and then that means we've got a lightsaber that's both rigid and super hot this is actually going to be a lot hotter than the last version we made because titanium has a higher melting point than Nitinol now the only issue is we kind of got a bit carried away with the design See this beautiful handle? We don't actually have the tools or resources to make that in house but luckily our industry partner Tormach offered to make it for us themselves on one of their larger machines with a fourth axis Alright big thank you to Tormach for helping us machine the hilt to the lightsaber luckily all the other pieces we need to manufacture we can make right here in house using our CNC Lathe and our CNC mill Let's get started We're going to wrap the wire in high temperature fiber glass so that it doesn't burn if you hit it with the lightsaber this video has been sponsored by Frame.io We first started using Frame.io after Grant Thompson, the King of Random recommended it to us about 6 months ago since then we've been using it daily we liked it so much that we actually reached out to Frame.io and got them to sponsor this video Frame.io is an amazing tool that let's you collaborate on video you can comment with specific time stamps, draw right on the screen, manage versions, share cuts and even bring all your feedback right into the editing software support the channel by clicking my link in the description below you can sign up for a free account or try out the pro plan for 30 days Now I'd like to tell you guys about channel memberships It's a new feature on youtube that allows you to support your favorite creator and gain access to exclusive benefits it's kind of like patreon but it's built right here into Youtube by clicking the join button under this video you get access to our members only community posts which includes 3D project design files in Solidworks, merch discounts and you get to collaborate with us on our videos using Frame.io it costs $5 a month which is basically like buying me a coffee and if everyone bought me coffee I'd never sleep and I'd get way more work done It's a win win situation So this is lgihtsaber mark 3 and we're finally ready to test We've got our battery pack here, we got some volt meters measuring both the voltage and the current draw and we're just about ready to turn it on but I wanna just show you guys this handle up close so Tormach actually machined this for us and they did a fantastic job it's a one of a kind Hacksmith lightsaber hilt So Ian is going to stand over here to pull the wires in case of another fire, Elena! So hopefully it doesn't happen this time I'm scared, it's going to draw like over 1000 AMPS 24 volts 1000 AMPS, that's 24 Kilo watts that's half the supply of electricity that goes into most north American homes You confident Ian? 600, 500 350 It's hot there, it's smoking oh ya That's beautiful look at that! love it 280 You can feel the heat Ya this is warm that's perfect though Even the tip is red hot The tungsten is hot, that's what's smoking So I've turned it off It's just cooling down now When you're not close and you don't feel the heat it just looks like orange metal and then you bring it closer to your face and you're like oh It just looks normal but now it's still really really hot It's pretty solid, it's not flopping around or anything bring me a head! look at that hole what a clean cut alright so we filmed this cringy reenactment from Star Wars episode 4 that no one should ever watch for any reason but if you want to watch it than head on over to the Vlog channel or click this video here Alright so that wraps up this part of the lightsaber build we still have to build a protosaber battery backpack before we can completely finish this but we have some awesome tests lined up that are coming out very soon so make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell plus you know we're going to have to make a second lightsaber so we can actually have a lightsaber dual", "RtRbzJWRDNI": "- [J] This video will contain spoilers for \"The Mandalorian,\"\nchapters one through nine. Hey, brother! Yes, yes, yes! \"The Mandalorian\" is a back on Disney+ and it is picking up exactly where it left off in its epicness. I mean, not even five minutes in, and we're launching whistling birds and Baby Yoda's being as adorable as ever, as if he could never not be. That is the way. But we're back on Tatooine, we're meeting up with random allies who were wearing Boba Fett's armor. And we're fighting giant monsters. I love fighting giant monsters! Give me the old one, two. That was a really bad punch. And, and I am certain\nthat a clue was dropped that the Mandalorian himself is going to be getting\nhis very own lightsaber. (epic music) - [J and Ben] Hey, brother. - Guys, before we dive on in today, we have a fun announcement\nfrom Carlin Brothers Coffee, and it is great news. Hot chocolate is back. You guys blew us away last year, and this stuff sold out super fast. But we came back this\nyear locked and loaded. We have more inventory and a new flavor. So in addition to our Double\nDouble Chocolate Chocolate, we will also have Salted\nSalted Caramel Caramel. Although to be clear,\nit is only salted once, I just repeated it 'cause that was like this like groove with the pattern, with the Double Double\nChocolate Chocolate. You get it. Both of these flavors\nare available right now over at carlinbrotherscoffee.com. And also pro tip, if you take a scoop of either of these and add it to just your regular cup of Carlin Brothers Coffee, it makes an amazing mocha. And don't forget that\nwhile you're over there, for every order on\ncarlinbrotherscoffee.com, we donate one meal to the Feya Foundation. So you can help others\nwhile you treat yourself. Again, Double Chocolate and Salted Caramel available right now over at\ncarlinbrotherscoffee.com. Link is in the description down below. Do you say car-mel or cara-mel? - [Ben] Both?\n- I think I interchange them. Okay, so at the end of season one, we saw Moff Gideon emerge from the wreckage of his TIE Fighter by unsheathing the Darksaber, which left many people wondering like, \"What in the Force is that? \"Is that a black lightsaber? \"Is that allowed?\" And yes, that is exactly what it is, and it is totally allowed. The Darksaber is truly one of a kind. Not only is it the only black\nlightsaber in existence, but it also appears to have\nlike a true edge to it, as opposed to most lightsabers, which just look like,\nyou know, glowing sticks. But don't let me undersell it, I mean, glowing sticks are awesome. If they come out with\nthose things in real life, like, you know, set me up. That said, though, if you follow \"Star Wars\" much\noutside of just the movies, you probably weren't too\nsurprised to see the Darksaber show up in a show called\n\"The Mandalorian.\" And that is because the Darksaber is just as unique as its\noriginal owner and creator, a guy named Tarre Vizsla, who was the first ever\nMandalorian inducted into the Jedi order. Which might not sound\nlike that big of a deal, but the Jedi and the Mandalorian don't exactly have a very peaceful past and have fought against\neach other in many wars, specifically the Star Wars. They're all Star Wars. But in fact, the reason The Mandalorians\nhave such crazy armor, which are armed to the teeth, so many gadgets and gizmos\nand surprise weaponry was because they were fighting the Jedi and needed to come up with creative ways to counter their use of the Force and their supernatural abilities. So the fact that Tarre\nVizsla somehow existed as both a Jedi and a Mandalorian stood out as much as the unique weapon he created. After his death, though, the Darksaber was kept at the Jedi temple until that is his clan, House Vizsla, broke in and stole it back. And then subsequently used\nit to unite their people and rule over all of\nMandalore as the Mand'alor. Mand'alor is mand apostrophe alor, and is the title given to the sole leader of all of Mandalore, get it? That's not confusing at all. But anyway, getting back to the show, since Mando is traveling with Baby Yoda, and the two were so obviously connected, I felt pretty sure that Mando was going to be the one to end\nup with the Darksaber. That he and Baby Yoda would symbolically represent Tarre Vizsla and be the physical embodiments of both the Jedi and\nthe Mandalorian Codes. The truest believers of each. That they would claim the Darksaber and reunite the scattered Conclaves and restore Mandalore to its former glory. But here's the thing. What good is having just one lightsaber in a \"Star Wars\" story? I mean, I mean, I mean, you can't have much of a lightsaber battle with just one, right? I agree, you cannot. And I paid the math budget this month, and the dance budget, and it turns out that\nyou need two to tango. In fact, we had a little\nbit leftover for this. But that's it. Which is not to say it wouldn't be fun to see Mando go up against the Darksaber and have to defeat it using only his cunning and his tricky\nweaponry, but let's face it. This is \"Star Wars.\" And despite the lack of any Jedi, you know they want to\nhave a lightsaber battle. And originally I thought\nthey were going to solve this by introducing Ahsoka this season. We know she is slated to show up in person for the first time ever\nduring a live-action show. And she should be dual-wielding her signature white lightsabers. And like, I literally cannot wait because Ahsoka is just one\nof my favorite characters in all of \"Star Wars.\" But the problem is, she's\nprobably a little too powerful. And that's an issue at least\nas far as the show is concerned because once she shows up, it's like, why isn't she just the one\nsolving all the problems? It's like when Captain Marvel shows up at the big fight against Thanos, and it's like, \"Oh, just\ngive it to her,\" right? - Hey Peter Parker, you\ngot something for me? - But Ahsoka is extremely battle-tested, having fought in and won many\nbattles during the Clone Wars. She is very skilled with the Force and an excellent dualist\nwith her lightsabers. So how do you get around her? As long as this weapon has been around, there has been this\naura of power about it. Like it is somehow more\npowerful than other lightsabers. Despite this though, we've seen it participate\nin many lightsaber battles, and it always seems to\nfunction the exact same as any other lightsaber, except it's black. And it's not the only time we've heard about extra powerful lightsabers. Like this is also kind of what they said about Kylo Ren's lightsaber, like that the kyber crystal\ninside of it was unstable, and the reason he needed\nthe exhaust ports was because of all the excess power. But like, what extra power? Like yeah, sure, it looked ragged, and it looked more dangerous, but we never saw it malfunction or allow him to do anything extra that other lightsabers couldn't do. Well, I guess he did burn Finn's\nshoulder that one time, so. But I think this trend could finally break when white meets black. Both colors are completely\nunique thus far. And so nobody really\nknows what would happen if or when they come into\ncontact with each other. Maybe Ahsoka's will overheat or maybe the Darksaber\nwill cut through them or just phase through them or something. I don't know. Other than that, I think black will win because defeating Ahsoka\nwould really mark Moff Gideon as a truly worthy villain. That said, I have a lot\nof trouble believing that Moff Gideon could defeat Ahsoka with a lightsaber just ever,\nlike even with an advantage. But that doesn't mean he might not be able to team up with somebody who\ncould toe-to-toe with her, like, I don't know, Boba Fett? Yeah, so in case you were wondering who this guy is at the end of the episode, you have to do a little math, but it is definitely Boba Fett. This actor is Temuera Morrison who played Jango Fett\nin the prequel trilogy. And in case you need a refresher, Jango was the model they\nused for every soldier in the clone army. And all of the clones were\ngiven a growth hormone to make them grow up faster, except for one who Jango\nraised as his son, Boba. And Boba Fett became the\ngreatest bounty hunter in the entire galaxy and eventually delivered\nHan Solo to Jabba the Hutt and was last seen falling\ninto a Sarlacc pit in \"Return of the Jedi.\" And since then his fate has been unknown, other than presumed dead until now where he is\nobviously on the hunt to get his armor back from Mando. Anyway, point is, he would\nbe an awesome candidate for someone to wield the Darksaber and could also believably defeat Ahsoka. Not that I want her to go down at all, but we know she's going to die eventually because she is one of the\nvoices Rey hears talking to her when she's confronting Palpatine, so. Anyway though, you might be wondering, what does this have to do with Din Djarin, the \"The Mandalorian\"\ngetting his own lightsaber? Glad you ask, and the answer is because\nif Ahsoka goes down, he's going to need his own lightsaber to go up against Moff Gideon or Boba, or whoever's wielding the Darksaber by the end of the season. And they have already\nintroduced the mechanism by which he will acquire one. And that method is the krayt dragon. That's the giant monster that they spent most of\nthe episode fighting, which by the way was awesome. I mean, references to the\nkrayt dragon have been around since like the very first \"Star Wars,\" in \"A New Hope.\" Like you can actually see the bones of one when 3PO and R2 are just like\nrolling through the desert, which is like, ah, what a cool callback. Although for clarity,\nthat's not the same one, the Mando code, because it's taking place\nafter \"Return of the Jedi.\" So different, different krayt dragon. Anyway though, I don't\nknow about you guys, but at the end, when the Tusken\nRaiders were digging through and they found that egg looking thing, I was like, \"Oh my gosh,\nare they going to make this \"like a running joke that the people \"who live in the desert just love the eggs of giant monsters?\" Is this a throwback to the Jawas wanting that hairy egg from the\nrhino thing last season? I almost think that is what\nthey want you to think, that it's just another\negg, but do not be fooled. It is not an egg, that item\nthey're holding up is a pearl. See krayt dragons, as big as they are, sometimes need to consume rocks to help break down the items\nin their stomach for digestion. And in rare cases, one of those stones might\ncontain a kyber crystal, which in case you don't know, is what powers a lightsaber and determines the color and stuff. Anyway, the digestive fluid inside the krayt dragon\nis pretty corrosive and will just break down\nany of the rocks they eat, so they can digest those as well. But they're not strong enough\nto break down a kyber crystal. Instead over the course\nof the dragon's long life, the crystal would be refined\nuntil it became a pearl. And according to \"Gear and Gadgets\" which is the \"Star\nWars\" role-playing game, sort of akin do Dungeons and Dragons, a lightsaber equipped\nwith one of these pearls admitted a very powerful\nand destructive blade that admitted a howling\nsound when ignited. Boom! Extra powerful blade\nthat our main man Mando is going to use to take\ndown the Darksaber. And look, if you don't believe\nme, they didn't show you the Tusken Raiders finding\nthat Pearl for no reason. They didn't linger on\nthat shot for no reason. Even the rhino egg last season, all set up to fake you out, right here. But wait, how's it going to construct it? Don't you need to use the Force\nto construct a lightsaber? Great question, and in fact, yes, you do need to use the Force, which means Baby Yoda's\ngoing to be the one to assemble the lightsaber for I mean, it's going to be adorable. I mean, can't you just\nimagine little Baby Yoda turning on a lightsaber going vroom, and shooting him across\nthe room or something because it's so extra powerful? But how is baby Yoda gonna know how to assemble a lightsaber? Ahsoka! History lesson. How did Ahsoka get her\nfancy white lightsabers? Well, the entire story is revealed in her standalone book \"Ahsoka,\" which surprisingly was\nnot a very fun read. I mean, it was the first\n\"Star Wars\" novel I ever read. And I was like, \"Eh,\nthis was kind of boring.\" Anyway, the way you make red lightsabers is by a Dark Force User\nkilling a, normally Jedi, stealing their kyber crystal, and then corrupting it\nand making it bleed, which is what turns it red. However, in her book, Ahsoka kills an Inquisitor and steals back two of\nthe bleeding crystals and purifies them, which then creates the white lightsabers. But that just accounts for the crystals. What about the hilt? Well, that's the fun part because throughout the book Ahsoka is just sort of randomly collecting bits of spare metal here and there. She doesn't even know what for, she just knows she needs to collect them. But eventually of course, all those spare bits of metal turn out to be the hilts for her new sabers. So I think throughout the\nseason of \"Mandalorian,\" you need to be on lookout\nfor any spare bits of metal that Baby Yoda or Mando are collecting. Personally, I think it will also involve some beskar steel for style. And I will just die of adorableness if that little ball that he kept giving him to\nplay with in season one is also part of the hilt. Like how great would that be? So in the end, it would\nliterally be the unity between Mandalore and the Jedi that creates this unique blade, similar to how the Darksaber was created. And I am just positive that\nthis is going to happen. The only real question I have is, what color do you think it will be? Like also black? That would be awesome. Or maybe green to match Baby\nYoda? Also a good choice. Maybe a new color\naltogether? Would they dare? Let me know your thoughts\non the section down below. One, will he get one and two, what color will it be? I am so excited that there's\nnew \"Star Wars\" stuff. But guys, thanks as always\nfor watching today's video, don't forget to leave a like on it, and if you haven't already and subscribe, so you don't miss any future\n\"Star Wars\" action from us. If you want to see my prediction for the end of the season\nthat Thrawn is coming, you can check out this video right here, but until next time, Ben, I will see you in\nanother life, brother.", "nOKC9dWrrqQ": "hey robot fans welcome back to the channel what you are looking at is the first spin test of my grand inquisitor sabre the coolest lightsaber in all the star wars galaxy this first prototype took a lot of experimentation and a lot of iterations over the past couple months and even though watching it spin for the first time is super cool and rewarding this is just the beginning so let's get started alright so this is great what we have here is a very basic version of the grand inquisitor sabre from star wars rebels at this point it's a pretty dumb version of the sabre in that there's no micro controller or arduino running there's no code there's not even any user input at this point but what we do have is a good example of all the core mechanics working together these gears are rolling the way they're supposed to the blades are spinning the way they're supposed to all the key mechanical components are in their right places and everything is set up to move forward and make this into a smart version of the saber that's going to have custom circuit boards and code running and safety features battery charging user input and all of that stuff jammed into this small little package here but all of that starts with getting these core components correct so that's what this video is going to focus on we're going to go right back to the beginning start with the lazy susan bearing which is the start of it all and build this back up to this point the lazy susan is a rockler type bearing and this is what's going to give us our rotation i modified this a bit by drilling all of these holes to do that i took all the ball bearings out and then i made some 3d printed drill guides which i used to drill and tap various size mounting holes all around the inner and outer susans and i also re-greased all of the bearings to make it nice and smooth spins really fast much better than it does right out of the box the motor for this project is going to be this 1621 rpm heavy duty planetary gear motor from servo city this is a pretty beefy motor probably beefier than we need but i'm kind of locked in with the size of this lazy susan and i saw when i built it out in my 3d program that the motor fit and the batteries fit so i figured i'd rather have that power and not need it then knead it and not have it so we're going to go with this motor and the trickiest part here is with the motor sitting inside of the lazy susan inside the hilt we need to transfer the rotation of the motor to 90 degrees so that it can rotate this and to do that we are going to use some bevel gears i've done some previous iterations of the saber using a 2 1 bevel gear ratio so this would be on the motor and then it would spin this and obviously this has twice as many teeth so it would cut the rpms down in half so this is a 1621 rpm motor this two to one ratio would cut that down to about 800 rpm and in my previous iterations the gearing going around here was an eight to one ratio so all of a sudden that 1600 rpms goes down to 100 and the motor isn't the whole saber isn't spinning quite as fast as i would like there's plenty of torque and it was uh it was very torquey but it wasn't spinning as fast as i thought it could and i think the fast spin is what's going to make this project super cool so i did a little digging and i found a one one-to-one miter gear set which i'm going to use on this iteration i also 3d printed a plastic gear to put on there and this one to one gear is going to transfer the 1621 rpms directly to the 8 to 1 gear ratio going around the lazy susan and that'll leave us with about 200 rpms with no load for the saber and that's going to be really really really fast we've gone from not quite fast enough to maybe a little too fast but i think i think that's okay and here is that gearing rigged up for the lazy susan we have the one-to-one bevel gear in there and that is attached to a plastic 3d printed gear i have it all rigged up with some aluminum some other 3d printed parts and some super high-tech velcro that's all temporary so that's not really important the real important bit is this gear which is kind of overlapping the lazy susan a bit and now we can add a larger gear going to the outer susan which will give us our rotation unfortunately my 3d printers are too small to print the outer gear in one piece and i didn't want poor assembly of several pieces of a gear to hinder the test so i'm using my spanking new x-carve to carve a wooden gear out of some plywood okay i've got this all rigged up onto the lazy susan so if we turn it on you can see we get our rotation so this is great because this kind of gets me back to a point that i had been with previous iterations only now we have the correct gearing on there and we're in a better position to move forward um you may be looking at this and thinking to yourself wow that's not spinning really really fast like you said it was going to be and that is because we are currently only running four and a half volts into this motor which is a 12 volt motor so you can see if we start turning up the voltage so this is where 12 volts puts us now i'm not saying i'm scared of this thing but uh and yeah let's see if we can take this one step further and the way we're going to do that is by adding in one of the more successful parts of my previous iteration the blades these are super bright neopixel blades and this is the actual weight that's going to be on the outer saber so there's no better way to test it than to rig these guys up and that kind of gets us right back to where we started at the beginning of this video with our first real blade spin test all right we're ready to run our first test with the uh with the big gear attached to the outer susan and the blades attached i did some preliminary tests off-camera and this thing has a little bit of a kick to it so we're going to start pretty low we're going to start around 3 volts and we're going to slowly work our way up so if we kick on the 3 volts yeah you can see this is uh it's cool but it could be a lot cooler right so as we ramp up the voltage so this is about five volts i'm noticing that if i don't keep it totally steady if i lean my if i roll my hand forward or backwards a little bit the whole thing starts to wobble really really intensely so if we turn it up just a little bit more oh i turned it down we turned it up more okay now we're getting into a speed that this is kind of what i was hoping for originally and this speed is happening at eight and a half volts so this is kind of like my ideal speed but it's nice to know that we still have four more volts that we can go up to what's cool is i could hear the blades going past me i can hear them like a fan going it kicks a lot as you turn the speed up so if we go up to its final destination here at about 12 volts wow it's like really fast this is probably faster than i'll ever get it for real but it's nice to know that we can go this high it feels kind of stable it feels secure it's not quite as scary as i thought it was gonna be that being said it's still pretty fast so let's bring it back down okay safe manageable speed here and i'm gonna kick this off this thing's gonna get heavier and it's already kind of hard to hold it in that one position for so long i'm also kind of bound up by wires here but it's a pretty cool little thing okay so my original plan was to end the video with that test but feeling that kick from the motor when i was turning it on it's starting to get me to really wonder how much of a kick there's going to be when this thing has a lot more weight on it so i wanted to do one more test with a little weight around the outside of the saber and since these are these blades are already wired up here and here i figured i might as well do the test that we all really want i made a little a little bit of a brain here this is just enough just enough battery power and just enough computing power to run these sabers for about five minutes before the batteries die so we can put that here and then i have a matching counter weight at the bottom these two weigh the exact same thing i'm realizing how much of a wobble can build up inside of the saber so having this weight perfectly balanced will be good and this is going to add about about 12 ounces to this whole thing so i i should hopefully get a bit of an idea of how much the kick is going to be increasing with the weight and that's going to lead me into deciding how to speed control this thing etc etc but for now what we're really going to get out of all this is a cool test with the blades on [Music] so this is awesome getting to this point after working on this project for so long is really satisfying the end goal of this project is to have a fully functional fully contained spinning lightsaber with lights sounds everything and no external wires everything built right into the hills so be sure to check back or subscribe to get notified of the next video where we're going to start building the actual circuits that's going to make this thing possible alright i'll see you guys next [Music] time [Music] you", "QbR0xZK3aj8": "what is up my friends welcome back to another lightsaber roulette video and today we are taking a look at count dooku's legacy lightsaber from star wars galaxy's edge let's get to this for those of you returning thank you for joining me for another lightsaber roulette video if this is your first time on the channel we do a lot of talk about collecting from everything from toys to figures to statues and we do it all right but me i love star wars and that's what i like to talk about the most and that's what i'm doing right here so if you like star wars as much as i do please like subscribe and turn on notifications so you can stay up to date on all the content all right so about a month ago maybe less i did an unboxing of the hasbro black series force fx count dooku lightsaber and i thought it was pretty cool the one thing that i don't like about the forcefx lightsabers is that the blade cannot be removed and i don't display my lightsabers with the blades or the batteries installed on them so you know it just wasn't my type of thing um i mentioned in the video that i was going to try to find a way to possibly get it removed i think a couple of people in the chat mentioned to me where i could do that but then i got win from a friend of disney that they were coming out with the legacy version which that means no blade installed and i was like cool i can go that route so i sold the other lightsaber and now i have this one so that's what i did so i'm happy to have this one in the house right now without further ado let's get this thing unboxed and see what it looks like all right so pretty happy that i don't have to take and destroy a lightsaber like a forcefx and somebody else can enjoy it and i can just have this as i want it without the blade that looks cool that looks pretty dope all right let me show you guys i like it there you go you guys can check it out pretty cool like i said with the other video if you guys didn't see my video earlier this week i did one on the ahsoka tano uh lightsabers from the clone wars um comes in a box just like this from legacy from the legacy from the legacy series uh line this is only can only be had at star wars galaxy's edge i like the display boxes i think they're really cool this one has that separatist logo on it which is dope um you know what's cool about these is that you know you can take and and you can display it like this if you want to you know you don't have to have them up on a wall like i have it you know you can take and display them like this and just have them lined up that's what you want to do it has a nice little you know display factor to it so i think it's cool all right so let's see how this thing feels in my hand man this is weighty and thick it's got a chunk to it man all right pretty cool very elegant i like all of the gloss on it let me get you guys up close and personal so you can see how this thing looks in all of the detail all right so there it is you can see that it is kind of on the chunky side it's definitely big uh i used to have the master replicas version of this and i remember it being i think it's in in proportion but i just think overall it's bigger just feels bigger it's got a lot of weight to it which is cool you can see where the emitter goes in where the blade goes into the emitter i mean um like the grip on it and everything the detail on that's really cool let me get you guys even closer with this you can see it and you just focus focus there it is all right so you can see the detail on it really nice i love the shine here that is really good i think they did a good job with that so it's got this kind of chrome feel to it ignore the thumb prints all of this is just thumb prints for me really digging the texture here on the grip i mean just look at that it's very nicely done i love the gold accents and everything i wish this was the switch but it's not it's got the switch right here uh right there that's where your switch is all right again just like with ahsoka's lightsaber it doesn't make a sound if there's no blade in it so you don't even get that kind of like twitching sound that you would get and then there's the uh pommel area which is really cool i think that's where you put the batteries in so i think very nice overall design just you know very chunky and very weighty lightsabers it's got a lot of weight to it so i like that aspect of it anyway i always like the lightsabers to have a little weight to it makes it feel more like quality so overall i like the design all right so let's see how the batteries go in this okay so it looks like a twist off back here that's very similar to the to the black series version and then it looks like it takes triple a's it could be tripolis tell you right now for certain yeah it takes aaa batteries so it takes three aaa batteries when you buy them at disney they give you batteries installed on them i think it's because they want you to run around the park and play with them so there you go put that over here all right and then there's a slot here you can see where there's a slot there and that goes in this way so it's going to slide in like that so you want to make sure that you get that and right hopefully there's only one way to go that way kind of weird the way they designed that so you want to go in there in there like swimwear and then you spin there goes all locked up all right so let's get a blade installed in this and we'll see how the light up features work alright we got a blade so just like with all of the legacy lightsabers you have a emitter cap that you take out and then this easily slides right in and it makes that noise when it gets put into place so that's it that's the installation let me kill the lights and let's see the light up features and the sound effects and see how that looks it's got a nice hum to it sound sounds pretty good uh not unlike any of the other lightsabers that i've heard so it's nothing special about that i think ahsoka's had a really nice you know variation to the sound this one doesn't really have that so that's pretty cool the light up feature doesn't have that you know nice smooth action that the palpatine has and it goes up but it does have an upward action when it ignites and then somewhat of a down when it goes down so it's not bad not bad at all all right as far as sensitivity it's almost delayed yeah not feeling that it's like almost no sound at all look at this can't even hear anything right see the strike motion they get the strike down so that's cool but you don't really get much sound as far as the swinging effect goes at least in the room so um that's kind of a downer but let's take it outside and see put it to the test see if i put it through some swings maybe it'll sound a little bit more but right now i'm pretty much doubt that all right let's see how this works all right so just like i thought the sensitivity in the swing is not there at all just whipping around and gets more of like a striking attack seems like the striking attack was what works the best but it doesn't you saw there even one half when i uh when i whipped it around too quickly and i hit the tree um yeah just it doesn't seem like like you get a good sensitivity in the swing at all with these sabers these are just really meant for for looks and for the fun of having the light up uh like for like say going cosplay or uh or maybe like even halloween so yeah that was the swing test all right so there you have it the swing test the sensitivity test is just like i've had with pretty much every single lightsaber that i get either from the parks or from uh hasbro there's pretty much no sound in the swing i really think they need to get that down especially with the price of these lightsabers would be nice if you could at least have the motion when you swing up and down or around like that that you get that won wong that kind of sound effect like that yeah that's pretty cool right uh yeah it would be cool if they had that they got the strike motion down which i think is cool i think the overall design of the hilt i think is fantastic it is a little bit oversized compared to the one that i remember having from master replicas you could probably get something that is more uh accurate to size like i said in other videos from like sabre forge or corbath or you know kr sabres one of those guys will probably have a more uh accurately sized lightsaber but you know for 129 which is what this one cost in the park you can't beat that i mean it's not this is a very inexpensive way for you to have a lightsaber on display and that's the way i'm going to display it is just the hilt by itself i don't need to have the hilt with the with the blade installed uh so i like that a lot that they're now having this um the switch location in my opinion i think is awkward would have been cool if this was the switch here in the back you know it's i think i remember this having the same issue with the black series version it's a very weird flick that you have to go up in order to get the blade uh to ignite so overall i'm happy with it it looks cool you know so that that's the thing that i like you know the hilt looks really good so that's what's important uh for you know those of you guys that are into collecting lightsabers or just getting started into collecting lightsabers this is a good inexpensive budget lightsaber that gives you all of the feels all of the look of the movie and if that's what you're looking for this is a good way to get into that you know if you want to you know go into a higher end version like i said with sabreforge or core math or something like that you can be easily upwards of 500 or more trying to get something that looks like this and you know have ignition uh light up features like that and special effects so yeah i mean i'm happy and that's what matters so as always guys i'm going to hear what you guys think what do you guys think about the new count dooku legacy lightsaber let me know in the comments below and until next time guys may the force be with you and keep it marvelous make my own side effects [Music] you", "XwqkCteKUWY": "hello there what's going on everyone today we've got a real big treat because we're going to be unboxing and taking a look at the darth revan force fx

other lightsabers this is the first elite lightsaber that i am taking a look at so it's gonna be interesting to take a look at this and comparing this to uh some of the other black series regular lightsabers also maybe like the build a saber or the deluxe sabres from disney galaxy's edge uh i am orlando based so i've had the privilege of being able to go to galaxy's edge before the pandemic and uh and kind of build a lightsaber and pick up some of the replica lightsabers they have there uh it's gonna be nice to see where this one measures up uh if you do like what you see i do invite you to subscribe uh not just for the giveaway but also for more star wars content i do a lot of uh replicas lightsabers helmets also a lot of gaming star wars gaming other types of tabletop games as well uh so definitely click the links down in the description for more information or i will also put some links over here at the end of the video with all that being said let's go ahead and take a look at this thing all right here is the saber out of the box it's very shiny there's a lot of detailing here so let's just look at the hilt a little bit um we've got well usually you'll see something like like fake buttons these are actually real buttons and you can see it's it's actually making a sound trying to like turn it on but uh but it can't turn on because there's no blade inserted right now but uh but some pretty good detailing on here uh very kind of like rough cut uh pieces on the side not the most comfortable to hold and it's also very very light compared to a lot of the other sabers especially the uh the disney savers that i expected this would be kind of like especially with the supposedly removable kyber crystal by the way i already stuck it in but here's the kyber crystal it's kind of uh clear but when you stick it in it kind of lights up it's weird we're gonna i'm gonna show you that here in a minute um these top pieces actually come out so you can kind of change it up a little bit but you need to pull them out in order to unscrew the top here and when you do this this is going to have two different pieces also i want to point out this takes double a batteries which is very different than most of the other black series they usually take triple a's it's not since like the uh i don't know if it's been like three or four years since they were making them where they all took uh double a's a whole different type of uh piece in the back here i'll even show you guys real quick um the back um when that takes the double a's uh you see instead of triple a's and yes i'm using best buy batteries because they are super cheap compared to regular other batteries okay and there we go and plus all these collectibles they go through a lot of batteries all right so that's going to keep making the the sounds there so this is kind of wide open now one of the things you can do is you can stick this in here so i'm going to go in one way and then we just put this over the top oh actually you can i think you can put this on there also and you can screw that in and one of the what that's going to do is it's going to give you you're going to be able to see the light right and it looks like it's kind of red it's not going to shine out too brightly though um and it's just if you wanted a little bit of lightness and if you supposedly if you hold both buttons it changes colors it looks like it just changed on me briefly i'm pushing just the green button pushing the red button now like it changed for a second there i don't know i don't it's not it's not really i don't know nothing's actually changing the color red doesn't change it green doesn't change it both red and green yeah it says if you hold the red and green it's going to change the color but it doesn't that's weird but now when i take it out and i'm dropping pieces here you can see like there you go you see like it still gets got a red glow there's no battery in here so i guess it just siphons a little bit of the power and um it does that so let's go ahead and um now cool thing about this is this blade here is almost identical to the blades that you get at the uh galaxy's edge with the removable blades the only difference is this bottom part is different and that makes it where it won't exactly fit like it fits almost all of the way but the connectors actually won't fully connect so um so don't put don't like if you have a galaxy's edge saver don't try and force it on there it's not going to go all the way all right so i'll put this on all right there we go i got that in i'm going to close that up and now let's let's fire it up okay it just turned itself off um let's try again and no okay this is i feel like this blade like if it's not pushed in like really really hard all the way it's gonna become loose and so i'm gonna try and push it in like really hard no all right i'm gonna try and hold it in as hard as i can there he goes i'm like i'm forcing it down it's got like a almost like a half a centimeter of give on how i can push it you see and and it goes on and wow that almost looks that looks nsfw right there um this is actually kind of disappointing that that's like gonna become dislodged really easily and then when it's not fully connected it doesn't work what is this man all right well hold on let me play around with it some more the problem with this saber right here is like i have it in you put it in oh no it's working but you see it's got a little bit of room it's got like wiggle room in inside the casing here and and of course i don't have the ring attached right now but and now it seems to be working just fine but it's not supposed to go white like that either um but yeah it's just it's like so loose maybe i just got a bad one i don't know i can only review what i got and this thing is like over two hundred dollars this was very expensive so i think it's like 250 um and it's really unfortunate to have a lightsaber that doesn't work look at that so i i have no idea man i don't know what to say other than this is really an expensive piece of junk um maybe maybe if i put something underneath here i can like some rolled up some tissue paper and put it underneath there it's like so when i screw this down it'll force the bottom part down a little bit more um i shouldn't have to do that and people by spending almost 300 on a lightsaber shouldn't have to do that at all uh wow i think i've got it figured out i took uh some paper it was part of the little electronic like attention you know don't electrocute yourself paper so i rolled up a bunch of like thin paper got it underneath there slid the ring on top it should hold it in place now and now that i've forced the blade down all the way i guess i can at least continue the review um spoilers it's not going to be a good review if i had to do this but we'll go around with the rest of it maybe i just got a bad one um maybe you know if anybody from hasbro is watching is this how it's supposed to be is this how your products are supposed to be or did i just get a bad one let me know i would love to do a follow-up video but let's do uh let's take a look at the rest of the functionality here all right so i i turned the lights down just a little so you can see the blade a little better i'm gonna turn it on hopefully it works this time with the paper in there all right so it's working for now um but it's got a nice glow to it um it's turning turning off on its own and and it's doing that so this is still this is still really annoying but it has some functionality like if it would work uh we could actually see what the buttons do and that's what i want to show you here um okay all right so i don't know if i'm gonna be able to spin it and have it do its fancy effects or not but there you can bump the hilt a little bit and it kind of flashes turns off when it's flashing which is really weird now if you hold uh the green button you're going to get this like cutting through a door type of effect so that's pretty cool uh i i like that and it also generates the sound effect so you can hear it and it just shut off again on me this is really uh uh poorly poorly designed piece right here i i don't even know what to say it's it's so loose it's got so much can you hear that it's got so much give i'm gonna have to stick more paper in there i guess um but i'm gonna hold it down so we can actually demonstrate the effects a little bit closer i want you to see the way that it's supposed to work it's actually kind of rainbow colors when you have that that hold-in effect going now if i hold both buttons it's a shame that i have to hold the blade in while i'm doing this but and now it's just turned red that's pretty cool as i'm holding the blade in we can there we go we can see that the effects with me holding the blade forcibly downward it actually seems to work so you know that's i guess the only way to do it um and of course we can do the same kind of cutting through effect by holding the green button and then if we hold the buttons again it turns back to the purple so that's a pretty cool uh potential except it just keeps coming loose and coming out on its own really disappointed really disappointed with this thing okay and the last thing i want to show you is the stand there was a little piece that comes out that slides right into here and you can just kind of rest the hilt in there and put one of the side panels here into this little grip and that's going to go in pretty easily and there you go and you can display it like so um that's uh much is pretty nice i currently have it uh with the uh the crystal in there so again we turn on and there it goes it's it's oh it won't even it doesn't even recognize the crystal being in there anymore so yeah it's uh i don't know what's wrong with this one but uh that's it's really kind of a kind of a shame that it and it didn't do more it's uh that that sound effect is pretty much equivalent to my review every other product has been significantly better than this one i really hope that i just got a bad one um and uh you know what i'll probably reach out to hasbro and see if uh they have anything to say um maybe that i can get a replacement i don't know because this is uh this is unfortunate uh i usually expect a lot better especially for this price point too um so let me know what you guys think um if yeah that's that's about all i've got for today um i'm a little disappointed because this has some potentially really cool features this would have been probably my favorite um lightsaber to to play with and you know like i don't just set them up for display i play with them i play with the kids the kids would had a good time with this one too and yes i do let my kids touch my lightsabers when they're supervised i let them play you know we'll turn out the lights in the garage we'll go out in the backyard and we'll play lightsabers and and we have a good time with it what's the point of having awesome toys if you can't enjoy them with your family that's that's what i i mean maybe you just like to display them whatever you want to do they're good for that this is actually a really nice stand like i really like the stand i i really like the hilt i like that it's got two buttons and they both work um you know provisionally uh i i like the removable blade i like the uh even though the kyber crystal i'm a little disappointed that the kyber crystal you don't actually swap it out to change it you just push buttons but uh you know it's it's an extra little feature you know i thought it was going to be more of like an open the chamber and put the crystal in there but um ultimately like as long as the blade were to fit i think it would be an awesome lightsaber but it just the blade doesn't really go in there all the way and that's that's terribly disappointing and that's going to do it for the review if you like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up i mean thumbs up for the video not necessarily for the product but uh you know i expect to get a lot of thumbs downs because people might think that that you know they're thumbs-downing the saber but that actually hurts me so if you like the review or the way i'm talking about it the honesty in the review uh you go give the video a thumbs up let me know what you think

Now just add up all the points from the questions\nand we'll find out which result you have in the Star Wars universe. Between 10 and 13: You got the Proto-saber. The Proto-saber was an ancient prototype lightsaber\nthat was held in an Imperial base. The proto-saber functioned differently from\nstandard lightsabers. Instead of emitting a plasma blade, the proto-saber\nfeatured two physical prongs which rose up from a crossguard, though without the vent\nthat typical crossguard lightsabers When ignited, white energy would light up between the two\nprongs. Users of the proto-saber were known to be\nold-fashioned. Between 14 and 17: You got the Lightsaber\nPike. Lightsaber pikes were staff shaped double\nbladed lightsabers, although with much longer and thicker hilts. Some lightsaber pikes had a haft that when\nactivated emitted a shoto blade that made it two to three meters long. Users of the lightsaber pike believed in justice\nand order above all. Between 18 and 21: You got the Lightsaber\nPistol This type of lightsaber was a single-bladed\nlightsaber, with an attachment that allowed it to also work as a blaster. It\u2019s design would help an individual to\nconceal their force sensitivity. Users of the lightsaber pistol were typically\nmore secretive. Ideally they prefer to refrain from confrontation\naltogether, however if that is unavoidable, users of this style of saber prefer to deal\nwith it in passive ways. Between 22 and 26: You got the Shoto-style\nLightsaber These lightsabers were a variation of the\nsingle-bladed sabers, with shorter blades and hilts. Typically used for a secondary weapon, or\na main weapon for wielders of shorter stature. Users of this style of saber would typically\nprefer to avoid combat unless necessary, and would instead utilize Force powers to resolve\nthe situation. For these reasons, users of the shoto-style\nsaber were often highly skilled in Force abilities. Between 27 and 31: You got the Cane-Disguised\nlightsaber. The cane disguised lightsaber was similar\nto any other lightsaber, although the hilt is concealed as the handle of a cane. The handle could detach, and then the saber\ncould be used normally in combat. Users of the cane-disguised saber were known\nto be sneaky and deceptive. Between 32 and 36: You got the Curved-Hilt\nLightsaber This lightsaber was similar to that of a standard\nsingle-blade, except it would feature a curve in the hilt. Users prefer to use one-handed fighting styles,\ntherefore the shape of this style helps them to grasp the saber better. It would also allow for greater accuracy and\nfinesse during combat. Users are often calm and do not look for fights,\nhowever when they do engage in combat, they show great control over the situation. Between 37 and 47: You got the Standard Single-bladed\nLightsaber The most common lightsaber variation, it\u2019s\nthe typical hilt style of the Jedi and Sith. Users of this style prefer a more traditional,\ndirect way of completing your tasks, and they don\u2019t shy away from confrontations. They like to think before you act and that's\nwhy some of the strongest Jedi and Sith known in the universe use a standard single bladed\nlightsaber. Between 48 and 52: You got the Crossguard\nLightsaber This three-blade design included a standard\nblade, with two perpendicular shorter blades that would act as vents. Users of this style of saber often craved\nmore power and would use manipulated crystals to help gain it. When confronted with a situation, their emotions\ntypically fuelled their actions. Therefore they are usually regarded as unpredictable. Between 53 and 57: You got the Dual-Phase\nlightsaber. The Dual-phase lightsaber was a lightsaber\nstyle that contained multiple kyber crystals, which would allow for the user to change the\nblade length to be extended or shortened in the middle of combat. This generally caused an opponent's guard\nto falter momentarily as they adjusted to the new blade length, allowing the wielder\nto press the advantage while their opponent was confused. Users of the dual-phase lightsaber were known\nto be devious and conflicted. Between 58 and 61: You got the Double-Bladed\nLightsaber This lightsaber was an extra long hilt with\na blade on each end, and could often be split into two separate lightsabers from the center. The double-bladed lightsaber primarily allowed\nfor a faster rate of attack, being able to unleash a rapid assault with minimum movement. Users of this weapon liked confrontation,\nand were often more interested in combat. Therefore, they would rather ignite their\nlightsaber than use the Force. Between 62 and 65: You got the Double-Bladed\nHinged Lightsaber This lightsaber design was similar to the\ndouble bladed lightsaber. It was essentially two single bladed lightsabers\njoined together by a hinge at their pommels. The double-bladed hinged lightsaber allowed\nfor greater portability while being carried on the user's belt. Wielders could activate one or both blades\nwhile the weapon was still folded. Between 66 and 70: You got the Double-bladed\nSpinning Lightsaber This lightsaber design was similar to the\ndouble-bladed lightsaber, except it had a shorter hilt that was surrounded by a circular\nrim that could spin the blades along a track. Users of this lightsaber style were typically\nquite aggressive in nature, as such a modification was used mainly for intimidation. Users of this lightsaber are thought to be\nhighly trained in combat, as mastering this hilt was not easy. Interested in finding out more about who you\u2019d\nbe in the Star Wars Universe.

I hope to see you all again in Leia\u2019s Lair.", "COlG_j6dJoQ": "some FORSCOM is one of the world's leading lightsaber manufacturers they are known for their high level of quality and customization unfortunately they're also known for their terrible customer service people waited up to 10 months to get their orders so how did I get mine in just three weeks hello there and welcome to star wars in real life well we makes ours a reality by covering things like Star Wars toys and games events and cosplay because stores just makes life better even if other people don't quite understand it like saber forge dot-com who doesn't understand that I needed a lightsaber right now god damn it not ten months from now what so here's some backstory I'm going to start with celebration on April 10th and a few weeks ago I started on my very first cosplay project ever where I'm gonna be dressing up as Ezra Bridger from seasons 3 and 4 of rebels oh by the way if you're interested in following me on my cosplaying journey be sure to check out this playlist up here I'm gonna be uploading tons of videos of me making Ezra's shirt his armor boots all of that stuff so definitely check it out one of the very first things I did was check online to see a who even makes an exact replica of Ezra's green lightsaber and be how quickly can I get it because at the time I only had six weeks left until celebration so everything from placing the order to it arriving at my house needed to take place within six weeks otherwise I'd have to figure something else out which probably would have involved trying to make my own lightsaber which probably would have involved me giving up on the entire project okay so first of all who even makes an exact replica of Ezra's green lightsaber like most of the problems of my life I started by searching on Google for a solution but the only thing that came up was that cheap plastic toy like staple gun type of lightsaber that Ezra had in seasons 1 and 2 you know the blue one and that's not what I needed at all you know Google can be great when you find exactly what it is you're looking for but when you can't oh it could be frustrating so then made a list of every lightsaber manufacturer that I could think of ultra sabers Vader's vault saber Forge khyber light you name it I looked through all of those websites in search for Ezra's green lightsaber and I found nothing nothing nobody makes it so then I thought well if nobody makes it maybe I can order some like light saber parts like the individual pieces and kind of assemble everything together myself and the best option for that was definitely saber Forge and if all the websites I looked at they have the most variety of lightsaber parts that I found that being said I still couldn't find the pieces that I needed so I went back to google searched again for Ezra's green lightsaber and the only website that I hadn't checked up to this point was Etsy and yeah they were like one or two exact replicas of his lightsaber but these were unpainted pieces of plastic just made by people with 3d printers not good enough Etsy can be great when you're finding exactly what you're looking for but when you can oh it could be frustrating so I went back to Google did another search and this time I clicked on a video but it wasn't called the Asura's green lightsaber it was called something else the title was kind of big but by this point I was desperate I was sending probe droids out to every corner of the galaxy and following up on all of them straight up the wrong style so I watched the video and almost immediately I saw an exact ready to go ready to fight with Asura's green lightsaber but they didn't call it Ezra's lightsaber they called it something else they called it via debt and I was like the Adept what is that so then I went back to Google and did another little search on the Adept lightsaber and guess what I found saber forage samer forage I checked how could I miss Asura's lightsaber on saber forge comm oh yeah because it's called the adept who in all the galaxy is searching for something called the adept when they're actually looking for the Ezra what but then I realized that every lightsaber manufacturer and none of them called their lightsabers they really are because I don't know they hate their customers and want to confuse everybody or trademarks or whatever anyways long story short I found it Sam force comm makes the only metal exact dual ready out of the box Ezra's green lightsaber they're the only ones so I found the lightsaber someone actually makes it great but now I had to find out how long it would take to have it in my hands and that was an even bigger nightmare I went to save force come see like what their shipping times were like and they claimed it to be four to eight weeks I only had six weeks left his celebration this is basically a 50/50 shot whether or not I get it on time not good odds but you know sometimes companies like to under promise and over deliver like hey want Asura's green lightsaber just give me you know four to eight weeks even though I know I can do it in two weeks you know so I emailed their customer support asking them like hey how long is it actually gonna take you know cuz I have celebration and you know what they said nothing dates they said nothing I never received a response back to Google this time I was like what's up with saber Forge are they allergic company did they close a while ago what I found were a bunch of stories that to say the least shook my confidence in saber Forge all these stories about people waiting two months six money in months for their lightsabers ah are you is that a joke come on how can you accept money from someone and not deliver for ten months I just custom-built a car online they said it would take two weeks to arrive it's coming from the UK but I digress so I read all these terrible stories about how terrible stay reports coms customer support was and it was at that point that I decided you know what I'm not gonna order from saber Forge not even worth it and that's when I lost all hope all of the hopes that were inside of me just not even force ghosts just gone forever until a couple weeks later when I just had a super random idea Etsy for the Adept and you know what I found saber for its Syrah porridge has a second store where they sell see report sabers on Etsy say that five times fast and not only the same reports have a second store but the people running it are Jedi Masters compared to the failed Padawans of running their website so I looked into their Etsy store and I found some pretty significant differences that I would like to share with you now number one reviews saber Forge calm when you look it up on google averages what was it wouldn't it 2.5 stars on Yelp 2.1 stars on site jabber whatever that is five point two out of ten on Trustpilot did you get the picture there Etsy store five stars with over six thousand reviews number two it took three weeks for customer support to finally respond to my email to them but when I tried contacting them through Etsy it took two hours I had a commerce it like we went back and forth multiple messages were exchanged between me and their Etsy customer service all these messages an entire conversation took place in a day there on top of it Melissa if you're watching this you're on top of it thank you number three shipping speed saber force comm claims four to eight weeks the rest of the world says it's more like four weeks to ten months say before Etsy claims two to four weeks not bad number four custom my customers custom custom customizability is that who customized the ability to custom customizability I think saber Forge calm actually wins this one so my understanding is this when you order from Sabre force comm they're pretty much building your order from scratch but when you order from Etsy saber Forge can't fulfill the orders faster because they only list items on there that are like mostly assembled and almost completed this video is probably 17 minutes long at this point to summarize the entire video in a nut if you won a saber Forge lightsaber and you want it fast order from their Etsy store super quick great customer service great reviews but if you want a beautiful hand crafted specifically to you masterpiece of a lightsaber and you don't mind waiting 10 months for it to arrive any don't mind not hearing anything from customer support maybe ever then maybe give saber Forge comm a try but I needed something super quick and Etsy nailed it my lightsaber just arrived I'm super I feel like oh I feel like a kid on Christmas morning and I ordered this like not even three weeks it was 1516 days ago almost two weeks and I I just I can't wait to open it if you want to see me open this if you want to see exactly what this looks like and click up here to watch me unbox this thing and give it a proper review and wouldn't it be hilarious if I open this wouldn't you just pay a million dollars to see me open this and just the completely wrong thing are you just totally destroyed or like I don't know like a myth like a little baby miniature version of a lightsaber but like on the photo it looks legit I seriously haven't opened this yet so I suppose anything's possible go check out that video to see what happens and share this video with anyone who is thinking about ordering from saber voyage you can probably save them a lot of headaches now we'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "dSYynpTHct0": "before we begin today's video we want to give a special shout out to our new sponsor the Star Wars Jedi challenges augmented reality game if you ever wanted to be in a lightsaber duel firsthand then this game was made just for you take control of your energetic and battle against some of the biggest villains from Star Wars from kylo Ren to darth maul but that's not all as there's also a more laid-back hollow chest mode and another one that tests your wits as you command your forces be sure to get your own Jedi challenges from Lenovo a link to it will be in the description below when it came to lightsaber combat most Jedi and Sith learned the basic training methods and the traditional six fighting forms usually specializing in one or two of them after getting a good understanding of them all while the more experienced and talented duelists tended to train in the more advanced styles like form 7 others instead went on a different path of creating their own unique lightsaber fighting styles this was done for numerous reasons from developing unorthodox techniques in hopes of intimidating their opponents to honing a style that better suited their physical bodies and using their uncommon alien features to the fullest extent within a duel so which lightsaber duelists were known for having the most unique and unorthodox fighting styles first we have Darth TRAI who not only used one very unorthodox lightsaber fighting style but to her most prominent one was her ability to telekinetically wield three separate lightsabers with the force while the actual act of using the force to wield lightsabers wasn't unheard of as a few other force users throughout history have used this ability in specific situations TRAI was known for being the most skilled in the technique and being able to effectively wield the most lightsabers at once this ability was very effective against more narrow-minded fighters who have a difficult time tracking all three blades as well as less experienced opponents who may be greatly intimidated at what they witness but at the end of the day this technique wasn't as advantageous against high skilled lightsaber duelists who could easily deflect the flying lightsabers and penetrate their defenses with relative ease tre other unique lightsaber fighting style was known as ricotta this was a rare and risky dueling technique that required the user to frequently activate their lightsaber on and off mid duel as a means to bypass the opponent's defenses and to add confusion so for example if an opponent was attempting to block an incoming strike with their lightsaber the usage of true kata could bypass said defense as the attackers lightsaber would be shut off at the right moment and then turned back on to hit the opponent behind their lightsaber blade this was of course a very risky dueling technique but was able to catch even the most experienced duelists off-balance next we have curries she was a dark side adept of the Galactic Empire and was a part of the wing species known as sky tree due to her ability to fly with her wings Terri's used this flight ability and melded it into her lightsaber fighting style while being trained by Darth Vader she went on to develop a hybrid form known as trespass which essentially was a combination of the aggressive form seven with the traditional aerial dueling techniques of her people Triss best specialized on the user's flying abilities to attack their opponents from all directions pacifically the top and to focus on decapitating the opponent during the duel this form proved to be very effective especially against those who weren't great at blocking attacks or slow at adapting to fighting against opponents who were capable of flying the only other known user of this rare and unique lightsaber form was a Dark Jedi named Maul who threw his repulsor lift and Force flight ability was able to perform tris best with deadly effectiveness as he soared overhead of his opponents during battle next is Oppo rancis this whole Jedi Master was a part of a species that gave him two additional arms as well as a long powerful tail as such he used the full extent of his body while dueling against opponents which gave him a unique fighting style although he wielded only a single bladed lightsaber he used his other three hands to channel direct force attacks against his enemies his large tail allowed him to jump incredibly high and swing around all over the place as well as be used for strangling and throwing his opponents around the ground he also used his tail as a way to distract his opponents and to have them focus on it while he went for the killing blow with his lightsaber next we have I rec is Marin having a cybernetic suit installed in him that gave him eight mini bladed lightsabers scattered across his arms and knees Iraq obviously was going to have an unorthodox fighting style based solely on how his weapons were wielded by the time he had this lightsaber armor suit Iraq was effectively brain-dead and just an unhinged Beast because of this wild nature of his he would literally just run at his enemies and widely slash at them with his arms and legs hoping that one of the blades on his suit would hit them this was an extremely unorthodox fighting style and while it was somewhat effective in eliminating large groups of enemies in close quarter combat it was essentially useless against traditionally trained lightsaber duelists who could easily and quickly cut him down we then have Gork he was a mutated gomorian dark Sider who was an absolute giant for his species standing at over three meters in height due to his incredibly large size he was given a specially modified lightsaber known as a light Club which was essentially a huge version of the ancient weapon that emitted a massive blade up to three meters in length although typically those who use the light Club still fought in the traditional light saber forums Gork wasn't exactly the brightest tool in the toolbox he treated his light club more like a blunt weapon rather than an elegant sword resulting in him swinging it down as if it were a baseball bat while these strikes were incredibly powerful if they hit their target they were of course slow and clumsy tending to miss their targets also unlike most lightsaber duelists Gork wasn't able to effectively block blaster bolts with his weapon which ended up leading to his downfall as he was killed with a single blaster bolt that was shot right in front of him next we of course have General Grievous while this infamous Jedi killer was not force sensitive he was able to make that up through his advanced cybernetics which not only greatly increased his speed and reflexes but also gave him an additional two arms although formidable in dueling in the traditional lightsaber forms Grievous's deadliest strikes came from his unorthodox attacks that made full use of his cybernetics his whirling storm of four lightsabers move was among his strongest as it allowed him to do 20 strikes a second which was enough to penetrate most Jedi defenses his cybernetics also allowed him to spin his torso at 360 degrees in lightning-fast speed which he used to fend off and overwhelm multiple Jedi at once his powerful legs allowed him to make incredible jumps during fights and be able to use them to crush his opponents heads if they were unlucky enough to get caught with in their claws he also was able to wield lightsabers with his feet giving him the ability to use six lightsabers at once if he so pleased though such an act would likely be more dangerous to him than his enemies one of his more infamous moves was to lock his opponent's lightsabers using his two main weapons than to open up his other two arms and use them to penetrate the defenseless Jedi with his other two blades next we have Yoda his small size and reach forced him to fight in a manner that required him to use agility and speed as a means of both dodging and attacking his opponents from all directions the thing with Yoda was that his lightsaber skills were near-perfect in execution with every single strike and his incredible speed and agility allowed him to almost always be on the offensive as he lept around and struck at his opponent at every direction most of his opponents were barely able to fend off his attacks let alone defeat him while he was going all-out while it wasn't uncommon for similarly sized duelists to fight in a similar manner Yoda took it to a whole other level where his small size was actually an advantage in the fight not a drawback and finally we have pong Crowell this forearm Jedi Master was among the very few to effectively wield two double bladed lightsaber at once which gave him unique dueling abilities as a result although we've never seen Krell in a lightsaber duel we can assume that the effects of wielding two double bladed lightsaber x' doubled their advantages that came with such weapons which were an increased rate of attack and rapid lane movement also double bladed lightsaber known for being excellent in defense in which having two of them likely allowed Crowell to easily construct a lightsaber wall around his entire body with relative ease thanks for watching this video help support the channel by becoming a member on our patreon page and be sure to

I'm Lincoln, this is Dan and today, we're going to see what's inside a $4 light saber, which is this\none and a $400 light saber. - $400! Does this look cool? It feels really good in my hands. Let's switch on some lights. In honor of the all important day. - May the Fourth. - May the Fourth. Because of course, may\nthe force be with you. It's funny how people\ncome up with these days. - Yeah. - Like there's always a day for something. This one kind of does make sense, because like, may the force be with you, May the Fourth be with you. We went to our local retailer store and got this and it's pretty cool. It only costs $4, it does\nhave, when you push the button, some kind of light inside of it. It also has some sort of\nsound card that makes noise. We got this one online, from\na guy that builds these, actually, in his garage, seriously. - It's cool. - It is really cool. It's out of this metal that feel really strong and sturdy in your hand. - This doesn't feel\nthat good in your hand. - Whereas this one is like,\nyou're holding a sword. You're ready to cut somebody's arm off. In the Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens, they went to a really cool\nisland at the end of it and it was Rey going to see,\nwho was the guy out there? - Luke. - It's not Luke Skywalker, is that Luke? Luke's so old, that's right. I'm not that good at Star Wars stuff. At the end of it, you have that scene where Rey walks up to Luke Skywalker. It turns out, that's a\nreal place, it's not CGI. That is an island called Skellig Island, which is in Ireland. - Skellig! - For all our fans that are in the UK or Ireland or Northern Ireland, we have an event coming up, we're going to the Power of Video in\nBelfast, Northern Ireland. - I'm excited, I'm going. - At the end of May. It looks like we are\ngoing to take a helicopter and go to Skellig Island and that gives us an opportunity to mention\nour sponsors of this video. - Yes. - Because all these pictures that you're seeing right now,\nare from Graphicstock.

And now, we're going to go have a battle and then we're going\nto cut this thing open. Let's go! Aren't you going to get up and fight me? - No. It's recording. (dramatic electronic music) - I am your father. - The $4 lightsaber, loses the battle and Darth Vader wins the day. The last hit, Lincoln hit it so far, it came out of my hands\nand it bent the plastic. So $4 lightsaber, will lose the battle versus a $400 lightsaber. - What a surprise, what a surprise. This one it still completely works but there's some marks\nand scratches on it. - We're going to take this hatchet, oh, this doesn't feel right\nand we're going to cut through this really expensive lightsaber and see what's inside of it and we're also going to do the same thing to the red one. Wow, that is strong. Okay, little update, see this little tiny screw type thing, I took\nthat out right there and now watch what happens, you can just pull, and it comes out. You see that? - It's like a flashlight. - Oh, that's bright. You see that, see how bright that is? Can you see inside of it, Lincoln? - Yeah, oh, stop! - Here's what it looks\nlike, inside of that, there's just a little tiny light in there. This one is cool, I want\nto take this with us to Northern Ireland and then when we go to that island where they filmed\nthe end of the Star Wars and we go there, we can just like hand it off just like in the movie. This one I think the hatchet\nactually will do some damage on because it's just some cheap plastic. - Oh, wow. - Another just flash light,\nthat shines up in it. But this plastic is not\nthat great of a plastic. Very similar the way that these two work, they both just have a\nlight that's inside of it. This light is much\nbrighter than this red one and also, the big\ndifference is this plastic. This thing is super thick and strong. I'm going to hit this really hard and see if it breaks through, okay? Probably missed it\nbecause I closed my eyes. Take a look inside of\nthat, it has the hard outer layer of plastic\nand then on the inside, it just has multiple layers\nof the really thin plastic, almost like a little sandwich baggy. That's what it looks like inside of it. The red one, is just one\nlittle tube piece of plastic, this one has all those\nlayers to help the light be evenly distributed throughout, while this one you can see the light for first little part and\nthen it just dies off. We had a lot of fun with\nthe lightsabers today, may the force be with you. - Or May the Fourth. - That wasn't planned. Force be with you.

return here unarmed not an armed you think that lightsaber proves you were Jedi no chasing you memories that have haunted me since bracha I won't run from them anymore and let us see what manner of death your courage brings Howard if you cannot surpass me my teacher that you will die here the weapon you wield is still mine pass show what you are truly capable power the answer the loss has become a part of me I will honor your teaching and your sacrifice remember persistence reveals the path it's time for something new you and me we could build something different something better no that's a

right to our magickal justice [Music] I folded my back right here bud [Music] [Music] boarded my Tash really here oh it's like you said my Rakosi doctor near will be you're crazy let him lie in the dark with his secrets until death takes him why'd you help me sir it doesn't mirror that parasite I had a bad feeling I'd see you here oh how uncharacteristically prescient of you here I thought your greatest virtue was your dogged persistence as you stumbled from one debacle to the next Jessie made a mistake not kill me I'm bracha then ask aunt mercy I waited one meaningless Padawan against a prize that will win me the Emperor's favor do you think I'm gonna let you walk away with the holocron of course not we both have our pride but yours has cost you the lives of all the force sensitive children on that list as well as your own thank you said shrila I'm persistent I said not trained you [Music] I'm careful with that thing it's been through hell [Music] you're going I saw what you've been through you've experienced great suffering it's not too late to let it go let go I'm stronger now because of the pain I know you'd come back for this no thank you you'll never make it out of this place alive cow have the whole crop I need to do this it's over Trevor nothing is ever truly of us fight is over I know the darkness that is eating you up inside me every day we choose to either feed it or fight it it's too late that no it's not I know the choices that I made took all your choices away and I have failed utrila I failed you I am so very sorry I've carried so much hate for you that doesn't look good you have failed me Inquisitor you would be wise to surrender yeah probably [Music] we gotta run look out another turbolift let's go let's get out of here [Music] I think we lost him I'll make it seer won't fail you okay do you read me they're not responding they will I am certain of it Greece I'm here heading towards the surface be ready I have the holocron but see her she didn't make you Greece surrender the holocron I'll never give it to you Yossi [Music] [Music] I bet you take those two such hatred you would have made an excellent Inquisitor she's stronger than that no strong with the dark side yeah I can feel it inside of him yeah yeah hey listen to me still have a choice [Music] [Music]", "7xA4Nzl1-sw": "[Music] do you long for an elegant weapon from a more civilized age something less clumsy and random as you hone your sensitivity to the force you may wonder what if lightsabers were real how hot would the plasma burn how does a lightsaber know when to stop and would this weapon require a license this is what if and here's what would happen if lightsabers were real okay for the uninitiated all three of you a lightsaber is the fictional weapon of choice for the jedi the sith and other beings who are sensitive to the force in the star wars franchise back here on earth though lightsaber duels are a competitive sport using led lit rigid polycarbonate replicas of the movie props these very non-lethal weapons may emit the same glow we marveled at on the big screen but they're basically a one meter long glow stick but if lightsabers were real how much power would they use [Music] whether you're looking to conquer a universe or save one the power contained within this metal hilt would certainly help you achieve your goals according to the mythology of star wars these weapons are powered by equally mythical kyber crystals but contrary to its name this weapon isn't a laser sword so if you want to arm yourself in this reality you'd need to harness the power of plasma and by the way that's canon so don't at me plasma is an ionized gas and it's considered to be the fourth state of matter this electrical gas cloud is made up of atoms broken into electrically charged particles with both negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions but if you were to press a button and release this plasma bursts at will how could you control it well you'd need a strong magnetic field otherwise the plasma you released would extend over 100 meters killing everyone including you the magnetic fields would counteract the plasma's increasing pressure keeping the plasma confined in a long narrow shape the international thermonuclear experimental reactor is a takamak that contains the strongest magnetic walls on earth harnessing the energy of fusion it took nine suppliers seven years to create the magnets for it it also happens to be 830 cubic meters big you are going to need something a lot smaller and stronger before you go into battle and if the plasma isn't contained properly one clash between two lightsabers would end the duel by vaporizing you and your opponent magnetic reconnection is a force that involves two plasmas colliding with different magnetic fields as the plasmas come near each other the magnetic fields around them would realign and release a deadly amount of energy in the terms of a different movie think of it as crossing the streams and if that isn't bad enough if the magnetic fields were even slightly off each swing could send plasma flying everywhere but why are the magnetic fields different in each lightsaber well because you want your own color obviously whether you're wielding a purple lightsaber or a green one the colors will depend on how hot the plasma burns as the atoms within the plasma lose energy they release a light and the photons energy is also related to the wavelength of the light different wavelengths of light look like different colors to us a sinister looking lightsaber like lord vader's would have a temperature around 700 degrees but if you wanted to build a lightsaber tribute to obi-wan kenobi to get the blue color you would need a temperature of around 6 000 degrees each lightsaber would contain a unique magnetic field specific to the heat of its plasma this handheld plasma cutter would rival the strongest weapons grade technology in existence in 2012 a united states company developed the metal vapor torch which produces a flame moving over 2500 meters per second at temperatures of over 27 degrees since it's more powerful than any technology produced by the military-industrial complex legally acquiring a lightsaber would probably be a bit more complicated than applying for a gun license well at least we hope it would be after all the power within this metal hilt would be greater than a nuclear reactor so if you want to take down general grievous your lightsaber would need at least 20 megawatts of power and with that much energy you could power over 40 000 households in the uk but if you'd rather power this lightsaber without an ac cord hooked up to a bulky power source you'd need trillions of nano batteries still being developed in testing phases researchers predict that the future of our increasingly miniaturized technology lies in these powerful macroscopic batteries think of all that raw power compressed in such a small area it's a lot like neural mints from neuro the sponsor of this episode their patented cold pressed gum and mints are supplements used by academics olympians and those of us stuck at home looking to better our minds and do more and since you need jedi-like patients at this moment well try the new calm and clarity which uses ingredients scientifically shown to

your first order and carry the power to improve your mind right in your pocket because your body like this lightsaber needs a power source that's easy to carry owning a working lightsaber would definitely be a childhood fantasy come to life but ironically as the technology behind plasma containment and power cells progress were more likely to move away from this reality just as drone strikes have replaced the cavalry creating a confined beam of plasma probably wouldn't bring us an age of futuristic swashbuckling instead we'd probably use that destructive technology on a more massive scale uh speaking of which that's no moon oh geez what if we could build the death star well that's a story for another what if", "jYB5mdn_yI8": "[Music] brothers and intruder [Music] I see you said I believe keep their distance [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ctEpYE1d6-w": "[Music] here's a make raised lightsaber and just make things interesting let's say out of cardboard you're a madman okay so that looks a lot like it's the top or a staff so you could very easily cut up a toy staff and repaint it if you already have one but I don't and I don't think that my patrons would be too thrilled of me if I did that another option is to 3d print the top half of the staff and just stop but that's not useful to people without a 3d printer so I'm gonna be using these household materials tryna lower that threshold that as many people do this project as possible start with a cardboard tube and collected things that would go over thus forming the various saber modules this is called modules like this Easter Egg and these mouthwash lids also some Polly washers leftover from my very first lightsaber build eight years ago people still watch that video and think it's current nor does he care first I trace and cut holes in all the parts so they would fit snugly over the to start with the razor pen to cut those and then refine the cut with my rotary tool can a sanding drum attachment as I finished each module I slid them over the hill one by one including this slip joint poly washer it would have been more convenient for me if I had three of these so if you have your heart set on using them when you go to the hardware store in the plumbing section by three because that's the number that I would have liked to views maybe even five so I'm not sure you need them on the cones it's up to you I cut the ends off the mouthwash lids and secured them in place hot glue I used scrap craft foam for the other details and I slip those over the saber heel securing them with hot glue for the foam parts and super glue for the last plastic Polly washer just cos felt like hot glue wouldn't hold that the pipe was a little long so I trimmed it with my razor pen I add the details on the end cones using strips of thin craft foam and superglue swapping out the glues here because when you're using bits of foam that's this small the heat from the hot glue will mess it up anyway if it doesn't the physical mass of it will become a problem and look terrible so hence super glue it looks like I forgot to film it but I filled in a lot of the cracks and gaps with a quick seal when those were securely in place I cut off the excess with scissors I cut an opening for the control briefly button thing that you see it's a creepily I cut that gravely out of scrap foam this time from a foam floor mat because I needed the added depth then I refine the edges on my belt sander could he use the rotary tool but the belt Sanders faster I tried cutting the panel lines into it but that just shoot it up so guess it's time to replace that blade I ended up using a rotary disc to both cut the trenches and erase planteth steak then I painted the whole thing gloss black held this piece in place with toothpicks just so wouldn't slide around on me then I moved down to the hilt a flat black may have been a bit more accurate to what we see on screen but gloss will really make the metallic parts pop later I carefully pay the inside of the hilt just so that it wouldn't read his cardboard and close up shop while that dried I worked on the crystal chamber the basic chamber is made out of a model rocket engine housing left over from zf1 build a little yellow rocket sticking out of it and for the crystal actually making cell Kyber crystals in my Etsy store for exactly this purpose I'll link below if you like out of these designs so I just used one of my own khyber designs for the yellow crystal live it up with an LED uses a more traditional flashlight both like a mag light bulb then it'll come out looking yellower than that but it's totally up to you then I slid the crystal into the chamber and the chamber into the hilt now that the paint is dry I held the LED in place with a little dome circle off cut from my own oh maybe the dr DS yeah by the way to get the r DS of the video to be in every video it's hard to see from the reference images available to me right now as a building but it looks like the ends are very tarnished steel and the middle is corroded bronze so i'm gonna go over the edges with silver and bronze rub and buff the metallic finish which will give it a weathered look if you live in a very hot climate you might just want to dry brush it with metallic paint though because sometime rubbing buff will reactivate they got some props that where it's lasted a decade and other props where it doesn't last the shoe so think about how the prop is gonna be used while you're choosing what materials to build it out of normally I do saber blades in post because I don't like walking around inventions with an unwieldy prop but I know from experience that everybody wants to see a practical blade so give it a what I'm doing right now is making a budget practical play because I can't afford the LED blades see if you'd like to see that then you can head on over to my patreon page in the meantime these people are supporting me enough to get me this far so I thought I'd try the method that was used in the 70s which is within my budget basically I'm using highly reflective safety vest material which under a bright enough light such as movie set lights or camera flash bulbs will look like a fully ignited light see this is just a piece of balsa wood which is why I thought it was gonna break 9,000 times put a motor in there to make the blade oscillate in brightness further selling the effect oh by the way that's why everybody wears couches on their belt in star wars partially for sound equipment but also battery packs for the motors and the lightsabers here's just with the blade the spinning it back off that's how it was through that freeway so I would actually recommend this if you're just going to with convention because you know it'll look like okay you have a cloth blade in your lightsabre health but if they take a photo and you've got an angled right he it'll look like fire it's amazing you look like an absence of matter and they're staring at the Sun stay at Sodom a raised light saber out of cardboard and safety vests all right now back to the billion alien but first what's your favourite lightsabre and Star Wars let me know in comments below thanks for watching subscribe check out the past bills know how many lights ever built I have too many nonsense so such thing as too many it's starting to smell like a house fire an elegant weapon for a more civilized when we come people in the back with fire sword you are the chosen one", "a0d-wT6YS4w": "hey I'm Bob it I like to make stuff today I'm going to make a lightsaber if you know me at all you know that I'm a huge Star Wars fan and building a lightsaber of my own has always been something that I really wanted to do in fact I've been working on this project on and off for almost two years I ran into a big technical roadblock at one point I just kind of set it aside and didn't touch it for about six months that kept happening over and over in that time period a bunch of other projects have come up and I'll link some of those down in the description that are really awesome versions of a very similar set up to what I'm going to make here and of course there are also companies that sell kits that make really beautiful lightsabers and if that's all you need there's some great kits out there that you can get to have one for your costume or just as a prop but you know how I am I just like to make my own stuff so I decided to celebrate this May 4th I'm going to finish this lightsaber once and for all I've been cranking on it for several days and I got it done let me show you how I did it the idea was to 3d model and print the hilt and to do that I had to measure all of the things that we're going to go on the inside of it with some digital calipers I got all of the different measurements for all of the different components and then moved into fusion 360 to model it the entire modeling process took several hours and I'm not going to show it all here but essentially the process was this I made really simple geometric models of all the components that needed to go on the inside and then started with a basic cylinder from that I just made embellishments on the outside of it to add details and I was really just kind of making those up as I went along I am NOT a pro a 3d modeling at all I'm figuring it out as I go and if I can do it you can do it too it really just takes some practice to figure out what all the tools do and to mess with the shapes enough until you get them to look like you want them to look eventually I was pretty happy with how it turned out so I sent it to my slicing software and then to the 3d printer this was about a 24-hour print the electronics are prototypes and it's easy to see in this state so I want to walk you through it before I try to put it in the hilt that's going to make everything more compressed and just harder to understand the wiring is a little messy because it is prototypes at this point so well that would be cleaned up but there's really not a whole lot here let's walk through it I've got a strip of these RGB LEDs they're wrapped around a dowel rod and they'll be permanently attached later but this should give me a pretty even distribution of light I may have to do some tweaks there once I start building the blade that is connected to this controller this is a teensy board and there's a bunch of different numbered versions of it but this is the 3.2 if you're interested it's a very small Arduino compatible board has a lot of features it's a really cool little product it's plugging into something called a prop shield and that's in addition to the teensy that adds even more functionality this particular props you have an LED driver to drive the blades it has a motion sensor on it and an audio amp so just in that add-on we're adding basically all of the features of the lightsaber it's pretty awesome since the prop shield has an amp on board it plugs directly into the speaker to power it the speaker is a 3 watt 4 ohm speaker it's not terribly loud but fort size that puts out quite a bit of sound there's only a couple of controls on this there's two buttons one for turning the blade on and off and one for toggling through the colors and those are just plugged directly to pins on the TV this whole thing will be battery-powered eventually and I've tested that and it works but currently I've got it plugged into the wall just so I don't have to mess with the batteries and for that I'll be using four double A batteries I'll talk about those in just a second but I'm going to use this battery holder this will slide into the hilt and it's got a 9-volt battery adapter on it so it's a really simple plug that I can just plug right in this holds for double-a batteries but not just any doublea's if you buy a typical alkaline double-a battery each one puts out 1.5 volts so if you have four of them together that adds up to 6 volts this entire system only needs 5 volts and if you over volt it you run the risk of possibly damaging something instead of alkaline I'm going to use these nickel metal hydride batteries you'll see in IMH on them and basically these are just rechargeable batteries the big difference is that these only put out 1.2 volts so if you have four of these put together the total is 4.8 volts a little bit under the 5 but it's much safer and also they're rechargeable and that just makes things easier the last little piece I'm going to add in is just this on and off switch I'm going to put that in line after the batteries so it just cuts the power to the rest of the system so I can turn the blade off let's do a quick test of everything just to make sure it works before I start putting it together the first button turns a blade on it animates the light up it plays the humming sound while it's on and since there's a motion sensor in the prop shield I can trigger swing sounds anytime it's moved also all of these sounds are just simple audio files that I loaded onto the prop shield the other button just goes through a list of colors that I have preset and just switch it to a different blade color once you pick a color it stays on that color whether the blade goes up or down if you take out the battery or cut the power it's going to default back to the first color in the list every time so if you want it to always start out green or always start out red you'll just have to put that first in the list in the code I think everything works so now let's tear it apart and actually put it in the saver the blade is going to be made out of this acrylic tube it's about an eighth of an inch thick should be nice and sturdy and it's about three feet long so I'm not going to change the link the wooden dowel is going to run down the center of that tube and it has to be held directly in the middle so I've got a way to do that a 3d printed this transparent cap the outside of it was modeled to fit perfectly inside that tube and it's got a little opening on the inside that fits right onto the dowel next I made this blade mount piece the thicker part done here slides right into the handle the thinner part up top fits right into that tube and the hole on the center fits the dowel perfectly here's what it's got this is going to go on the inside of that tube and it's going to be wrapped in led's and diffusion material but first I have to cut down the dowel and paint it white after some spray paint I split the dowel through the roll of LEDs and use some CA glue to hold them on I put on one end and then spun the dowel around to tighten them and get them evenly spaced then I put some CA glue on the other end and clamped it down to dry my thought at this point was to add multiple layers of diffusion that were separated with some space in between this entire process ended up not working but essentially what I was trying to do was wrap this in freezer paper and use some spray adhesive to hold it on the gap in between this and the outer coating should have helped defuse it for the blade I cut down a piece of this vellum like material rolled it up into a couple of layers and slid it all the way down through the tube this was a little bit tougher than I expected but I got it after getting the diffusion material on the inside of this I slid in the dowel rod with the LEDs wrapped in paper and it just didn't work the LEDs were all too far apart and they were too close to the outer edge you could just see him they weren't diffused enough so instead I took them off the dowel rod and folded them right at the connection points to get each LED closer together the problem with that is that shortened the overall length of it and I didn't have enough to go up the blade and back down the other side so I looked online and found some other LEDs that will work through the same type but their closer together like these these are actually the wrong kind I ordered two strips so that I can mount them in the center of the tube without the dowel rod back-to-back that should get them far enough from the outside and give me more room to put diffusion material in there so while I wait on those to get here I'm going to go ahead and finish up the rest of it and just hope that the LEDs work like it should there was one last step to defuse the outside of the blade and that was to run over the entire thing with a sander or sanding block the pieces that I've gotten off the printer so far also needed to be sanded down and prepped for paint sending these down takes down some of the build lines and makes it easier for the filler primer to go in and even out the surface I do two coats of filler primer with a light sanding in between and you end up with a pretty smooth surface now that I have this handle finally printed out I can see that it's just too big the inside diameter of this actually can't change because it's set to fit the speaker just perfectly but I did find that these walls are just a little bit too thick that make the outside of it really big it kind of feels like a flashlight more than a lightsaber so what I'm going to do is actually go back and remodel the outside of this leaving the interiors all the same the switch will stay in the same place the buttons will stay in the same place all of the stuff that I've already made will fit on the inside but I'm probably going to change the outside of this I set myself a deadline of May 4th to get this video out and since this print took over 24 hours I'm not entirely sure that I have enough time to print the other one but I'm going to start it now and if you see this magically change shape that's why I'm going to follow the same process that I've done so far but the model will be updated and it'll be a new print since the walls on the new print were thinner it actually took a lot less time to print and I'm Way happier with the design I made sure all of the pieces fit together before starting the painting process again I sanded the entire thing covered in filler primer sanded again another coat of primer another sanding and then ended up with two coats of a metallic silver paint while that was drawing I decided to finish up the blade I had my LEDs in at this point so I cut down a piece of this foam packing material this is the stuff you would wrap around a picture frame if you were going to move I cut down a strip about twice as wide as the blade so that I could fold it over the LEDs I took my two LED strips peeled off the adhesive backing and stuck them together end-to-end these were longer than I needed and instead of cutting them ahead of time I waited till I had them stuck together and cut them at the same length I used a knife to take off some of the waterproofing material to expose the terminals on the end of both pieces then I just pushed the terminals back to back and solder them together I didn't show it here but I did plug those in to make sure that they still worked after cutting them and resolder amended the LEDs up inside the material and use some packing tape to wrap it around I can still slide these LEDs out the end if I needed to this took a while but I finally slid this down all the way to the end of the blade then use my transparent cap with a little bit of CA glue to finish it off at this point I was already thinking ahead to the next version of this so I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time on paint but I decided to take some black acrylic paint and just go over these grips that I had modeled into it the only thing left was to assemble everything I extended all of the wires and put connectors on the end of them using the heat shrink tubing so that I could just plug and unplug everything together I added some extension wires to the buttons and to the switch and fed them through the holes in the outside of the model these all popped right into place and stayed there with the friction fit that shows you how important it is to measure your items precisely when you're going to build the model with all of these buttons pushed into place there long extension wires we're now hanging at the bottom and that gave me enough room to wire everything together in its final form I wired the switch in line to the power source I added a resistor to the end of the button wires and I tried to cover up all the joints with heat shrink tubing to make sure that nothing shorted out if they got pushed together on the inside of the tight space inside the hilt with everything wired up I did one final test of everything to make sure it all worked before I tried pushing it into the hill I used some hot glue on the inside of this little shuttle I made to hold the TMT in the prop sheet the hot glue just keeps it in place make sure none of the wires are going to get pulled out I had a DES blade mount and used a little bit of CA glue to hold those together and then fed the wires through and just put everything into its place I put a little bit of glue on these joints to hold them there but it's enough that I could probably break it off with a little bit of force in case I needed to get them apart I pushed everything in and slid the cap on all right it's the moment of truth finally after all this time and unless I messed something up when I was putting it together everything should work the power switch has to be turned on and after the code starts running on the microcontroller it'll play a sound to let me know that it's ready to go okay here we go ready it alert check out the colors got red green white and the animations I've got four swing sounds in there and it just goes through them in sequences so it's not the same sound right after each other but they are pretty similar I'm not sure if the camera can really pick this up but this thing is way brighter than I expected it to be even in a fully lit room it's kind of loud so I'm going to turn it off while I talk about it I'm really happy with how it came out and of course there are a million things that I want to do differently next time and I am going to make a version 2 of this from an electronics perspective it's pretty much done nothing really needs to change there it's plenty loud it's plenty bright and it's got enough controls for what I need the only real changes to that are going to be software stuff I don't have a crash sound in so when the blade hits something I need to add that and that's purely software and most of the other changes are really going to be about the model before I even had this fully printed I was already coming up with other ideas about ways to make it better and a big part of that is adding a panel that can come off that will let me get to all the internals to make adjustments rather than having to take the cap off the end as it stands now I can get to everything and modify anything that I need to but it would be a lot easier if I had a panel that just come off another big thing that I want to do is to add a button cover over this that pivots back and forth so it looks like one solid button but it actually has a function in the top and a function in the bottom and of course I want to hide the power switch so it doesn't look so obviously like a power switch but I've never modeled any functioning buttons yet so that's going to be something I'm going to learn I am definitely going to make a version two of the handle and I'll probably end up doing that on my live stream on Twitch so if you want to come hang out with this I'll have links down in the description for that overall I'm extremely happy just to have a working version of this and to call it done even though I am super motivated to continue working on it and to make it better I'd love to know what you think about this let me know down in the comments if you have some ideas ways that I can improve on it I'd love to hear that as well I've got lots of other videos that you might be interested in so be sure to check those out and I'll put a list here of the other Star Wars projects that I've made as well don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell down there so you get notified as

palpatine lightsaber that's a mouthful but this is a 250 dollar lightsaber this is part of the new forcefx elite series with detachable blades it's fancy special effects uh let's take a look at the box here it makes it look like it's going to color shift from red to purple very similar to the darth revan lightsaber if you haven't already seen that video i'll drop a link at the end that one i had a lot of problems with it's still bad uh does not work very well um yeah like it's like it's loose and like it just shuts off all the time when you're trying to use it uh hopefully this one works a little bit better what i'll also do is i'm gonna unbox this thing i'm gonna try and compare the two blades in them see and if you can flip-flop them out if the actual uh blade section is compatible between the two so we'll kind of contrast these two a little bit since they're both red purple lightsabers they should be pretty similar but uh very cool uh we're gonna take a look at this thing and everything that comes with it it's really cool to have the senate uh the lightsaber of the senate right uh vampire palpatine uh also if you're not aware there's a 25 amazon gift card going on right now all you have to do if you want to win that is be a subscriber leave a comment on this or one of my videos let's go ahead and get this thing out of the box all right so at the top of it we have our lightsaber actual uh actual blade piece that is detachable we have our little connectors right in there uh and here is the whole blade it looks looks uh at first glance it looks a lot like the the saber we already have with uh with the uh our other one from revan um here is our part of our stand we're gonna have a couple of extra pieces for it right here so i'm gonna set those there we'll set that aside we've got the hilt here uh we also have the top section uh which is kind of cool um now this one i don't think it comes with the kyber crystal insert that the other one came with which was kind of like a way you could put a kyber crystal in there and like have it um kind of uh still give you a light effect with no blade in this one doesn't have that but this is a really fancy looking saver and i know i'm gonna get fingerprints all over it but let's go ahead and open it up wow this is the shiniest the very very prettiest wow it's very pretty um and look at this man why do they have two tops i guess i guess one for when it's off and then one for when it's on huh let's take a look at the other top i'm gonna set this down right there i'm trying to be real careful with it because it's so pretty i definitely don't want to get it scratched up um okay so this is i guess the top for when the blade is in and this is probably the top for when the blade is not in so we have two separate tops if you want it displayed uh it's gonna look like that wow wait um this is so smooth too there's hardly any buttons yeah i guess you do have your you have a button here and you have a button there and so yeah this is really nice and i know i'm gonna be getting fingerprints we've got some tape right here with our little logo i'm gonna take that off right now i don't want i don't want this piece of tape on there you know so i'm going to take this tape off well i'll get it off later i'll get it off more cleanly this is super cool let's try and get this lightsaber assembled and uh go from there so here it is without the top screwed on and i'm trying to figure out how to get the batteries in i had to uh check out the documentation we actually have an allen wrench that comes with it in the packaging there we're gonna unscrew this and then slide out this battery compartment here all right so i've got my batteries we're going to put those in there and get this back on and try and fire it up all right so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and insert our blade lining up the thicker peg with the thinner one and then we got a twist there we go and then we can go ahead and take our cap here and pop it back on but first before i pop the cap back on just wanna make sure it works all right it seems like it's working all right well let's put this on now i did notice one interesting thing about this there we go spun that on um so now we have it basically complete we have the blade in there which is super cool um i did kind of compare it to the revan uh blade and an interesting thing about this is this does fit inside the revan sabre however the revan sabres blade is both longer and thicker than this one so it actually this one won't fit in here so it's not uh both ways compatible so while you can put this one in the revan one you can't put the revan one in this one so i just thought that that was interesting and worth noting and we're going to keep the other piece here i also have the uh the the stand assembled so we can put it in there when we're done and i guess we can keep the other piece like right in there so you don't lose it but let's go ahead and do like a more of a full demo of this particular saber all right so we're gonna fire this thing up now i have the lights up high so it may not look as good because the red lightsabers usually don't look quite so good under white light so i will run through a quick demo then i'll turn the lights down a little bit darker so we can take another look so here we go um fires up pretty good i think you probably want to grip it a little bit lower because you could easily your hands could slide up and turn it off like if you're just while you're doing this oh and by the way yes if you hold the green button this is the coolest the coolest thing right here is holding the green button kind of does the force lightning you know that is very cool it doesn't stay purple um so that much as well now the red button here if we tap the red button so it does like blaster bolt deflection so tapping the red button will do the special effects holding the red button is like you're cutting through something or you're engaged with somebody in a in a clash so holding the red button does the rainbow effect you can see here at the tip if i was gonna if i was cutting into someone or trying to cut through a door or something like that um and it's kind of like white and yellow then orange than red so you actually have a pretty good spectrum of different colors available on this particular saber which is pretty cool so we can it's basically out of the two buttons you have four different things now a big difference between this these two sabers and i'm gonna i'm gonna compare them directly because because we've also got red and green buttons and very similar functionality with the revan saber is uh and the revenue saber you can hold both of them to change the purple and in this one let me turn that on and this one i don't believe you can do that let's see if i hold both of them it does not do that i want to point out though but before i did this when i had this blade and the other one this blade is capable of turning to purple this is not a functionality of the hilt because when i had this blade held in the in the revan saber and i had to manually hold it and they're kind of loose because it's not made for that saber uh when the blade was in there and i held both buttons it did turn this blade to purple so this particular blade is capable of of doing that color i mean as evidenced by the fact that if i hold this it's showing purple plus a couple of other colors like purple and white so it can definitely do it um but overall it's like it seems like it's it's pretty good um it does sound like it has the exact same sound crystal though this exact same sound card that all the other red sabers have it's very normal sound which for a 250 dollar saver it's kind of a bummer here and i'll tap though you know so it like kind of kind of normal sound which is a little disappointing now i'm going to turn down the lights and we'll try and kind of get a better gauge for the the quality of the color because it's pretty bright and it looks pretty good all right here we go i've got the lights turned down and much brighter you can really see that glow um not every room normally is going to be as bright as i tend to have it here while i'm filming so you can get a much better appreciation of of the clash right when you're clashing with somebody does that with that white that white effect and again it's very easy to to accidentally turn the power off when you're doing it because the button is just so sleek like it's a very sleek design um we'll try a couple of these you can get that cutting through effect i'm gonna try and cut into darth vader's helmet here um and uh and let's try the force lightning effect ready that's pretty cool actually that looks really cool right and it looks much cooler in the dark than it looks with it really brightly lit up so i think this is a super cool effect and uh just for comparisons effect also with the revan this is revan's purple compared to that i think this has the better effect i like this one better than robin's although reverend's has the reverend's obviously has the comparison where it it can change when you hold both buttons and turn into a red one and you're comparing the two reds together so that is that is that um honestly really cool saber i am totally digging it and let's check it out on the uh on the stand all right so here is the stand we can now take this thing and we can put it in here one of two ways we can have it with its kind of not blade attachment side on there or we can have uh it with the blade attached and have it on there uh we have a little divot down here which is going to go in the bottom ring and then it's just going to rest nice and comfortably right there and here's a kind of a side view of it uh it's pretty good leans back a little bit it's a very heavy uh stand it's pretty bulky um i mean it's still a little top heavy if you have the blade in there so you don't want to like move it around very much but this will uh stand up nicely next to other sabers uh however there's not very many that have this type of stand this is something that's new for the force fx elite line so the dooku saber has this for example this one has it i believe the ahsoka sabers that are going to be coming out have that for example whereas the original black series line does not the regular force fx they just have like the sideways where they're going uh lengthwise you know you probably saw when i was demonstrating this you probably saw the dooku and asajj ventress sabers uh on the on the shelf behind me i've got a whole bunch of other lightsabers by the way if you're interested in seeing more of them i'm going to have some videos over here on the at the end you can check out uh be sure to click that subscribe button too to see more content more star wars content more gaming content star wars and games that's what i cover a lot of tabletop games as well as video games as well star like star wars squadrons and a lot of other collectibles so i do all of that here i'm gonna go ahead and set this up without the blade and just see how it looks on the stand from that perspective as well all right so i put the other cap on right now this is the bladed cap and this is the closed so it's almost like it opens and closes but really what's happening is the light would be shining through and you wouldn't be able to see all that detail so i appreciate the fact that they put two caps on there um however it's still you know it's still an extra step to put the blade in and put the blade out but that's okay uh also i want to point out one additional smaller feature is that uh if you push this button with no blade in you are gonna get a like a failed deactivated uh sound and that's basically yeah you know you can even cosplay with this and you can just be like oh my power cell is low or something like that uh which is which is always fun um so again it's gonna be the same procedure as before you're gonna set that in there it's actually gonna be a lot more sturdy it's gonna actually look a lot prettier here and depending on your shelf space this may be the preferred display option to have it just like this uh although if you are gonna display it once you're done handling it definitely like polish it up wipe it off with a rag or so i've got fingerprints all over this thing it's gonna be almost impossible not to get fingerprints on this thing because it's all chromed out it's beautiful and uh you know and i was grabbing it and then my wedding ring um i already has brushed against it a little bit so if you plan on ever wielding it uh maybe don't wear jewelry don't wear wet rings i've already got a scratch on mine but personally for me i don't mind that because i have a lot of black series lightsabers and i play with them me and my kids play with them supervised of course but i'm not i don't just display them i also fire them up i keep the batteries charged in them this halloween this past halloween we couldn't go trick-or-treating there was no none of that going on in our neighborhood so what we did is when is when the lights went out uh when it got dark we went in the front yard and we had a big ol we just pulled out all the lightsabers and we were all dueling um now these blades are not meant for serious dueling you can do very light sparring with them and fine but if you're actually cracking them hard at each other they are going to break you don't want to do that but you can definitely do some like cosplay and light sparring and having fun but don't swing it hard because they're not designed to be fighting savers but you can you know you can whack them light enough to at least make the sound without much risk of injury but this is a really cool saber i really like this one it's heavy it feels good it's got beautiful detail uh and i love the effects i love the lightning effect even though palpatine doesn't exactly shoot lightning through his saber you can hold out your hand right next to it and it kind of simulates that so it's a really good cosplay effect uh the i love the effects i love the look of the saber i love the weight i love the stand uh i i love just about everything about it my only complaint really is that uh the allen wrench to uh do the batteries can be a pain in the butt and uh you know that's not much of a complaint and i guess maybe maybe it's kind of maybe a missed opportunity that these blades aren't interchangeable that i can't you know that i can't perfectly swap the blades for you know the the the other uh force effects elite lightsabers because i feel like that's like a missed opportunity there if they were all interchangeable then you'd have a lot more flexibility i wouldn't maybe i wouldn't need to keep them all out maybe i could just have one ready and then when i wanted to go i could do it because if i don't want to store it now i'm going to have to go through some trial and error when i'm trying to reassemble that if i want to collect a lot of forcefx elite lightsabers i might have to put little sticky notes on like this one goes to palpatine's saber might not work with other ones you know and so i feel like that could be a problem in the long run so i would love to see them have fully interchangeable ones very similar to how disney kind of does that where all of the blades are interchangeable and they actually and then they could sell alternate blades like maybe you want a shorter blade or a longer blade or something like that or maybe a brighter blade or replacement blades in case somebody does duel with them and breaks it or maybe even sparring blades so that may be heavy dutier but not as bright like that would be my suggestion for a future uh hasbro uh lightsaber products and maybe they'll come out with a a customizable line or a or a fighting saber line would that have you know universal blades that are more designed to be hot swapped and replaced but uh for now uh all those things aside this is a really good saver not sure if it's exactly going to be worth 250 because that's a pretty steep price tag compared to you know some of the uh lifesavers with less features but if you are a fan of beautiful lightsabers if you are a fan of the prequels if you're a fan of palpatine and the senate i am the senate if you are not afraid to make it legal you may want to check this thing out it is really really nice and while it's uh certainly expensive you're definitely this is probably the the nicest lightsaber that i have uh seen yet that i think that hasbro has put out so that is definitely saying something so uh hopefully you like this review if you did go ahead and give it a thumbs up let me

the rest of us have a great day you", "ZPu1DDHRTcY": "Hey everyone, when I made my How to Turn\nPlastic into Brushed Steel tutorial I asked if any of you wanted to see how I\nmade my son's Luke Skywalker lightsaber. Well lots of you said yes, so here it is.\nAlright so the first thing I did is I grabbed a golf club tube. These are tubes\nthat golfers keep in their golf bags for reasons I'm not entirely sure of but you\ncan pick them up for pretty cheap. Then I cut out a super-sweet template which\nwill be available at the end of this video. I wrapped it around my golf club\ntube, taped it in place and then traced the top and bottom edges.\nI removed the template and then cut the tube to shape with a pair of cutters and\na sharp knife. I made sure everything was trimmed\nperfectly to the lines. I un-tubed my template and marked the width of piece\nnumber two on a new piece of tubing using the end of the template to give me\na straight line. I cut straight up the tube just past the line and then cut\nalong the line. I cut some aluminum tape and carefully slid it into the curved\nfront end of the lightsaber. I had to make sure that it didn't touch the\ninside of the tube until it was in the right place, otherwise I would have a\ncrumpled tape mess. Once positioned I could stick it down and rub it smooth\nwith my fingernail. I used my scalpel to trim off the extra, carefully not cutting\noff my fingers, and repeated the process on the other half of the inside. A\nquick sand and it's time to tape up the outside. One strip of aluminum tape, one\ngolf club tube, some sticking and some rubbing and some more rubbing...actually a\nlot of rubbing. And eventually I had that piece down nice and smooth. I trimmed the\nedge, folded it over and rubbed some more. I super carefully lined up the edge of\nmy second piece of tape with the edge of my first piece of tape and did the same\nthing all over again for the bottom side. Apparently this was\nmy lucky day because the spot where the second piece ended was exactly where the\nfirst piece began. I also covered the short little piece with the slit up the\ncenter. I used a green scouring pad to give the\naluminum a brushed metal look. I grabbed my sweet template again which showed me\nthe placement for piece number two and I glued it down with some hot glue, keeping\nthe gap facing to the right hand side. I cut two pieces of foam board the size of\npiece number three, stacked them up and glued them together. I then sanded them\non the edges to make everything nice and equal and of course covered them with\naluminum tape,  just like wrapping a tiny little Christmas present with sticky\nmetal paper. I glued my little present right over the gap on piece number two. I\nthen grabbed my jar of random metal things and dumped it out. Happily there\nwas a drywall anchor in there, one of those with the spring-loaded metal wing\nthings. I used some pliers to open it up, grabbed one of the wingy things and\nglued it on to the side of the little box. I cut some strips of five millimeter\nfoam according to the dimensions in the pattern and glued them equally spaced\naround the bottom of the lightsaber. I cut 10 centimeters of half-inch PEX\npipe leftover from my mechanical arm project and three randomly sized pieces\nof 3/4 inch PEX. I covered all four of these pieces with aluminum tape, made\nthem look like brushed steel, and glued them together to make this thing. I added\na couple strips of foam around the back two segments so that when I pushed it\ninto the main lightsaber body it fit snugly and stayed in place. I happened to\nhave some copper tape laying around from when my mom was into stained glass so I\nused a couple strips of that on top of the boxy thing. I traced and cut piece\nnumber four from my pink plastic tray, heated it very carefully over a candle,\nand bent it into this shape. I sanded off any weird spots and covered it with tape.\nI marked its placement and glued it on. I found a thing in my jar of metal bits\nand glued it on too. I then made a foam circle to close the\nback end of the tube. I cut piece number four from my pink tray, heated it up and\nbent it in half. I bent an old coat hanger into a triangle shape and glued\nit inside the pink piece. I glued the pink piece to the back of the lightsaber\nand painted it silver. Well there it is, quick and dirty lightsaber build.\nDefinitely not screen accurate but I was able to make it in about four hours\nwith stuff I had lying around the house so that is pretty good. Also you know\nwhat I might not recommend hot glue for everything because it isn't the best for\nsticking to this metal but it's quick and I needed quick today so use at your\nown risk. You can grab the template from the link here or in the description\nbelow or you can let me know what project you'd like to see me do next in\nthe comments. I haven't decided what I'm gonna do after I finish my wife's winter\nWonder Woman costume so now's the time to tell me what you'd like to see. Thanks\nfor watching. See ya", "teHu8Njm5HE": "Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.\nAn elegant weapon for a more civilized age. Well what do you have to say about that\nvideo games? Wort wort wort. Hello internet, welcome to game theory\nwhere to answer all your questions one more time the red in the logo is not a\nreference to the Xbox red ring of death. Why would I do that? As some sort of\nweekly warning against the hubris of game console manufacturers? As a loving\nreminder of all those times you had to cuddle your xbox 360 under a blanket in\na last-ditch effort to get it to function? Nope it's just a reference to\nmy other channel film theory which has red in that part of the logo. Oh it makes so much sense now. And lately on film theory I, like the\nrest of the internet, have been covering a lot of star wars which means my mind\nhas been swimming in Jedi battles and galactic terrorism as of late. Which leads\nus to today's episode because as I was researching the physics of the\nlightsaber, I couldn't help but think about another\niconic weapon, one we all know and love from gaming, the Halo energy sword, and\nonce I really started thinking about it I couldn't shake how similar these two\nweapons actually are. I mean seriously these aren't just two\niconic laser sword weapons they're more like brothers from different mothers but\nas it is with all twin brothers now that they've finally been reunited we're\ngonna have to decide right here and right now which one would win in a fight. Right? that's a thing that siblings do? I'm\nan only child so I don't really know. I'm assuming that's a thing though and\nbefore we get too far I want to make it absolutely clear that this theory is\nexclusively focused on the weapons alone not the characters who wield them. Were\nwe to open the door to that well then we'd have to talk about\nmidi-chlorians and no one wants to talk about midi-chlorians. Not even star wars\napparently, so in order to start comparing the weapons and decide which\none would win in a fight we need to understand how they would potentially\nwork in the real world. When it comes to the energy sword, Halo has already done\nmost of the work for us. According to the Halo encyclopedia, the\nblades of the weapon are made of plasma contained around the edge of the sword\nby magnetic fields. Now we've talked about plasma before on Film Theory since its the closest real-world basis for all of Dragon Balls energy attacks, but just to\ncatch everyone plasma is the most abundant form of matter making up ninety nine percent of the\nuniverse but what is it? You know how when you heat up a solid it melts and becomes a liquid and then you heat it up a bit more and it\nbecomes a gas. Well if you heat the gas even more it becomes plasma. We're most\nfamiliar with it in the form of lightning, stars and fluorescent bulbs\nbut basically by heating the gas the electrons in the atoms get so excited\nthat they break away. This creates a soup of negatively\ncharged electrons floating around alongside positively charged ions. The\nHalo energy sword then at its most basic level takes this soup and controls it\nusing magnets, shaping the superheated gas around the blades of the weapon but\nwhat's an energy sword without energy? Well it's actually just a sword. Yeah. And that's why batteries are\nincluded. Haha, puberty. And that's why batteries are\nincluded in each new weapon, suck on that Mattel, the future is now. Changing a gas to a\nplasma takes a lot of energy so the battery enables this to happen by shooting\nan electric current through the gas allowing it to change its state\nin much the same way that a plasma cutter works and thus you have your\nbattery operated death sword. A pretty cool thing to look forward to in the future\nright? Not really, plasma blades are something\nbeing rolled out in medicine for things like surgery as we speak so this idea isn't so much science\nfiction as it is just plain old science. Explaining the lightsaber though is\nactually a bit trickier since, well, it's neither light nor saber. Let's\ntake it one at a time, light is made up of particles known as photons, they're constantly flying all over the\nuniverse they have no mass and generally don't react with one another. That's why you can cross flashlight\nbeams with no difference in the light that's being produced. Sure I suppose you could shoot light\nthrough a cloud of super cold rubidium gas which gets the photons to act more\nlike molecules creating a new state of matter called photonic molecules but\nit's a fringe case that's still being tested by science and seriously who do\nwe think we are? German experimental physicist Gustav Ludwig Hertz come on,\nwe're not. The other problem with lightsabers made\nof light is that currently science has a hard time telling photons when to stop\nmoving. So if a lightsaber were truly made of light and without a mirror or something\nat the end of the sword to stop the beam, it would extend a much longer distance\nthan a few feet. I guess in that case you wouldn't have\nto compare sizes though. And I see your sword is as big as mine. And again, just like high-powered\nflashlights or lasers, a lightsaber of light would'nt actually clash with another\nlightsaber they would just pass through each other and you would shine it in\neach other's eyes hoping to cause like night blindness. Pew, pew pew. Shine it in your eyes! Oh its so bright! Ow ow ow! So anyway, it's not a lightsaber nor is it a laser saber, then what is it? Well more likely than not\nit's a plasma saber but again not a saber either since a saber is a calvary\nsword with a curved blade and one cutting edge. Curve, nope. Only one cutting edge? I dare you to\ntouch that thing so more like a short sword. No that's not\nright. Plasma woo swoo sword. Plasma epp\u00e9?\nPlasma rapier? Plasma katana. You know there's really no sword like\nequivalent to a lightsaber honestly it's more like plasma\nbludgeoning stick. But why plasma well currently the same\nsystem operating the energy sword makes the most sense for the lightsaber. A\nmagnetic field shaping a super heated tube of gas. Midi-chlorians or no the behavior lines\nup, in Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace qui-gon jinn uses his lightsaber\nto melt through a blast door, meaning the lightsaber is getting above 2500 degrees\nFahrenheit or thirteen seventy degrees Celsius now look at the temperature of plasma.\nEven quote unquote cold plasma is several thousand degrees celsius so it\nwould have no problem accomplishing this task. What about different colors of lightsaber? Well the different colors of gas used to form the plasma could create the\nrainbow of colours you see in lightsabers, helium for Mace Windu to produce\nhis purple color, argon for Darth Maul and his dark red sabre and CF4 Luke\nSkywalker's heroic blue and because plasma is an actual state of matter unlike a blade of light here the Sabres\nwould clash. Just like you see throughout the iconic\nsword battles in the movies and games. This idea is also supported by\ntheoretical physicist and all-around scientific badass Dr. Michio Kaku and if you needed any\nfurther proof although the movies don't ever mention\nplasma the games do. To quote Star Wars: The Old Republic the weapon consists of\na blade of pure plasma energy emitted from the metal hilt and suspended in\na force contained field. Boom! Decades of cannon for this\nclassic film series and yet it's the games where we get the most information\nabout how these iconic weapons would work. Video games for the win, long story short\nwhen you actually look at the science the lightsaber and energy sword are one\nin the same so if they're basically the same device\nwhich one would win? Well as similar as the tech behind them\nis these blades could'nt be designed anymore differently unless your name is either kylo Ren or\nDarth Maul the lightsaber blade tends to be a relatively thin and modest rod of\nvariable length while the energy sword is actually two triangular blades with an\nopening that runs down into the center towards the quote unquote hilts. So which design comes out on top? Because\nlightsabers have a more basic and variable design it opens up a lot of\ndifferent fighting styles and since the blade is plasma all the weight is in the\nhilt. According to the now legendary article\ncalled fightsaber from issue 62 of the Star Wars insider and the jedi academy\ntraining manual we know that there are seven main styles of lightsaber combat.\nEach style has its own emphasis on specific tactics or defensive techniques but one commonality across nearly all of them is an emphasis on amputation moves\nstrokes that will sever limbs, most notable of these is the cho mai strike\nwhich single-handedly resulted in so many single hands in the Star Wars\nuniverse. Badum ching. Even the Wampa, come on! The Wampa!\nPoor thing. For the energy sword it's a bit more complicated because there's so much less information on the way elites actually use it to fight but we can put\ntogether a good guess based on history and its design. Firstly let's look at the gap between\nthe two sides of the blade, the gap always narrows almost to the point of\ntouching just before you get to the area where your hand is, as if the opponent's blade is meant to slide right into that slot and that's exactly right. This split structure allows the fighter\nto trap their opponents blade so the elite can twist it either disarming the\nenemy or leaving them open for the killing blow. It's an idea that's been proven\nthroughout history, most notably by the parrying daggers from the late Middle\nAges and early Renaissance. For instance take a look at this 16th\ncentury German trident dagger who's blade springs\nopen in to 3 precisely because trapping the opponent's blade is such a good idea. Like a Schick razor commercial, why have one\nblade when you can have seven? No one suspects the trident dagger or look at\nthe sword breakers which had small teeth like a cone near the hilt where an\nopponent's sword would slide in and get stuck. So it's an offensive weapon that also\nhas defensive properties but the other benefit of the energy sword is that both\nsides of the blades extend almost completely around the wielders hand. Even extending down beyond the wrist into sharpened points, in a battle with a\nstraight lightsaber used mostly for disarming or should I say dis\nhanding the opponent this design detail is a huge benefit to the energy sword. It\nalmost makes it seem like the energy sword was designed specifically as a\ncounter to the cho mai strikes of the lightsaber. So when it comes strictly to design the win has to go to Halo. So then that's it right? It would look\nlike the Halo energy sword is the winner based on its design. Well there's one big issue we haven't\nexplored yet. Better check your CNET review score on that new plasma\nsword my friends because just like most other portable electronics in the end it\ncomes down to the battery life. You heard that right! Break out the\ncharging stations for your beam swords these things need some energy sources. Deep in the extended universe floor it's\nrevealed that during the ancient history of Star Wars, lightsabers had to be\npowered through an extension cord that was connected to a bulky battery pack\nworn on the Jedi's belt. These would go on to be known as protosabers and man, can you think about how lame battles in the movies would be if they\nwere still using these guys? I mean just cut the cord or force grab the battery\npack and all your opponent is left with is a handle. Eventually the design\nevolved into what we know today with the power source moving into the hilt and\nnow you've got fights like duel of the fates from Phantom Menace where Jedi are\nfighting for what seems like several hours at a time but even still Padawans\nwanted that protosaber. According to the jedi academy training manual a member of luke skywalker's Jedi\nOrder actually went on to revive the protosaber. That's right it's the definition of the\nJedi hipster. Oh, ah the retro way was so much better let's bring this thing back even though\nit's clearly inferior to what we currently have. This could potentially\neven show up in the new movies this character was an order of Luke's\nJedi Order after all wouldn't that be just, just so weird I\nhope he also wears like, flannel robes and thick rimmed glasses that don't actually\nhave a prescription in them maybe some tight Jedi leggings leggings. Jeggings. Anyway that said even the most poultry\nbattery life of a lightsaber would trounce that of the energy sword which\nlasts as all you Halo fans know ten whopping swings before your left\nweaponless holding the equivalent of a weird alien shake weight. So that makes\nit case closed then right? Despite design superiority the lackluster energy\nsupply of the ironically named energy sword losses to even the most low-tech\nof protosabers. But hold on to your rat's tail Qui-Gon\nbecause after doing the research ten swings may be more than enough time\nfor our elite to finish off a saber wielding Rey. Remember our ground rule at\nthe beginning, that in this contest no consideration will be given to any force powers we're talking strictly design and\nfunction of the blade and though a ten swing battery might sound like it sucks,\nin the real world without force powers or respawning when two people fight each\nother with swords the fight only ever lasts a minute or two and most of that\ntime isn't spent swinging swords around frantically it's been poking each other\nat a distance. Just think about fencing, you guys\nclearly watch those right? I mean they're pretty awesome so you should\nespecially during the Olympics they're incredible. Anyway let me tell you, in fencing\nmatches rarely if ever are you getting to 10 swings. Contact is made within one or two jabs\nusually, in fact most experts out there today believe that most actual sword\nfights never even get to the point where someone would try to do a two-handed\nswing because of how completly dangerous it is to do. It leaves\nyou wide open. Instead fights, if they did happen had\none or two clashes of Steel at most before someone was on the ground\nbleeding out and in this situation under these rules\nin the argument of light sabres vs energy sword it's actually Halo that\ncomes out on top. Yes the battery life might suck but\ndesign superiority wins the day, although let me be clear I love them\nboth. Don't pull a death battle and rain down a lot of hate on me this is really\njust meant to be a thought experiment where I could teach you about plasma,\nlight energy and sword design. Not saying that one is like, cooler than the other or\nwhatever I'm saying in the battle between two fictional swords that are\nbasically the same but designed slightly differently this one functions slightly better than\nthis other one. Ok I'm still gonna get a lot of hate for\nthis episode aren't I? But hey that's just a theory a game theory! Thanks for watching.

untubing but uh these are two lightsabers that i ordered from txq sabres which is one of the competitors for lgt and i got this from aliexpress so um if you guys check out aliexpress there's lots of lightsaber companies that sell similar things and i found these ones and they had a pretty good deal so i wanted to try them out and maybe compare them to the lgt's but before i unbox these i do want to let you guys know that i'm having a lightsaber giveaway coming up really soon at 500 subscribers uh we're growing every single day so i look forward to this next giveaway and the ones after but i'm gonna go ahead and bust it open it seemed pretty straightforward just at the end of these tubes there's a plastic cap and so i'm just going to try cutting the tape around the cap and uh so yeah like i said they had pretty good deals and the sound boards seem the same from um both lgt and txq so i was really curious about what you're getting i was i was doing a little bit of research and apparently these guys used to all work for the same company and um i guess they had like a fallen out or everyone went their different directions and made their own saber companies so uh yeah just kind of curious to see what the difference would be since they're kind of all drawn out the same design but right off the bat it's a little sports grip to wrap around the saber so that's neat and uh so go ahead and pull it out and i don't know the names of these sabers actually i don't even know if they have names for their sabers but there's another one of the sport wraps and as you can see it looks like an instruction a recharge cable extra screws and an allen key [Applause] so yeah oh yeah and uh so this side tells you just the details about it and this side tells you how to activate it so that'll be helpful later and then we bust out the other one same deal all right and yep that's everything in the tube all right let's see all right there's unboxing number one and i got them both the same and there's a second one so yeah oh one thing i will notice is the blade looks really thin that actually might be a 7 8 inch blade so that's pretty neat never had a thin blade like that but yeah um i don't know if you're supposed to turn them on right away i don't want to mess them up let me see no it doesn't save any warning so i'll go ahead and turn it on that's a cool startup noise all right and i'll use the instructions um all right it seems kind of like the lgt [Music] [Applause] one it has a good reaction that's a very interesting sound font okay cool i like how it changes colors it's just instant changes versus the other ones it just kind of cycles through so that's kind of neat um sound effects so when it's off it says you just hold it for two seconds [Applause] all right okay so not too bad especially for um i mean what i paid for them and the cool thing about these ones is you can actually take off the pommel and screw it together and he got you a double-bladed lightsaber and i'm sure if you got a couple timing shims you can make it line up even better than that because as you can see it doesn't line up too well but yeah i mean pretty cool especially for like i said where i paid for them it was a pretty good deal you guys should check out txq on aliexpress if you're looking for a good budget saver i mean for everything that you get oh there's my cat wants to be the star and uh yeah i mean for everything that you get that's pretty cool i'm actually kind of interested in going around and spinning this around looks pretty fun so uh yeah i hope you guys enjoyed the unboxing again i just want to let you guys know i have a lightsaber giveaway coming up i'm going to have a lot more star wars come content coming up really soon i'm really excited about showing you guys what i have um planned uh that's gonna do it for this video and i will see you guys in the next one", "IDWRGJNLyt0": "it's over anakin i have the high ground you underestimate my power sup gamers we have gone completely insane at this point we have added lightsabers to among us actual working lightsabers there's really not much else to say other than we were using proximity chat and i've never laughed so hard in my life in a long time the only thing that you need to know is that each imposter gets a lightsaber that matches their current color crewmates won't see the

mommy juice killed meme god because muffin thought meme god was the imposter can someone let me join the dark side i want to join the dark side what do we have here oh green and green footprints oh wait laughs body oh well well well well i saw green footprints all around another green's body yeah wait life you killed dino yeah he tried pulling the lightsaber on me but i was sharing oh you heard him here first american revolver beats lightsaber hey blossom joe yo you wanna you wanna join the dark side the dark side the dark side where's that brazil [Music] no like the dark side of the force oh yeah sure yeah see that would you also want to join the dark side we will become yeah well i i'm a detective i see green footprints coming straight from the vest what is this i can explain i'm calling a beating i can't even hear [Applause] [Music] [Music] let [Music] that's what happens when you join the light side all right wait are you ready for your first lesson to become a jedi i mean yeah what is it all right is it to fix the lights no don't fix the lights you have to be bored of the dark molded by it yeah oh okay i was teaching that way the dark side right and the lights go dark and i was like don't fix the lights you gotta train to be in the dark so you could join the dark side right and then i hear the lightsaber whooshing no i didn't kill him that wasn't me that wasn't me see if the force can let you breathe in space i will never join the dark side let's see about that i'm saying oh me and the banana man you got to be kidding me how are you doing here get away your scary sids plays huh i'm just doing my talent show that sucks talent you're showing him his lightsaber you shoot it hey that's illegal that's some freaky stuff so as an imposter i have a lightsaber you want to see my talent your talent where you're going to kill me the security i swear if these if these doors close if these doors are closed okay jedi i am powers do i have um you're the accent i

also have the teleport ability which is kind of interesting dino would you like to join the dark side would you like to be able to shoot lightning from your tips i mean now you know you say it like that maybe baby right the dark side is cool is it all right uh it turns out the lightsaber doesn't have a kill cooldown you want to go to security with me security security do we do go yes let's go to security everyone can watch no everyone stay outside this is no that was a visual glitch that was a visual glitch [Music] that was a shame i am the mayor no i'm not i'm the detective and muffin you
