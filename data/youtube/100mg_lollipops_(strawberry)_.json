{"ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for

[Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby

his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man

consumption advice on the back we're gonna ignore all of that comes with some nutrition facts as well but you're always handy to serving size 120 calories so there are 240 calories in this 16 fluid ounce bottle so this dozer has 100 milligrams of THC serve shake well serve ice-cold just came out of the fridge looking forward to it first time trying to drink on wheats so let's see both how it tastes and how it makes us feel and like with all our wheats mini-reviews what we do is we take the entire product down it and then I come back to you guys in two hours I'll let you know how we're feeling so not further ado let's open this bad boy up shake well again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you so much for watching guys and we'll catch you on the next video", "pvply1CNh9Q": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I know what you're thinking if you're a fan of my videos but wheats you're saying you've already reviewed the strawberry lemon-aid and that is correct but I've only reviewed the 200 milligram variety I have not yet reviewed the 100 milligram bretty in fact I've never reviewed any of the 100 milligrams from cannabis quenchers and the strawberry eliminated was my favorite flavors so far so I thought I'd give it a go if you've ever tuned in two weeks before guys the way our show works is I'm gonna take this edible or drinkable consume a bowl here finish it and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling cuz that's the most important part of any edible review but without further ado let's open this up and give it a smell give it a taste see how it tastes and smells it's got a strong we do der just like the other cannabis quenchers but that's okay because the the taste isn't that bad if it's like the others I assume it should taste even better having less THC in it but let's find out [Music] and yes that is the case he's just like the other one except with a slightly less power potent wheat aftertaste which is great because the that's the worst part about this is the sort of lingering marijuana taste in your mouth is sort of oily weedy taste the initial taste is great it's just that aftertaste can linger a little bit but this is less potent than the 200 milligram variety in terms of that aftertaste so that's something look boy - it's good the gondolier said Strawberry Fields and cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever again don't know what the gondolier has to do with cannabis winter at all can't figure it out but I'm glad he's there to tell me all right guys well I am going to finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats chasm we'll see you soon peace guys half the price half the THC but not half the potency man I gotta say pleasantly surprised with the cannabis quenched your 100 milligrams I am pleasantly stoned for something that it's only advertised as half the strength as it's a hundred milligram brother and I don't feel half as high I feel you know not as high but but certainly not significantly less and the price is uh it so this is all this is I think it might dispensary half the price of the other one I think I would go with this one unless you really really really want to get knocked off your ass or if you have an incredibly high tolerance stick with the two hundred milligrams but I gotta say the hundred milligrams gonna do you the job probably and it's gonna do it at a more affordable price and I really really have enjoyed my reviews with abbis quite sure I will probably try some of their more exotic flavors just as an excuse to keep drinking them Wow yeah a plus um this gets uh well say an a because the the flavor isn't perfect and that's the first time I've ever given anything a letter grade before and probably the last time I ever do that so enjoy that and thank you cannabis quencher this was a great beverage and thank you guys for watching we'll check you on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys

tests a low test I don't know but it looks like corn on the cob almost but you can kind of make out the word strawberry flavored so interesting look to it for being strawberry flavored and look at that let's get this open so take a look at that now those of you out there that like this kind of Canyon had before then you know leave some comments there help me out be nice I'm gonna try it for the first time and then I have a rag here off to the side I'll wipe off my spittle who wants to see someone spin all right now I didn't fight it yet but there is this coating of that flavoring I don't get any kind of strawberry flavoring so maybe I've got to dig deeper I don't know so I guess I have to bite this hold on okay now inside I don't can't see it strawberry for some reason it's got a little bite to it you do get that sugar any kind of strawberry taste but it's not like you're eating a strawberry you know what I mean I don't know about this one it's good but you probably got to spend more

chocolate eggs each toilet has to Molly Papa back ain't oily the sugar aha tells me the eyes okay so this is the green guys gonna build it Oh", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "xKHP-1wefq8": "- Hi, Andrea Meharg here\nfrom revealcannabis.com, where I teach you how you can use cannabis to live a healthier, happier life. And today's video is all about how to make cannabis infused beverages. This is really exciting for us Canadians who don't have cannabis infused\nbeverages on the market yet. They will be coming in October of 2019, but for right now, I'm gonna teach you how to make your own. Basically, what I'm\ngonna show you how to do is to make a simple cannabis tincture that you then add to the\nbeverage of your choice. I'm gonna walk you really quick how to make an alcohol tincture because I already have a longer\nmore detailed video on that that I'll link below. And at the end of this video I will provide you with a recipe book that can hopefully stir\nup your creative juices for what you could make with your cannabis infused tinctures. So let's get started. I'm gonna show you what you'll need to make the tincture first. Okay, first thing that you have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. So, basically this is\nheating your cannabis up so that you are getting THC or CBD instead of what's naturally\nfound in the plant, which is THCA or CBDA. The easy way to do this at home is to put your cannabis into a mason jar and put it into a preheated oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. The reason you put it in the mason jar is it helps to keep down the smell. However, if you have one of\nthese beautiful little machines, you just put your cannabis in and press the button and away you go, when it's done it shows a different color. Again the advantage of this is that you get more of the\nTHC or CBD from the flower. After you're done, you are\ngoing to grind your cannabis just slightly to increase\nthe surface area, you're not trying to turn it into powder. So you just zap it a couple of\ntimes in your coffee grinder. If you don't have a coffee\ngrinder for cannabis, that's okay use scissors or\nyour regular cannabis grinder. So I'll show you that it looks like that, right now the nugs and I'm gonna go zap it off camera so you don't have to listen to it. So, put your ground up\ncannabis into a mason jar, same mason jar you used to decarb it, if you used the oven which is fantastic. I'm all about less dishes. So it looks like that when it\nis just a little bit ground. And then you're gonna\nadd in 1/2 cup of Alcool, or Everclear or whatever you're using. So I'm using seven grams of cannabis and one 1/2 cup of Alcool. You can increase the\npotency of your tincture or decrease it by using\nless flower or more flower, less alcohol or more alcohol. So I'm gonna shake this up, and then all you do is you\nput this into a crock pot that has water that covers\nthe amount of your tincture, and you're gonna put this\nin your crock pot on low for about eight hours\nand then you'll be done. So, thanks to the magic of television. I already have a cannabis\ntincture ready to go. So when you're done, you simply dump it into a\ncheesecloth lined strainer. The other thing I've seen people do is use a reusable nut milk bag, so those are bags that people use to make almond milk or cashew\nmilk and they're reusable. So you put it into your little satchel, your cheesecloth satchel and then actually like get right in there and really squeeze this. You do not wanna lose any of your beautiful\ntincture to the garbage. I know people do lots of stuff with the satchel of cannabis leftover when it's infused into butter or oil. You can make it into high chai or you can just dump that\nright into some baked goods. But when it's done with\nalcohol, it tastes terrible and I haven't seen any\ngood uses for it yet. So if you see a good\nuse for this at the end, please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, just squeeze\nuntil you feel like you've got it all out. You're gonna store this\nbeautiful mixture in one of these to keep it away from the sun, and then I'm gonna show you how to make some infused\nbeverages, let's go. Before we go any further, I wanted to point out three things. First, make sure that\nyou open your mason jar that's sitting in the warm water about every 1/2 hour to an hour while it is infusing in there to let go of some of the pressure, that's called burping your mason jar. Second, if you are trying\nto get a CBD tincture, then just make sure that you\nstart out with cannabis flower that's really high in CBD. This is a great recipe to have on hand because you can really\ncustomize the ingredients and get the exact type of\ntincture that you'd like. In fact, some people even\ninfuse other herbs and flowers into these tinctures. Let's think about some\nof the delicious drinks that you can make now that you know how to make a cannabis tincture. So this is really where your\nimagination gets to run wild. Basically any drink that you drink can now be infused with cannabis. You just take a couple\nof drops of your tincture or a dropper full of your\ntincture, and away you go. So lots of people love to make lemonade or just put some into their coffee or tea. People infuse or have cannabis\ninfused Pop, Coke or Pepsi, whatever it is, you can really\ndo whatever you want with it. The only thing to point out is to avoid mixing cannabis with alcohol. Let's talk about dosing. How do we know how much we're getting in a dropper full of\nthat cannabis tincture? There is a way to get a\nreally good approximation, it's not gonna be totally perfect, but this is a good way to\nget a good approximation. First thing is that you're gonna find out how much THC or CBD is in your flower. If you're buying lab tested cannabis, then you can just look at the label and it will tell you how much\nof those components are in it. If you don't have it with a label, and you do know the strain name, you can head over to\nleafly.com and type it in and they'll give you an approximation of how much you THC it might have in it. And if you don't have any idea what it is then you can take a guesstimate. Average THC concentrations\nright now seem to be around 15 to 20%, so take a guesstimate. And once you know how much\nTHC or CBD is in your flower, then you can go to this\nhandy-dandy dosing calculator. So it's at the wakeandbake.co website which I highly recommend if\nyou haven't checked it out, and all you do is fill out\nthis happy little chart here. So the Tangerine Dream that I infused had 15% THC and 1% CBD, and I use seven grams of it and I infused it into 1/2 cup of alcohol. So I know that in my whole infusion, there's 1,050 milligrams of THC, and in each teaspoon,\nthere's about 43 grams. So let's go back here and\nsee what we can do with that. I just wanna say though, even though you're using\na dosage calculator, that does not absolve you of the responsibility of\nstarting low and going slow because every time you make\na new cannabis infusion, it can be slightly different, so don't depend on the dosage calculator to give you the exact precise dose, make sure that you try it first and see how this particular\nbatch fits with you. So, most recommendations are to start with five milligrams of\nTHC or less per dose. So let's talk about my\ntincture that I just made. We know that it has 43\nmilligrams of THC per teaspoon, and each teaspoon has five milliliters. In tincture bottles, the droppers are standardized to one milliliter. So there's five droppers\nin one teaspoon of THC or in one teaspoon of tincture. So 43 divided by five is about 8.5 milligrams per each dropper. So in my tincture for each dropper fall, it's about 8.5 milligrams of THC. If I was trying to get\na five milligram dose, I would have slightly\nover half of the dropper and that would be my dose. It's really easy to adjust\nthe potency of your tinctures. If you wanted a more potent tincture, you would add more cannabis\nto the same amount of alcohol. So maybe you'd add 14 grams\nof cannabis instead of seven. If you wanted to less potent tincture, you would just add less cannabis to the same amount of\nalcohol and away you go, you can really customize it. I'm gonna give you a recipe for a delicious strawberry-mint spritzer, that you just put a couple of drops of cannabis tincture into\nand then it's infused and you can have a great afternoon. So what you do is you\ntake a cup of strawberries and a 1/2 cup of fresh mint and a couple of tablespoons of sweetener, whatever you're gonna use\nand mix it up in a saucepan so that it really begins to\nbreak down and come together and the mint releases its oil, it's gonna smell super beautiful. So do that, it takes about 10 minutes and then let it cool down and put it into a\nblender or food processor and pulse it until it's smooth. Grab a glass and fill it\nup with some spritzers or soda water and then put\nin a couple of tablespoons of your beautiful\nstrawberry mint concoction that you just made and however much of your\ncannabis tincture that you want and stir it up and you\nhave a beautiful infused, delicious cocktail.

known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one

Mike today toughest strawberry lollipops what we need first of all we need a line awakened at or a whisper non-stick baking paper and set aside then we need fresh strawberries washed and a dry entire then we need some skirts you can purchase small skirts but if you don't have small stores use just a normal average skirt and a slightly cut on a smaller shirt a little bit sighs so what you have some with those take as many as you will awake lollipops then we need 1 cup of castor sugar it's about 220 gram and 1/4 cup of water so what we do is we take small saucepan and combined a castor sugar with our water then what we do is we place and over low heat for 5 minutes or until sugar is dissolve mixing with a spoon once sugar is his odor then bring to the boil over medium-high heat and cook without storyand for five minutes or until light golden then remove from heat once toffee mixture is done as you can see it's light golden color so what we do with obscure sir it on top the strawberry and dip into tofu mixture took to completely cold and then place on a prepared baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and just let it go once again slow couple times and just elated dribble excess of toffee you once stupid lollipops are cooled down as a ready to stew and it's really cool type of front to flip strawberry Oh lollipops everything will be in the description books please do have a look a few interesting thank you very much return with me today I hope you love this very simple creation of toffee strawberry lollipops thank you very much for your time until next time goodbye", "xt9TmUHvmV8": "[Music] welcome everybody back to a new vlog guys um as i promised the last time to make a vlog about this kind of beast lollipop has everybody been asking so yeah it is um you know a lot of people have been asking me can you get high of a cannabis lollipop right hmm how about a little more i don't know so that's what we're about to find out today guys let's see if we can get high of cannabis lollipop but before i try i want to do some research on the internet and as you guys can see right here what it says about the cannabis lollipop and actually i bought this in the street sorry in amsterdam and what i found out here on the website it says that anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop here in the netherlands doesn't contain any thc so i don't think uh lollipop i cannot this lollipop can get you high to be honest guys but we about to find out today it's about to go down let's go guys first of all as you can see i act this is how it leaked with the amsterdam written on it and you have the lead logo on it let me open it and try this so we can [Music] see if you can really get high of cannabis lollipop or not but as we already know the answer guys you can get half cannabis lollipop though i'm gonna go ahead and try it anyway to show you guys so if anybody ever show you or you can hear how the cam is really about that that's [ __ ] actually as it says and let me open this it's just a little bit hot to open guys [Music] [Laughter] are you serious [Music] do a few moments later finally guys [Music] that's a whole lot of work to open the lollipop it wasn't i noticed so i opened it it was very sticky it's very sticky um [Music] actually it smells like weed to be honest okay [Music] oh hold on a minute guys [Music] i don't like the taste to be honest guys like i don't like the taste but for some people it might taste good it tastes like sweet actually and i haven't noticed any effect on i get how to feed anything like that just to say that's easy i want to do the research now anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop doesn't contain any thc and if you don't have thc in your canopies you can get high like so if anybody ever tells you how this that's [ __ ] because you can't get high off it cannot be lollipop it doesn't contain chc so it's just like our regular candy so if you have a key definitely don't recommend you to buy this for a kid guys because uh cannabis is drugs it's legal in some countries some countries not so i can't recommend any mother or family person to buy this for their kid no if you ever see this as i just ignore it but just so you know you can't get out of this i don't give that to my kids to be honest i won't give this to my kids but i'm just saying like it tastes pretty much okay but bruh oh if you make my thongs green right [Music] actually it doesn't taste that bad to be honest but for me i don't like these just like locris they you know so how do i recommend you guys to buy these yeah if you're 18 upwards i recommend easier to buy this you can actually find it in most of the shops in the upstate area most of the shops around upside you can find this here so you don't need to go to a coffee shop to buy a cannabis lollipop guys wait a minute you can buy a almost every shop here in amsterdam oh that says on the reset that i did you can only buy anything that contains thc in the cannabis shop so don't let anybody try to play you anybody trying to fool you or make you feel like oh i just take two of these or i just get half a cannabis lollipop because that's [Music] not me so here you have it guys you can get out of this [ __ ] so [Music] and the coffee shop is about to close in 10 minutes time so you know what's up guys my [ __ ] i gotta go born today see you next time guys and don't forget to subscribe like share my vlog have a nice day guys", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "PzFIVVg8_y0": "hey you guys and welcome to my channel today i'm going to be making some heart suckers so first thing we're going to do is we are going to take some of these wilton candy melts and their strawberry flavor and we are going to melt those in 30 second increments until they are completely melted [Applause] so here we go i'm going to pop those into the microwave and i'll be right back when they're melted okay guys i am back and it is melted smooth and we are gonna just put this into a piping bag and then we are going to pipe them into this heart sucker mold so i'm just going to pour that into there set that to the side i'm just using some wilton ties i'm just tying it and then i'm going to clip off the bottom i'm going to pipe a little bit into each mold then i'm going to stick my lollipop sticks [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] i'm gonna tap those down okay and there we go i'm gonna place those into the refrigerator for about 15 to 20 minutes and then we will pop those out so i'll be right back i popped a couple out um real fast just to see if they were ready um but they basically just kind of come out pop right out like that so they're really cute too and i left them in there for about 20 minutes i put them in my freezer not my refrigerator so [Applause] i don't know if y'all can see them but let me just move this around i did find some packaging and this is just it is for like um those pretzel rod sticks or whatever you want to call it it won't fit the bigger one i've already wrapped one um it'll just do the middle size and probably the little ones but they're pretty long so i have to and i just found some red twine it's a little long so we're going to cut it and then i'm just going to cut where the lollipop stick ends and there we go it's it's really cute i really think it's adorable so anyways and you can also put these like on a cake or you know just whatever i just think they're really cute thank you so much for watching if you like this video please let me know by hitting that thumbs up button and if you're new here and you want to see more of these videos please

you made last year we did a bunch of recipe testing and settle down two ways to make chocolate covered strawberries that I know you're going to let I'm Megan I'm passionate about finding ways to make life of kids easier in the kitchen so let's go through our ingredients for both ways you'll need some fairly large strawberries chocolate chips and then an oil of your choice and I'm using refined coconut oil for the strawberry lollipops you also need some straws ribbons and then sprinkles are optional the first step is to wash your strawberries and try them really well you want them completely dry or the chocolate won't stick to them and the next step is to melt your chocolate so have some chocolate chips in a large bowl and then I have a little bit of refined coconut oil again you can use whatever oil you have on hand I'm going to put that right in there and do my melting in the microwave microwave your chocolate chips on high for 30 seconds at a time during well each time so they don't burn I recommend using a silicone spatula so the chocolate chips don't stick my chocolate is all melted it usually takes my microwave about a minute to a minute and thirty to do that and now I'm going to prep my strawberries by hollowing them so I've got a really small knife and I'm just going to go right around the center now I'm going to pop my straw into my strawberry I have these adorable striped ones and pink and light pink that I'm going to use for Valentine's Day and it should just pop right in there and then I can dip I'm just going to swirl my strawberries down a few times to get all the drips off next you need to let the chocolate harden you can't do that a last paper but I find the strawberries tend to get a little bit flush which I don't love so instead I bar it a little bit of this crafting styrofoam from ruff I'm gonna stab the straws right in there next I'm going to show you one more that I decorate with some sprinkles so again right into my chocolate you're just going to dip twirl and then add some sprinkles now all this wants to do is add a little bit of ribbon for some extra embellishment so I'm just going to tie it around and make a little bow these came out so cute and they're a great alternative to cake pops I love I can leave them undecorated or add some sprinkles or even some sanding sugar next up we have our s'mores strawberry again you'll need some clean dry strawberries and your melted chocolate you'll also need marshmallow and crushed graham crackers and the first step for this version is to melt your marshmallows in the microwave with yes you can do you just need an extra large bowl because they actually kind of puff up the marshmallows are melted and very sticky and the first step is to create a marshmallow layer on your strawberry so I'm going to dip it in and roll it around you'll notice I didn't hold my strawberries and that's to give me something to hold on to while I dip them in the marshmallow place them stem side down so they don't stick to the last paper my marshmallow is hardened and you can tell because it doesn't stick to your finger when you touch it and next our s'mores needs the chocolate layer so I'm going to pick it up and dip it right into the chocolate dip your strawberry and chocolate leaving a little marshmallow to show and then sprinkle with some graham crackers my kids love the way these more strawberries taste and I love how the three layers look so there you have it a couple of twists on a traditional chocolate covered strawberry I hope you guys have a wonderful Valentine's Day thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time bye guys is it good yes yes I'm gonna cakepop really looks pretty good is really good you got some juicy lips can I get them [Music] you", "00ArNfhqkLg": "hey what's that boy girls welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at one of my favorite things out there and that is edible chocolate love the chocolate bars and we're taking a look at a huge brand today one of only reviewed one of their products foreign have found it to be not so good so we'll be interested to see if their chocolate does any better and that is flavor ex-flame rx Flav prescription I'm just gonna go flavor X I don't want to say it they're 100 milligram toffee bar Oh made by Kanak oh I had not seen that there that's exciting that hopefully makes me optimistic I didn't know this was made by Kanak oh the flavor X bars I have only tried their fruit bars before exiting back there they're they're gummy snacks and did not really enjoy them but chocolate is usually a much better vector for THC and this is a pretty huge brand I see them everywhere everywhere this is the new regulations size 10 milligram pieces 100 milligram total although it says it actually has not yet been a lab tested there again you can see Hanako so we are gonna be optimistic and hope that it is as good as the other Kanaka products and better than the Flav Rx products I've already reviewed so here we are here is our flavor X bar inside its packaging oh and this cost me 20 bucks at my Long Beach dispensary so I'm out in line with the 100 milligram edible now which is a bit unfortunate it let's dig it out and there we go pretty simple ten pieces very small pieces of chocolate I guess they're only ten milligrams and again it is toffee flavored so let's give it a try well there's some good quality chocolate mmm no cannabis tasters because I don't really taste anything but hmm good rich milk chocolate top you provide is a nice little crunch the flavor front could not be more happy with it but guys as you all know it's not about how it tastes I mean you wanted to taste good but what you really wanted to do is to get you high and for that guys like all our reviews I'm gonna finish off this flavor X bar over the next couple of minutes here and then once I finish it I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling is that's the most important part of any animal review so wish me luck I know I've got my fingers crossed I hope this one's gonna be a winner and I'll see you guys in just a bit I'm back and has actually been more than two hours since I checked in with you with the flavor rx bar I got a little ahead of myself in my activities but I am happy to tell you this is a good product um I did not like flavor X cartridges and I did not like their candy but I quite like this chocolate bar I tasted really really good on the upper end of the chocolate it's not the best of the best I've had but really pretty damn good and it's quite potent for a hundred milligram edible this really did the trick for me um I'm hoping or suspecting that the made by Cana Co is why that this one did the trick so this Flav rx chocolate bar is actually gonna get a big thumbs up from me it's not a plus tier like your Kiva or your de francais but it is close it is tasty it's pretty affordable in this new world um and uh it'll get you high so flavor X toffee 100 milligram bar that's gonna be a thumbs up for me give it a chance if you see it at your dispensary think you'll be happy you did and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on our next row deuces", "n0dedUqabyQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ID_y1ArCBmU": "I'll start things off with grape lollipops it's a perfect introduction to candy making so the first thing I need to do is prepare my lollipop mold you don't need to buy a fancy mold to make lollipops you can actually create your own what I have is a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm going to sift 2 to 3 cups of icing sugar on to the tray have a nice thick layer of icing sugar the amount you need really just depends on the size of your tray basically you want about half an inch layer of icing sugar just grab a spatula when you're spreading out your icing sugar do it loosely don't pack it down and the bigger the tray you use well the more lollipops you can fit on now that I have an even and pretty level layer I can create my lollipop shapes what you want to do is take a flat bottom glass in any shape you want and press it into the icing sugar packing it right down and take a little peak to make sure that you have clearance of about a quarter inch maybe just a little less all the way around this is where you're going to pour in your hot sugar to shape your lollipop you can find lollipop sticks at some grocery stores but definitely at stores that sell baking supplies and I press it into the icing sugar so that one end of the stick goes right into the mold there we go now I'm all set what I love about making lollipops at home is the fact that you can control the flavor and the color and you can go all natural using clear fruit juices is a great way to add flavor and color so I'm making grape lollipops by using grape juice I'm measuring out half a cup of grape juice now on its own this grape juice is too thin it won't add in a flavor or color so what I need to do is reduce it I'll put it in a small sauce pot turn up the heat on high and I want to reduce this down to about 2 tablespoons by volume this will only take a few minutes and you could use any juice you want so long as it's a clear juice that way your lollipops are nice and clear there we go my juice is reduced to now a syrup two tablespoons worth because the water has evaporated away so you're left with that concentrated flavor color and sweetness so now we're all set to start the actual lollipops first I put a quarter cup of water in the bottom of my pot that way it makes it easier for the one cup of sugar I add to immediately start dissolving you want to liquefy that sugar pretty quickly and then typical to a lot of candy making corn syrup white corn syrup is a common ingredient that really gets the clarity and the set to your candy making so I'm adding a quarter cup I'll set my heat to high which is how you cook all of your sugar when your candy making and that sugar boils and it boils beyond 212 Fahrenheit you want to cook it all the way to 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's called hard crack in the candy making world and it's before it turns to caramel but yet it sets up so that your lollipops have a nice crunch using a thermometer is important in candy making that's how you know you've hit your temperatures precisely but as the sugar starts melting and coming to a boil and throughout the process I occasionally take a brush dipped in cool water and just brush the sides of the pot this ensures that any sugar that might boil up and hit the side of the pot doesn't then cool down and crystallize give this a little check I'm at 235 the goal is 300 I can tell I'm getting close because the bubbling of the sugar is starting to slow because the sugar itself is thickening up there we go once your sugar hits the 300 degrees take it off the heat and then you want to add that concentrated grape syrup and give it a quick stir in immediately it adds that gorgeous purple color and I can smell the grape now you take your ladle and pour in to each mold make sure you're covering that lollipop stick if you find your sugar is starting to set up on you you can always put it back on the stove on low heat to remelt the sugar and this is where you can get creative with your decorations you could add sprinkles a few draws a is like I'm adding finished with a few more small ways once you're finished with your lollipops you want to give them 15 to 20 minutes to set up then it's time to take them out of the icing sugar they will have icing sugar on them from the mold so first I take a little brush to brush them off and take a lightly moistened cloth or paper towel and just wipe off the icing sugar and then I dry it off and there you can actually see right through it once they're cleaned up and have had a chance to air dry a little bit then you can pack them up in little sello bags for gifting or just store them in an airtight container until you need them I bet you never guessed that making lollipops was actually so easy an all-natural to love that nice grape flavor it just looks so sweet", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "d2znw-FjhME": "[Music] hello this is Jamie and I am with edibles led and I'm Patrick I am also with edibles list today we're making lemonade not just any lemonade but in used lemonade using as Rossum cars called magical th see startups power this is one of the easiest ways to infuse drinks because its water soluble is just malko dextran it's involved in any warm pre-prepared already made our own simple syrup yes simple syrup just sugar stardust powder and hot one alright and then tell us about start us yes every packet is 15 milligrams of THC and it is gluten-free and vegan is the multi dextran powder it's one of the easiest ways that you can infuse pretty much anything with THC it goes great in coffee tea or soup but you can also mix it with a little hot water and then once it dissolves you can add it to anything you can pour it over a salad with a dressing you can infuse an oil and vinegar dressing with it put it in oatmeal put it on your

give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and

bunnies welcome back welcome back to my valentine's day theme week where every single day this week from monday to friday i am uploading a valentine's day themed recipe so today we are making some chocolate strawberry lollipops so let's get started so first to make the lollipops you want to set a pot over medium heat and add some sugar water and light corn syrup and i'll have all the ingredients and quantities listed in the description box down below in case you want to make it then stir with a rubber spatula until everything is melted and combined increase the heat to medium-high attach a candy thermometer to the pot and heat until the sugar reaches 310 degrees fahrenheit remove the pot from the heat and stir until it stops bubbling add the flavoring and mix until fully combined and so i'm using strawberry flavoring and i'll link it down below this is my favorite brand of flavoring it's really really good then add as much food coloring as you like i'm using the wilton color right the pink shade and i use about six drops to get it this bright and i'll link the food coloring down below as well then use a ladle to pour the candy into a lollipop mold so if you're using a silicone mold like i am you can pour the candy directly in but if you're using a hard plastic mold a lot of them are clear and they say like for lollipops and whatever um you want to spray it with cooking spray first otherwise it will not leave the mold it will get stuck and it will be awful i've been there you don't want to be there [Music] then stick lollipop sticks into the candy and rotate them several times to make sure that they're fully covered in the candy and this is going to help them stick inside the lollipops like when you're eating them then leave the lollipops at room temperature for two to three hours until they have fully cooled and hardened then to decorate dip each lollipop part away into some strawberry dark chocolate so it doesn't have to be this kind of chocolate this is just my favorite and it tastes like strawberry so i feel like it's perfect for these lollipops then place them on a slip hot mat or a sheet of parchment paper and let them harden just at room temperature for about half an hour then melt some white chocolate and put it into a piping bag and snip a small hole at the tip drizzle the chocolate on top of the chocolate dipped portion and how cute is this i love this so much pour the remaining white chocolate back into the bowl and mix it with some matcha green tea powder and this is going to dye the chocolate green then put the chocolate into a star or asterix shaped mold that's just what i had excuse the doggies in the background and then place the mold in the fridge and chill for 30 minutes then just unmold and use some extra green chocolate as a glue to stick them onto the lollipops and you are done so thank you so much for watching i hope that you like this recipe make sure to subscribe if you don't want to miss out on the rest of the week's videos tomorrow is a doggy recipe and it's so cute and you'll get to see my doggies so make sure you stay tuned i love you guys so much and yes i'll see you tomorrow bye", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any questions for me please comment I don't really know how to oh alright it has showing life but I don't have I only

welcome back to another video this week we're gonna discuss lolli popping this is an adults-only video so if you are 18 years or older awesome if you're not deuces alright thanks for coming by guys let's get into it I want to show you how I lollipop my plants everybody got beautiful white widow flowers over here some cornucopia action look at that oh yeah we are in one week of flower it's definitely look and I get everybody definitely definitely look like it so excited here's the canopy guys looking good looking good so a point of this video is lolli popping guys so the reason why I do it is to increase the airflow underneath the canopy of the plants also to get rid of any growth that you don't need the plant produces all the energy from the soil to grow with the lights we add the co2 because it's what they use to metabolize all their foods in the soil and in your nutrients and all that good stuff so the point of this is to only establish a certain amount of growth to use all that energy if you have a ton of energy underneath your canopy you guys that's black and darkness it's not gonna do very good for Europe plants you want to make sure that you're maintaining them and giving them a good haircut you know every few weeks that's kind of what I do sometimes I wait a little longer sometimes I don't usually just depending on the health of all the plants so before here we go as a before picture or video I guess you could say of the plants on this side before my lollipop II you can see all this growth on the bottom I mean this is perfect timing if your cloner man you can I could probably get a hunter this all today what I've already pulled out but look at all this growth in the bottom guys like see the darkness sitting by the darkness like you don't really need any of this growth down here this is just not it's not gonna be sufficient to put the energy in the plan you know to do all that you're not gonna grow much you're not gonna you're not gonna produce many you know cola tops as you want then the plants going to establish all that energy across different branches and then you have small branches a weiner is like this look at this guy down here like I'm cutting that off that's definitely coming down the darkness guys look at all the darkness you don't that's energy wasted right there 100% 100% energy waste and all that darkness and all those plants right here all this all these like all that everything basically from the net below is what I trimmed down so we can just maximize the airflow in the garden so here's a good good view of before I'm just gonna swing over to the other side real quick to get an after swing on over to this side real quick all right so here's the other side guys you can kind of see even on the top side right here I can see down below into the you know under the floor a little bit which is often that means the lights penetrating that down there also which is very good that just means we're just great light coverage that's all that means I got to 315 Sun system le sees I have my enhancer going finally all you gotta do is get up there cover that little hole so you don't get stuff on you Google shake and you can hear the happiness that's just gonna boost my plants up and heal them up quicker than later alright guys so here is the after band everything has been chopped down you can see all the trimming and everything that I cut off everything dig a little stressed out of course cuz it's trimming out a lot of your plan I mean you're getting rid of 30 40 percent of your plant probably not 40 but more like 30 and that's just man that's just a lot have a good cornucopia here guys I mean good plant training I've been doing that's how you just maximize your yields look up all those coal is just shooting up that wouldn't happen if you just didn't train your plants look at this one you can see a really solid topping really solid nodes right here pretty sweet that's a nice topping there's another topping right in here how you train your plants down in here you got the topping right here and then now you have two main stalks but I've had two main stalks you have like you know two four five six seven eight nine ten main tops coming up creating a sexy canopy of just you know beautiful stacking to like you know all this is just gonna be stacking up to be just snugs and colas baseball bats you can trim some of these leaves off because they're not useful but there is my after you guys all these plants are doing good let's get a rundown of the plants here we got a cornucopia in the back going on a corner we got the brisker Pakistan Valley or chill out OG from mr. grow it right here we got the strawberry diesel looking awesome white widow that is I've got to trim the hell that one but she is just killing it little tiny strawberry juice along a little 2 gallon pot right here just blowing up nice good tops on that one wouldn't be surprised if I don't get some good stuff got another cornucopia from brother Mendel selections just looking beautiful another Brit skier Pakistan belly or chill out og see how I topped it and just stress train the heck out of it super beautiful and then here is a Skywalker og just killing the game right now got all this beautiful structure coming up just to create big colas and nuggets everywhere if you guys see wizard mpk man that guy does some really good steak techniques I want to get on to that steak techniques and in the backyard guys we have our other brisker chill out Ozzy chill out og from mr. grill and that one needs to be trimmed like a moat row true alright guys I just wanted to show you how I lollipop my plants make sure things are looking beautiful in green all the time just like this get you guys a couple of beautiful flower shots before we exit here I just want you guys to you know stay awesome thanks for coming by please sub and share this video I just want to have fun I have barely any editing at all

have no problem telling you guys how I get things done you guys all stay medicated stay gifted stay lifted row on dab one smoke one for me guys you guys are all incredible people don't conform to society be yourselves have a great day", "-_hhZdGhF2Y": "okay today we are going to make cannabis lollipops first things you will need are tempered candy molds to absorb the heat of 350 degree molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "uOH22FHrzjQ": "let's take a look at these lollipops these are Japanese lollipops from plane Hello Kitty themed really cute packaging cloud the colors each of these costs around sixty rupees or around a dollar or so for sale in Japan only these are made in Japan only text is in Japanese looks like this has a twenty two pennies and officially licensed by Sandra oh I'm guessing that's what the lollipop looks too let's taste it these are strawberry flavored so that's taste it it's a really nice strawberry flavor very tasty looks quite cute

lopez lollipops with chili um some of my subscribers have been talking about the a little kid it was mouthing wolf Steve that was talking about this was a pineapple flavor looking at you Steve that said something about that pineapple this is strawberry on it chili pepper powdered powder covered acidulated lollipop strawberry artificially flavored it's made by Dolce's bureau like I said on the other on the bureau mango I'd look confused about that it's in a meet Costa neat package because it isn't I mean it doesn't say anything about it on here about me close tanita so I don't know why they're putting it in this package that says quality candies like they're responsible for I just don't know I haven't looked into it you know research there or anything about why it's in these packages it says that can distribute it by Yoli incorporated okay so this is well I guess it's supposed to be shaped like a strawberry I guess Oh sugar corn syrup chili pepper chili pepper powder some salt see I think that's pretty much about yeah mentions grupo Bimbo which is responsible for a lot of different candies made in Mexico okay see this what do you think does that look like a strawberry yes if it's strawberry flavored you would assume it would be a strawberry shape hey I mean it's not shaped like a strawberry it's actually shaped like I think Steve was mentioning that it's shaped like a corn crop but I think he said that he looked this was a corn cob a cooker some kind of a corn cob cooked with something on it shoot a camera what he said but yeah you can see the texture there that it looks more like a corn cob there see so it's a strawberry strawberry flavored corn cob smell you can smell the chili powder really good it's not really covered thick on this one mm-hmm mm-hmm like I was saying on the bureau mango back in the 90s when I first discovered their bureau mangos I yeah are those type of Mexican candies I will if you're a man goes I would get big packages of 50 of them for decent price when we was working in Texas for this restoration company my brother and I went over into Mexico right across the border there was a little store mm-hmm and we went in there and I found a big bunch of them for a really good price brought them home like that why not go to work I will just rush on rush off and just and we have a our staff was probably 75 80 percent Hispanic guys working for us know that working with this and that I had my own office now it's the warehouse manager so I would put out a big can full of different candies that I would sell them to the guys and I made a little bit of profit but only so that I can afford to buy more candy I think I charged how was it I think I charged a 25 cent apiece for these this package is a dollar for a forum it's a pretty good price getting through to the sweet stuff now the bureau mango that I did the other day I don't remember this happening before but when I was done eating that sucker I looked got my Tanya it was totally red and then that evening it was still red I brushed my teeth and my toothbrush was red just like there's a lot of lot more food coloring in it or something that it used to be I change it up over the years I guess okay so you can kind of see the yellowish color there they're kind of confusing because you think that it being strawberry flavored maybe well but it kind of looks like pineapple kinda has a pineapple color or orange come on the planet buys a little bit off though so I'm just to get the flavor not getting strawberry hmm there we go a bit he doesn't say anything on here about strawberry I didn't say anything on here about a flavor at all just says corn syrup sugar corn syrup chili pepper powder not official flavors no that's pineapple I don't know why they'd lie to me to get it it's good though okay well I'm get it there she goes with my big Meech colada oh yeah it goes just fine of course it's fruit the vegetable it's cucumber just fine okay I thank y'all

chalice event this year in victorville we had a blast i hope you guys enjoyed the video i made and we got a few products try and we went by hubby's edibles and they had a booth there in one of the buildings we checked them out and they gave us a little sampler of there I think it was the cherry strawberry we'll see in a second i guess but i'm going to do a little taste test of their a little fruit belt they call they were pretty awesome they chatted with us for a while and was in the video taste tester smells nice see what it tastes like like the fur growth alright I do get the canvas a little bit but yeah it's strawberry its deadly strawberry it covers it a little bit but you still have that aftertaste of cannabis a little bit a lot of people like that some people don't so that's what the after-effects i get from this that's the what's in my throat right now but then that tastes good if you had a role this be able to munch nail on this with a drink and hang out at the event that we have fun with this very good yeah they got a big role of this like you check out their side I'll have a UH it breaks apart really good real easy it's not doesn't stick to your teeth or anything either so that's nice yeah they have all kinds of flavors they have like strawberry watermelon think they have sour watermelon and green apple and that green apple they I think they are 75

"hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a super simple strawberry lollipop now I know a lot of people get really nervous or scared or think oh my gosh I'll Ollie pop how do you even make that and I know when I started making lollipops I was nervous to be handling molten-hot sugar but I promise it's really really easy it's so simple and as soon as you learn how to make a really basic lollipop you're gonna be hooked okay so the first thing you need to know about lollipops is everything all the ingredients get measured out so right here you can't really see it but I've got my measuring my food scale and what I'm gonna do is take my pot and set it on the scale and turn it on and that's going to bring it to zero so then what I'm gonna do is put my ingredients directly into the pot so the first ingredient in lollipops is glucose or corn syrup now when I'm making lollipops at the shop at Fiddlesticks I don't use corn syrup we use a non-gmo glucose that does not contain corn so we're not using corn syrup but this is the easiest thing to find if you're looking for your ingredients at the grocery store or at a craft store you might find glucose that's in a little tub but today we're going to use corn syrup and so what we're gonna do is pour this corn syrup directly in the pot and we are looking for 200 grams of corn syrup or glucose so I'm just watching it go up okay so we've got 200 grams of glucose or corn syrup in the pot so we're gonna tear this back to zero and then our next ingredient that's going in is pure cane sugar and so we're gonna put in 300 grams of sugar on top of our glucose so that's 300 grams and then the last ingredient in our lollipops is just water so I'm going to do 112 grams of water onto this so the key with the water is to pour it in really carefully so it doesn't splash your ingredients your sugar anywhere as long as you don't get sugar granules splashed up onto the side you're good to go you don't have to touch this again so what we're gonna do is move this on to a cooktop and turn on the heat and let it go okay so we've got our ingredients onto the cooktop I'm turning this on and so we're just gonna let this go we're gonna let it come to a boil you do not stir lollipop syrup so at this point everything is meshing well we're just gonna leave it alone that's probably the hardest part and also the easiest part of making lollipops just don't touch it I know it's so tempting to stir it so once this comes to a boil normally I would put in my candy thermometer but today I forgot my candy thermometer at the Fiddlesticks candy kitchen you don't have a candy thermometer hanging around you might have one of these this is a thermal thermometer it's one of those things that you can like point at the wall and see what the temperature is so this works for candy as well so you can just point it right at your syrup and it's gonna tell you what the temperature is so that's really important when making lollipops because you're going to want your lollipop syrup to come to 305 degrees or about 310 so on your candy thermometer typically it'll show you the hard crack temperature and that's what you really want when you're making Molly pops so once this comes to a boil if you've got a candy thermometer you're gonna put it in there because everything will be bubbling up nice and beautiful so while this is boiling I wanted to share with you how we're going to add our strawberry flavor into the lollipop syrup so you basically have three options my personal favorite way to flavor lollipops is using a really good Jam from a local jam maker so if you've got somebody in your town that makes really super yummy Jam go to them first because their flavor is going to turn up in your lollipop the best now if you don't have that handy like I don't today your next best bet is to use a flavor emulsion this can be found in the baking section of any craft store you'll see on the front it says bakery emulsion this is a Lorien gourmet brand now your third option if you don't have a an emulsion handy or you don't want to use an emulsion your last option is to use these tiny little candy oils it's from the same company Lauren and it's just a strawberry flavor oil so the biggest difference with the oil versus the jam or the emulsion is when you're going to add it to your lollipop syrup so if you're using a jam or any mole j'en you're gonna watch the temperature on your lollipop syrup and when it gets to 290 degrees that's when you're gonna add your flavoring in if you're using the oil like this you're gonna wait till it comes to the hard crack stage about 305 degrees or so and you're gonna pull it from the heat and then you're gonna add in your oil so the reason we do that is because the emulsion and the jam has some extra water that's gonna need to cook off whereas the oil doesn't okay so while our lollipop syrup is boiling remember we're not touching it we're gonna go ahead and prep our lollipop molds so you can find molds at any local craft store sometimes they'll be silicone like this one that's my favorite or sometimes they'll be those white plastic molds either way it'll work no big deal but if you've got a plastic mold you're gonna have to spray a little bit of nonstick cooking spray on it if you're using silicone it'll pop out really nice and easy no big deal so what I like to do is take a small baking sheet about this size and I put my lollipop mold on top of it because when we're pouring our lollipop syrup into the molds we're going to want to fit to get all the bubbles out and the easiest way to do that with these silicone molds is to have a baking sheet underneath so we're pretty much ready if we were gonna put any sprinkles in our lollipops we might put some sprinkles in now before we start pouring and then otherwise all we have to do is put our sticks in so we're going to prep our sticks into our molds and I put the top of the stick about halfway into the middle of the lollipop shape and we're just using a basic 2-inch lollipop today so that's it we're ready so as soon as that syrup is done boiling we can go ahead and start pouring our strawberry lollipops into the molds oh one last thing so one last tool that you're going to need for pouring your lollipops is a good glass measuring cup with a handle and a pour spout this makes it really easy to pour your lollipops and also reheat the syrup if it starts to get cooled down too quickly so make sure you have one of these handy and a little spatula would be super handy as well alright so our lollipop syrup just came off of the stovetop so it's still bubbling I'm gonna go ahead and pour in my oil my flavoring oil and you've got to be careful when you do this because sometimes it lets off a bit of steam and you can see it rising or you might be able to and some fumes with it so kind of keep your face away and I'm just stirring it in remember we didn't stir anything up until now don't stir the syrup until you add in the flavor so I'm just gonna stir it and let this steam roll off and keep going until all the bubbling stops alright so our lollipop syrups stopped bubbling all of the flavors mixed in really well now I want you to remember this is molten sugar it is so hot it looks really not scary but it is really hot believe me trust me I've accidentally burnt myself several times with a lollipop syrup and it hurts it is over 300 degrees so it's basically like sticking your hand in an oven that's liquid so just be careful don't let your kids do this part we're gonna be super careful but we're going to transfer the syrup the lollipop syrup from inside of this pot into our really helpful pouring measuring cups so we're going to do that now so here's the thing about lollipop syrup it's sticky it's sugar it's gonna make all these little strings it's gonna be messy you've just got to embrace the mess I feel like that's good life advice in general just embrace the mess just go with it you're gonna make a mess but it's actually surprisingly easy to clean up and as long as you take your empty pot and put it right into the sink with some water on it it'll actually be really simple to wash out as long as you get water on it before it starts to harden okay so at this point if you were gonna add any coloring to your lollipop syrup you're gonna want to do it right now I'm not planning to add any extra coloring I just kind of like it when it's the natural color but it's fun to play with color too so if you're gonna add color you want to use gel food coloring not regular food coloring because it's water-based gel food coloring will mix in better you only need a teeny tiny bit a little bit goes a long way with the color and the lollipop syrup so you would add that now mix it up with a small spatula or a little popsicle stick would work really well but for us we're ready to pour our super simple strawberry lollipop so we've got our mold we've got our sticks in there we've got our syrup here we're just gonna start pouring I like to use a spatula to kind of balance my my measuring cup and we're just going to pour very carefully into each mold let the syrup come up over the top of the lollipop that's where this tree three okay and then do a few taps to make sure that all the air bubbles come out okay so our strawberry lollipops we let them sit for about thirty minutes they're totally cool so if we touch them they're definitely cold cool and so now it's just time to take them out of the mold it's one of my favorite parts so all we do is gently lift and pull them out of the mold and you have yourself a lollipop now you could get really fun and creative and maybe put on a little freeze-dried lollipop on top of this to give it a I'm sorry a freeze-dried strawberry on top to kind of let your guests know it's a strawberry you could add all sorts of sprinkles or colors or anything but this is just your basic strawberry lollipop remember if you used Jam or even the emulsion typically there is some color that would come through so you might have a little bit more pink or red definitely use jam it'll look way more like strawberry but there you go you've got your hard candy lollipops", "A6-ApxPabg8": "hello I'm Jerry Ford we got Ivan Gonzalez here with me and we're gonna do another sucker

learn more about this camp you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and I made a totally different angle than I normally am because this hopefully was going to be the thumbnail so a lot of times we have to set them up and snap a quick picture before the video before I actually open them up and destroy them so let me zoom out a little bit cuz normally I would not be that way and that close these are the chupa chupa chups chupa chups melody pops i'm not sure what that is to be honest with you I see strawberry flavored that is a weird angle isn't it hold on a second I'm almost straight down this is all I would normally start a video so I can hold him up like that to you all right let's see who can read this I can't there's tons of information here and I can't die I don't know it's just such tiny tiny print and the camera will only focus so well on this tiny print then enough for you to help me out I just want to make a whistle that's all okay just want to whistle I feel like whistling with my whistle pop all right so the first layer has been removed from my whistle pop and now there's a second layer now my whistle pop appears to have a crack so let's see hopefully that's why we have to just in case Shh not a very good whistle on that one hopefully this one's not cracked and this isn't our first whistle tinea think we've gone 3 or 4 leavin at the maker lever there make it I used rules of it this one's not cracked so let's see Shh much better now this one said strawberry - so now I'm thoroughly confused because color wise I see two completely different colors again let's try the broken one Shh got a leak and the good one so it works pretty good oh yeah was the tooth sweet maker that we did I'm gonna just give it a taste maybe I can put it back together it almost has like a waxy coating on it Shh a little better hold on trying to fill in the gap Shh yeah it is a straw strawberry flavor and it's tasty it's good it's nice that you can whistle but you know of course if they're broke you're not gonna get a good whistle let's see if I can open this up a little bit better here while we we gotta look all at writing here look at how tiny that writing is I can't make out really any words there okay basically this will help something let's see if I could read any of this now this looks like chupa chups chupa chups chupa c hup ACH i ok nothing there helps me UK IC UK strawberry flavor lollipop ingredients ok so I can read that well it's tasty it works when it's not cracked so you can see the kind of design hole here and then travels through this and then out this area there's no other holes that I see anywhere unless the lollipop handle itself is a solid plastic so it's not used for thee noise oh wait it does look like it goes all the way through so I'm guessing then I'm not sure if it stops it or what hard to see inside hold on yeah I don't feel any air coming out of the side that's pretty secure so that's it that's all I can tell you and if you like this kind of stuff candy and related products look at the description for a playlist or search our chilli it's a melody pops in strawberry and look how happy

"cooking with jacob here have you ever made a lollipop well today i'm gonna show you how now let me show you the ingredients so we're going to be using some corn syrup i'm going to be using one third of a cup of corn syrup but before we put the corn syrup in there let me show i'm going to show you what happened so we're going to put some nonstick cooking spray in here right here mix it in well not really mix it in just spread it around and then we're gonna put the corn syrup in there so the reason why i put um our nonstick cooking spray in there is for when we pour out our corn syrup it doesn't stick in the cup and put that in the pot and as you can see this comes out smoothly and now i'm going to put in one cup of sugar and half a cup of water and we're going to mix it around with my plastic spatula and now we're going to put it on a hot plate and it's going to start boiling so as you can see like some of the water is starting to evaporate now and the sugar is starting to dissolve like it's almost done dissolving so we don't really have to spin it anymore you do not want this to burn at all this right here is a mold that we're going to put the lollipops in at least children should not be making this without adult supervision are an adult helping them we're going to put a thermometer in and see how high it gets because we're making hard candy so while we wait for this to get to 310 sorry 300 i have my molds put prepared here and the stick is already inside the we molds to get this all the way to 300 and right here it's about 220 and we need it to get higher than that so i'm gonna let it cook for a bit more we're at 280 right now fahrenheit and we were waiting for it to get to 300. so right now i'm gonna show you what you should do and shouldn't do so right here you want here's why we want to get it to the correct temperature we didn't let it to get to the correct temperature so now it's kind of just like taffy it's not correct but right here when we let it get to the like right temperature it came out like this which is how you want it to come out so this is something that we previously done my mom poured in the mixture for me so i'm gonna put some red food coloring in there and i'm gonna put in some blueberry flavor okay so i'm gonna show you how to pour some of the mixture now and my mom's gonna do the rest off camera oh wait oh i got stuck for a second need to twirl the sticks in here so it gets stuck in here so the molds are finished and if you don't have a mold you can put it on a flat surface or like on this tinfoil and make a design out of it like that okay so if there's like any of these little parts any little thin parts hanging off from here you can eat it because they dry up very quickly these are really good so these lollipops right here um the mixture it's gonna take about five to six hours to dry anything gets stuck on here you can wash it off with warm water the candies that are dry i'm going to bag them up and so i can give them to some of my friends here my candies are ready to go i'm gonna send them to some of my friends and family bye now and happy valentine's day so now let me show you how to make our chocolate strawberries so we're gonna dip our strawberries and some chocolate right here i'm gonna put on our parchment paper so it doesn't stick and then we can put some edible gel on there right here or you can put sprinkles on it like there and if you want you can a little bit of sprinkles on it right there and then if you let it dry and harden you can eat it and it's gonna taste nice and good",

get an adult to help you out do not make this alone to a sauce pan\nyou're going to add the sugar and some water and I also like to add some honey\nfor flavor your pan should be over low heat do not

Celsius or three hundred F also known as the hard crack stage on your thermometer this is going to\ntake anywhere between eight to ten minutes it really depends on your flame\nnow if you don't have a thermometer what you can do is cook this to a slightly\nand I mean slightly higher temperature and you'll know it's ready because the\nmixture will turn a slight amber color at this point turn off your flame\nimmediately or the sugar will burn and taste better I like to add one or two\ndrops of red food coloring and you'll see why in just a moment you're going to\ndip your strawberries into the mixture using a wooden skewer and swirl the\nberries to coat them completely and you're going to place these onto some\nparchment paper to cool now this is why I like to add red food coloring because\nif you have some strawberries that have some green bits such as this one when\nyou coat them in the mixture they'll turn a vibrant red so no matter how the\nstrawberries look guys always turn a beautiful red the\nstrawberries will harden pretty quickly but just to be safe\nwait at least 10 minutes before you eat these not only are these delicious guys\nbut there's so much fun to eat and

I'm going to name you Roxanne.", "7_McJKG1Zm8": "hey guys today's video is on how to make hard candy I'm I'm going to make lollipops for Christmas and the only need a few ingredients you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar 2/3 cup of corn syrup and 3/4 cup of water you're also going to need some kind of flavour I'm going to do cinnamon and then yours you want food coloring then you're going to need food coloring so let's get started first you're just going to need a pot this is a small batch so here is my pot I want to go ahead and put in my 2 cups of sugar 2/3 of corn syrup you're not going to get all that out so just do the best you can and then I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on medium-high then you're gonna add your water and you want to stir that up I put it on medium-high for a few minutes so this sugar can start to meal you just want to mix that up all we do now is wait just a few minutes and let that melt just a little bit get warm and I'm gonna turn it up to high heat and insert my candy thermometer okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn it up on high and you're gonna need a candy thermometer and when you put it in the pot you don't want the bottom to touch you just want it down in the sugar mixture and what we want to do you don't want to stir it you want it to get up to at the end it's going to get up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit but at 260 you're gonna add your food coloring if you want to add food coloring I'm going to add some red food coloring since I'm doing cinnamon and want to put in maybe three or four drops of that and you don't stir it up you just let it do its thing it's going to be a rolling ball and I'll show you when we get there okay while we're waiting on the sugar to bowl to get to temp I'm going to put sticks in my lollipop molds and this is the only part that I'll let mommy help me with because this is very dangerous that sugar gets up to 300 degrees and what little bit I got on my hand the other day you know it doesn't feel good so this is the only part that I will let her do because I do not want her to get burnt I don't know how many it's gonna take this candy mold works good except the the cut out part where the stick goes it's just not quite deep enough and whenever I put the sugar in there I have to turn the stick a little bit so it gets coated but that's okay that background noise is not chocolate tempering machines and they are noisy so sorry for the noise the sugar is starting to bowl so we got to wait for this to get up to 260 it's up to 200 right now and that is hot so when it gets to 260 I will put my food cart in and right back okay the mixture is about to 260 and I'm going to go ahead and put some food coloring in here and be careful it will steam do not stir it up it will mix around and then when it's done balling when it has gotten up to 300 you're gonna add the food care line and mix it up so it's gonna stir it up anyway almost 280 right now wrap for 300 just win put in this flavor right up to 295 so I'm gonna get ready and add the food coloring or shake the flavor all right open up my cinnamon hall take out the thermometer and shake it a little bit that's a pretty read or in the OL during it and be careful this is really hot it's pretty now I'm going to turn you around - all right I'm bad - pour too much it's hard to tell too much strong never done cinnamon I've just been doing fruit flavors would see that's what happens I can salvage that one on that before in his notes to me here too much the whole gram in there woof stick I didn't step to hurry times already starting to some of those need some more my toast cool and then I'll show you what they look like that is so strong my eyes are burning [Music] background on man and put it on there and just break it up into pieces [Music] I might pull that into little pieces for Billy but what I do next maybe insane I just have to put water back in the pot to clean it and put it back on stage to bowl get it from the old miser Burton and let it melt roll it that waste not some heart you consider oh and then there's some places that I can't get out hard to pizza water is really hot and let it melt too but this is what I do I might call it in two pieces but really because he said he wanted to summon some wax to make them just to put these it I don't know if they like school night spots Oh I cut it into pieces I'm not gonna do it perfect over there just getting old which is not always a perfect at all it's not for anybody been really hard it's so strong he's very emotional but since it's for really I don't care what it looks like [Music] just don't care my eyes nose still burnin so what I'm gonna do when that calls I'm just gonna wrap it up and wax paper for Billy to put in his pocket this is boring so I want to get that clean they're gonna have to clean the side on the sink so we're still waiting on these to cool they might be a couple here we go simple lollipops these are cinnamon and when you purchase in when you you cinnamon be sure to have a good ventilation I do not have that in here so there you go that's how to make hard candy most of it still shiny and we'll let it cool but I hope you enjoyed this video and got a good laugh of me coughing and hacking I hope you guys have a great day and stay tuned for more candy videos [Music]", "9A1pnlHUIX8": "guys welcome back to the room we try and strawberry candies got one for know okay I'll try it at the same time ready three my horrible let me dip it into me okay ready [Music] that's good strawberry strawberry really gave it flavor a little sister she likes just about issue so we were trying nothing I'm already one two three four five and you get that one once I think you think you hate the green thing okay ready no no okay how about try it my god the good leader you're just not ready [Music] Moon halle-loo [Music] hurt what's really shining I don't like delicious we mail [Music] [Music] [Music] nearly equal time because ducting get it that one doesn't get it what do you talk about just put on the part so see you guys in the next video bye", "uz6nyBXsyTI": "all right you guys are smashing yeah okay what it is would it be what it dude oh I have new toys it's gonna be insane life-changing and amazing according to this guy mr.

going to make the sugar glass coated our fruits so you will need a two cups of sugar and half amount of water give it a stir and turn on the heat to low and let sugar the job to the water first and then we are going to increase the heat to high and let it boil for eight to ten minutes you will see all the sugar is completely dissolved there's a lot of bubble going on and the sugar would start turning into light brown color okay meanwhile let's secure some our fruits so you can use this a thick bamboo skewers or just a thin bamboo skewer that's all you have just use the two of them so it was strong enough to hold the first and the last sugar i'm going to stir some strawberries you can use any fruit that you want like a Kiwi pineapple mango all works today I'm using green grapes and strawberries because their color is to top your eyes and it's just so pretty tango is very popular Chinese Street food it also popular in Korea too during the summer time and we use a bunch of different types of fruits and just secure them like this and coated it with the sugar to last what we are making here and selling on the street also this recipe is eight hundred years old when sugar boil like this just do not stir or touch it just let it reach down so you feel like you're getting close to this glass sugar glass is getting done just check with a bamboo skewer like this just cover it and dip in ice water check the texture if it gets hardened it's ready or if it gets a little smooshy like this it's not ready yet just let it boil a little longer I think mine is a couple more minutes to go I'm gonna take one more time I think they are ready to go see it covers my bamboo skewer really hard alright now I'm gonna start to deepen my fruits reduce the heat to low and tilt the pan and just roll your fruits just like this and let it drip the excess sugar glass and just place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet let's keep doing with the strawberry too and if it's a harder to roll it go ahead and use your spoon and cover it like this [Music] and do not attempt faced with this shooter right now or this let it cool because when sugar boy like this is over 300 degrees it will take your tongue off from your mouth isn't that hot so be careful my firts are so pretty coated evenly and shiny with the sugar glass I'm going to pop it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to let it cool all the way down before I taste it right my tongue Hulu is ready it looks so pretty significant till the glass is a hardened I'm just going to decorate it pretty pink turn that I filled out with the rainbow sprinkle you can do this with the beans and rice whatever they can hold this bamboo skewers they look so pretty well made kangaroo it will make super nice crunch sound let's see if I

taste calm and I bet you didn't know that you can make homemade lollipops with just two ingredients but the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to

and today we're going to be making some watermelon lime lollipops I really enjoyed making the lollipops last week and I thought it would be fun to do some more we're going to be using some watermelon flavor and some fresh lime zest to flavor these I am trying to reach 2,000 subscribers by my birthday in June so if you haven't hit subscribe go ahead and hit that button now and now here's how we're going to make these lollipops the first thing we're going to get started is our candy base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already measured out into my heavy bottom sauce pan because candy making is so precise you want to make sure that you don't waste any of that corn syrup we're then going to add 200 grams of granulated sugar and 75 grams of water we're going to put this on the stove until it reaches 315 degrees Fahrenheit our candy base is heating up on the stove and it's time to prepare our candy making station once this reaches temperature it's going to go really fast so I'm going to explain what we're going to do first we're going to take our hot pan and we're going to place it on a towel on our mat we'll then add our flavorings I have one gram of watermelon flavoring and I have two teaspoons of an unpacked lime zest we're going to pour that into the hot sugar syrup stir it in using a heatproof spatula well then pour that into a heat-safe joke pour our lollipops on to our Silpat mat I'm using my macaron run because it already has about one to one and a half inch circles already on it and that's the size little lollipops I want to make but you can use a piece of parchment paper and set if you like and you can draw the template on the back of them if you want I also have my lollipop sticks ready to go [Music] [Music] [Music] our lollipops are all forward and I got about 16 out of this batch but it depends on how big you make them we're going to let these cool on the trays for about 30 minutes to an hour and then you'll be able to pull them off they'll come

thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "3JosHua8zJk": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop but it's time for a new candy and I just know there's a little rip in the top there but that's okay it's a Mexican candy so check that description for a playlist or search the channel I can kind of see that so let's see here ah Moneta de la Huerta I think that's what it says don't know kind of plain on the back strawberry and cherry flavored so is this one of the spicy ones let's see Boop I just ripped it a little sticky Amy it's warm I don't see any spice on it I see a nice big man hand kind of like my hand oh it's kind of like my hand some people say you got some big hands well that's what that looks like so let me try it hmm now this is more like something I would be used to here in the United States straight flavouring no hot no spike do it wipe it off his finger it part of itself I just wiped it off too on a rag so there you go I've crunched part of it it's a to flavor and it's tasting it's good so if you like this type of candy more more us a standard flavors this will be good then if you want to try a Mexican candy you would like this one and thanks for watching it's really appreciate it later this video is now over if you want to see more Mexican candy check the description search a channel or just click here thanks for watching our video", "hdHmBzhT-MI": "Greetings my beautiful lovelies! Hello, it's Emmy, welcome back, today I'm going to be making Tanghulu. And Tanghulu comes from China and it is a dessert that you can find from street vendors, and it's typically made with ha or Hawthorn fruit that look like little red crab apples that are skewered and Dipped into a sugar syrup that hardens and sets and it looks like resin, it's clear It's gorgeous. And then when you eat it, it has this great big crunchy crackle of sugary sweetness, and it sounds fantastic So Hawthorne fruit or ha is not really common here in the US, actually I've never seen it before, but I've seen alternate versions with fresh Strawberries, and now we're really coming in to fresh strawberry season here. My sons and I just went and picked them the other day so I have a basket of beautiful strawberries and I'm going to make a version using these So the first thing I'm going to do is get my sugar syrup going, it does take a while for the sugar to get to the right temperature (pans clatter) and get myself saucepan and a thermometer. Now, I have a spotty relationship when it comes to making Sugar syrups, if you want to see me fail a few times, you can check out the Dragon's beard video Put the links there, so we're going to be 1 cup of granulated sugar, 1/2 cup To that, we're gonna add 2/3 of a cup of water (Emmy makes a neeurp noise) so what we're going to do here is bring this up to a boil and evaporate a lot of the water I'm going to bring this all the way up to the hardball stage about 260 265 degrees and then we'll kill the heat and then coat our fruit. So it's important that your thermometer remains submerged So I'm going to double this recipe and I'm adding two cups of sugar and one and 1/3 cups of water So while my syrup is boiling I'm going to prepare the fruit So I'm gonna set this off to the siiiide Humanah Humanah I mean really Ya'll are beautiful. I'm just gonna take off  the little stem here So in Japan when you buy strawberries they come in little flats just little boxes and they're arranged like this with the little butts Pointing upwards. They're just so cute and irresistible. Next, we're going to skewer the strawberries. I've got a variety of sizes here My pot is pretty small. So I think I'm gonna opt to go for shorter skewers I think traditionally they use long skewers and they display them that way on the carts But they're also using large pans of syrup where they can just drip it on top of the fruit So, but I'll try both and see what happens This is after just a coffee stirrer and I used scissors to make a little point on there And I like the idea of using a flat because then the strawberry won't rotate as I I'm pouring syrup on there Cute So this size skewer I can have five I Think I'm just gonna stick with these tube sizes. Cause I like that Although I'm tempted to make the big one too, and we're almost there. We're at the hardball stage. We're at 263 Degrees, so the next step is to take our strawberries and we're going to pour the syrup on top and then set them aside on A tray that has been covered with some parchment paper. I'm going to step on the steps will cuz I'm a little vertically challenged. Okay. use a spoon and just Ladle the syrup all over the fruit Cover the strawberries completely What is it about a clear finish that is just so Sexy I don't know. It's like all those resin tutorials It's just because it's clear, you know. Alright, let's try a longer one So cool Quickly onto a tray Okay, why is it getting not clear? Not into that. I'm not sure what's happening here. But my syrup is now not clear. I Think maybe there's some water that got into here and so it's starting to seize. Look it's turning and turning into like taffy That's not cute Alright sugar syrup experts what's happening here? So I'm heating it up Maybe I should have left it cool and not increased the heat. This is totally seized Wow There's another sugar fail for you Okay lovelies I think I have yet again Failed when it comes to making the proper temperatures for syrup now while my first attempts look quite beautiful glistening gorgeous covered in a Resinous almost plastic shell they're not as hard as they should be although I do have to say it's about 100 percent humidity right now because we have got thundershowers going on outside Maybe that has something to do with it I suspect it has to do with the temperature of the syrup and then my subsequent attempts and depth looking like this my sugar completely Seized and it's not beautiful and clear. Although it is much harder. So I suspect what happened is that a little bit of moisture got into my syrup and then it act as Catalyst and started this kind of crystal formation that happened but sugar experts do chime in with your expertise Alright, let's go ahead and taste these itadakimasu! See, that's not supposed to happen. this is definitely more like a taffy it's sticking to every crevice in my mouth and it's supposed to have an Shatteringly glassy like texture. Now there are tons of ASMR videos of people just eating tanghulu let's try this one, which I think will have a better texture here we go. Mm-hmm. As far as taste goes they're absolutely delicious You've got a juicy juicy strawberry in the middle That's a little bit warm from the hot syrup. Then you've got it covered in sugar. I mean, it's fantastic. Ohh, look it doesn't even come off the dish All right, as you might expect I'm not giving up on this sugar and strawberry nonsense I'm back to do this again with a different recipe and a slightly different setup as you can see hair's in pigtails So that means it is very humid outside But I've closed all the windows. I've got the AC on so That might help I am also back with a new recipe Thank you guys so much for chiming in on social media to tell me that SAS-ASMR has a recipe that works. So That's what I'm doing today This recipe includes a little bit of corn syrup and I have to cook this up to a higher temperature Which I think is the major fault of my last experiment that I cooked to 265 degrees which is the hardball stage and I should have cooked it to a hard crack stage I was following the recipe directions, but they didn't work for me into a lovely pot. We've got here 2 cups of sugar doink 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup That's new and in her video, she uses a dry measuring cup for liquid ingredients So I'm just gonna do exactly what she did because I want this to work What is it with me and like hot sugar? It just doesn't work like Dragon's beard anyone? Not perturbs, not perturbs. Happy. Okay, according up of water Which is significantly less than the other recipe Okay. All right. I'll crank this up Let's get her going And we'll stick the thermometer in there and that will be our indicator of doneness Do do do do do. Another thing I learned in her video Was that she skewered just a few strawberries rather than having the beautiful long stick of them Which the vendors have in China which makes sense because they've got vats of this syrup And so they have a lot of surface area to drizzle the strawberries But since I'm working with a relatively small amount of syrup it makes sense to just have a couple berries on the stick and then dip the berries into the syrup rather than Using a spoon to drizzle it less chance of contamination last time when I did this my syrup started to seize as in it turned into Crystals, and it was definitely not a syrup anymore. I'm hoping to avoid that too by doing that kind of dip in twirl technique Let us see don't we love failure, failure is great. Actually, we should fail more often. I keep telling myself because this is how learn Certainly. I have learned a lot about candy syrups, and I've learned that you must get it to the correct temperature Now if you don't get it to the correct temperature, then it's not gonna do what you want to do, right? Right. I refer you to the Dragon's beard video because that is full of you know, candy syrup Follies, but it's good It really is good And I'm trying to be aware of that as a mother as well to let my children fail and that is the best teacher Surely so there's the syrup. It is pretty cold that 120 degrees almost and it's just Starting to bubble and we're just gonna let this go for about 15 minutes Holy Smokies, it's already at 220 okay, so I think the corn syrup must accelerate something here because when I make Fondant for my bees, which is the winter candy that my oh I keep bees By the way, if you guys don't know that I refer you to my bee blogs I make fondant for them in the winter time and it has corn syrup in it And I noticed that it comes up to temperature a lot Faster when I use corn syrup. Huuuuuuh Food scientists do let me know what's going on here is if the corn syrup is ready established to a certain Something something that it gets it to go to like to holy smokes 32 to 40 like last time when I did this I was trying to get it to the hardball stage and it took me forever And this is already at almost 240 degrees. Okay SAS-ASMR  I'm already liking your recipe. This is beautiful Don't know if it will be successful yet but it's a good sign that was super fast that was about seven minutes It's already at hard crack. Okay, now I have to work really quickly this time I'm gonna take the strawberries and just dip them into the syrup like that Allow it to drip. Okay, that's looking gorgeous Set on my tray yes dip drip Yesss! These are looking fab now they just got to get crunchy, okay That's actually a lot easier than spooning it too. last one oh Yes So far it is looking beautiful I'm so excited and that happened so fast in seven minutes when I had this on medium high It came to temperature *sighs* SAS you're a genius Thank you guys so much for suggesting her recipe look at the So out of failure comes success and it makes the success all the sweeter, yes! I'm so excited about this. These are perfect and beautiful and they're crunchy as I can tell already They're gorgeously clear. I didn't have any seizing the temperature came up very very quickly. In less then half the time that SAS said so Beautiful look look at that It's like they've been dipped in resin. Alright, here we go. itadakimasu! Delicious Delightful so much better than my first batch the first batch was chewy and The strawberry was juicy and delicious as well because these are fresh and ripe strawberries But the textural sensation that goes on here is so much fun the strawberry is slightly warm because the syrup is so hot and just so juicy, and then you've got the sugar coating on the outside that is just glass shatteringly crisp so that contrast between textures is so surprising and delightful and then of course, you've got the delicious flavor of strawberry and then just sugar I mean So much fun. What a great dessert. All right, I'm gonna eat this last one before. All right Really really great Super fun. Alrighty I hope you guys enjoyed that one.

look like real lollipops but much healthier okay this is the ingredients you're going to need you will need a watermelon some delicious delicious grapes you want you can use raspberries blackberries or blueberries if you have them and any shape cutter i'm using a heart over here and you will need some skewers and remember you have to ask a parent to help because it's really dangerous if you're a little kid using the skewers so always ask a parent to help with the skewers part the first step you're going to do is you're going to get the heart cutter and cut out the watermelon with the heart cutter to make a heart thing you remember you could use any heart cutter or any cutter you have and if you don't have any of the cookie cutters you could also use play-doh cutters after cutting down and you're happy with the shape get the grapes and the skewers get this one skewer and put the grape on top and remember the grown-up has to help put everyone on top until it's fully stacked then you will put the heart watermelon on top of your skewer and then there is your heart lollipop all completed you", "9SaVO3PN_vE": "welcome to DIY or die today we're going over strawberry so recently someone asked for flavor updates on strawberry mainly because there are a bunch of new strawberries that have come into the realm and we want to take a look at it we want to see which ones are good which ones aren't so good which ones are used for different things I'm going to rank my top ten and the rest are ones that I think are good maybe just not top 10 territory so let's get started the first thing that I want to do is get get off some of the ones that we already know about tfh strawberry TFA strawberry ripe capella sweet strawberry these are three of the quintessential must-have strawberries in my opinion they're very standard they're used in so many different recipes and I just highly recommend that you you have all three of these these strawberries because they will be useful in different scenarios so for instance I like to use TFA strawberry as more as like a natural strawberry one that just has like a nice body to it I like to use ripe strawberry if I want more of that strawberry top note and I like to use two each strawberry if I'm mixing it with milks or creams or I need it for more sweeter candy type strawberry note in my recipe and I do know that TFA strawberry ripe some people have problems with it in terms of it being harsh and some people have problems tasting both TFA strawberry ripe and TFA strawberry if you are one of those sweet strawberry non tasters I do have some recommendations here for you so let's continue next I want to get away some of the other ones we already know about we have flavor are just juicy strawberry and flavor art strawberry as well as any where shisha strawberry and jungle flavors strawberry sweet I once a juicy strawberry came out I really really enjoyed it I think this is a great natural strawberry with a nice top end it's sort of like blending TFA strawberry with Capella's sweet strawberry or TFA strawberry ripe it's like a strawberry blend and then flavor art strawberry is just more of your standard strawberry though it's a little bit deeper and there's also a little bit more of naturality to it so you kind of get a little bit more of that core strawberry flavor that green strawberry flavor as well as some of its like tartness it's not too crazy it's still really good strawberry anywhere shisha strawberry is definitely more jammy it's more subdued and it has more of that wild strawberry flavor though it is nice and sweet and it does pack a nice top note as well some people think that this is the best strawberry I really do enjoy I don't think it's the best one but I do enjoy it and it is very useful in many situations I tend to like to pair it if I'm going to be pairing other berries or other deeper fruits then I'll go with the shisha strawberry and then jungle flavor strawberry sweet is certainly a good strawberry if you need one that is a little bit more heavy on the top end and also a little bit more pinkish more of like a candied artificial strawberry next I want to talk about flavors alpine strawberry this is a phenomenal strawberry it's lavoris best strawberry in my opinion it is a pretty expensive flavoring there is a nice premium on it the way that they produce it it just makes it more expensive so they sell it at a much higher premium but I do think it's worth it so this is one that I would recommend to your strawberry non tasters it's a delicious more natural strawberry though it does have a great strawberry top note that is a little more on the artificial side just sweet it really it's it's not as if it's a candy strawberry just a sweeter brighter strawberry top note with a really nice natural wild strawberry body to it there's really no tartness to it there's no off notes it's one of the better strawberries I really do enjoy it I highly recommend you pick it up next is real flavors strawberry now this is a strawberry that I find myself using a lot more recently mainly because it's very very different from a lot of these strawberries on the board this strawberry does pack a little bit more of a wild strawberry flavor more of a fresh strawberry flavor it almost as if like it contains some strawberry skin some strawberry rind on the outside if very very accurate to a strawberry flavor though it is a little bit jammy or two so you get some nice body to it if you're looking for a strawberry that has good body real flavor strawberry is the one that I would recommend then I want to go on to the low sea strawberry de Lucy strawberry is a newer strawberry will off relatively new and it's a pretty good strawberry as well the real only problem that I have with the Lotus your strawberry is that it's quite light and it's quite thin so you're gonna be using it up anywhere up from five to ten percent and still even at those percentages it can get a little bit lost in the mix if you're looking for more of a subtle strawberry one that kind of just hangs out in the bottom of the recipe doesn't really show its head too much this could be a good option just know that this shrubbery isn't the most present then I want to talk about Hanks ins strawberry this is a great strawberry if you want more of that wild strawberry flavor again it's kind of similar to real flavors though I would say it has a sweeter note to it it lives a little bit brighter it doesn't sit in the body as much it is an overall really good strawberry though and this is one that I think is slipping through many people's radars check it out it's it's quite different like it is with real flavors it's quite different from the rest of the strawberries sweet strawberry from vape train not my biggest pick not my bit nah I'm not the biggest fan of this one mainly because I feel it's it has more of like a berry flavor less of a pink strawberry flavor it just seems to miss the mark in my opinion when you taste it there's almost like a black currant sort of grayish note to it and the accuracy is just really not there so it's not one that I would recommend and there are other strawberries schuster strawberry is a little bit more of the same of this just maybe a little bit deeper just has a deeper strawberry flavor or whatever sort of flavor that this is trying to emulate this is that but deeper wonderful flavor of strawberries I have strawberry gummy candy here and I have strawberry baked strawberry baked is exactly what it sounds like it's a sort of reduced down strawberry flavor that's kind of has like its own natural baked sugars in there it's a lot deeper it's a lot closer to real flavor strawberry than anything else it's it's a really interesting strawberry as a strawberry top no as a shrub or in a note it's not quite there because it is it just a different ingredient altogether now you have their strawberry gummy candy which is exactly again what it says it is it's more along the lines of like that artificial strawberry flavor that tries to emulate candy it's sweeter it's brighter it's it's mainly on the top doesn't have much body and in that case it's pretty damn good I would really only to using it if you want that strawberry candy flavor in your top notes it is a little bit thinner it doesn't quite have the same sort of weight some of the other other ones do but it does have a really nice top note to it so check it out if you're interested in in strawberry candy flavors then we have here Molen berries sweet strawberry and they're wild strawberry they're a wild strawberry I'm not the biggest fan of I think it's just a little too there's too much of an off note there I get an odd alcohol fake berry a off note and it just kind of ruins that flavor for me they're sweet strawberry is better though the problem that I have with this one is that it is too thin it doesn't quite have any real weight behind it and it just kind of lingers in the top it's nice if you need that if you need that very slight sweet strawberry top note this one would be a good one because you're really not going to crowd the body or the base layers at all and finally we have two new TFA strawberries we have TFA shrubbery yogurt and tfh sweet strawberry I really really do enjoy these two strawberry flavors now the strawberry yogurt I think you I wouldn't really use this as a strawberry I would basically use this as a one shot it's an excellent strawberry yogurt flavor I have nothing else to say about it I think it's delicious as a strawberry yogurt the sweet strawberry though I think it does rival Capella's sweet strawberry which is one of my most used strawberries on on the board here I haven't quite done extensive extensive testing in replacing sweet strawberry and this is actually super sweet in replacing sweet strawberry I just I just haven't figured out if it is a good one to one substitution that just makes it better but there have been a lot of scenarios where I preferred TFA sweet strawberry over Capella's sweet strawberry it has similar tone and has similar top notes has similar body as similar weight to it very similar to it just slightly different just slightly more refined alright so we're gonna start with number 10 and in the number 10 spot would be anywhere she's strawberry I do enjoy using it in specific situations not in most of them so while I do recommend it and I recommend everyone check it out I don't personally think it's the best shrubbery but it's the number 10 spot next is strawberry sweet from jungle flavors so this is the one that I use if I need like a sweet strawberry candy accent just on the top very useful in those situations flavor art strawberry is next I the way that I like to see play for our strawberry is just a better you know where she's your strawberry just has a little bit more presence to the flavor but sometimes you don't always want that next would be real flavor strawberry I love how different and deep and sort of Jamie this strawberry is next would be juicy strawberry this has been really fun to use because it sort of combines two of my favorite strawberries though doesn't necessarily give you the versatility of those two strawberries separately so it kind of sits in the middle at my number what is that number six then I think sweet strawberry from TFA been really really enjoying this new strawberry from them and I think a lot of you guys will as well then alpine strawberry probably my my favorite solo strawberry probably the shrubbery that I like to use when I need natural strawberry flavor this is the one I go to while it's expensive I do think it's worth the money strawberry ripe in third place I love it I personally enjoy it I don't think it's harsh I just love the flavor that I get from it a nice bright sort of pink strawberry flavor for any situation will come through in any recipe excellent tia fish strawberry beats it though mainly because it is more versatile it does have more presence and it's it's just like the standard strawberry flavor in my opinion but number one capella sweet strawberry I just use this so much I really enjoy the flavor from it I use it in so many and so many recipes as a strawberry so versatile so forgiving you can crank it from 1% all the way up to 10% and it'll work in every situation excellent with creams if you're looking for a strawberry milk or strawberry cheesecake stuff like that capella sweet strawberry there's not a situation where this really hasn't worked in so that's my strawberry breakdown for 2019 maybe in the next 2-3 years we'll do another one and update you on all the new strawberries shout out to all the honorable mentions that are here

there welcome to stated his kitchen today I am SuperDuper duper excited because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at this time of year thank you so much for watching my video if you enjoyed it then please click subscribe because

terrorism that's how seriously I take this [Music]", "KBY8akECFIs": "hey guys it's leslie welcome to my very first episode of kitchen cookies it's basically going to be a series of quick videos of me in the kitchen they're all going to be five minutes or less that is the goal but don't quote me on that for kitchen cooking number one i'm going to making candied strawberries i seeing it it's all over tiktok right now it's all over instagram it's all over pinterest it's all over everything right now i've heard mixed reviews i've heard they're good i've heard they're bad i've heard it's a weird texture i've already given it a try first thing is ingredients so i have sugar and water those are the two ingredients it's quarter sugar eighth a cup of water push it in the pan pour the water over the sugar i'm going to give it just a quick stir just to get all the sugar down no this is not brown sugar this is sugar in the raw so it's unbleached sugar that's why it has that brown color to it but it is white or cane sugar so that's why it looks like that and we're gonna turn that on medium now i don't have a k thermometer in the video that i watched she did not have a candy thermometer she said to leave it until it says bubbly stage and it like turns golden brown i'm just gonna wing this i'm just hoping i'll recognize it when it makes that like bubbly texture here i have just a little bit of water and a brush i'm going to brush all the sugar crystals down off the edge seen that in other videos and apparently that can make it crystallize which is not what we want um so just gonna do that as you can probably tell i don't really know how to candy strawberries um but i've seen a lot of videos of people who i think they know how to do it every day is turned out pretty okay and i'm just using information from the videos another video said to use a little brush with the water to go around the edges so that it doesn't crystallize and i believe i trust them so i did it i hope it works is to slice the strawberries all right my strawberries are cut so the tops are off top's in a pile and i'm not going to throw away the tops because my family compost so in the compost bucket i'll make super great soil for next year's garden next step is to skewer the strawberries i don't have skewers so i'm using metal straws halfway through i think that worked pretty well i went ahead and turned off my sugar because it is at this golden brown stage i don't know but that's what hers looked like in the video i'm gonna go with it remove it from the heat take my skewers and just twirl the strawberry in as you can see my sugar is kind of crystalline around the edge and the bottom it may have overcooked again i don't have a candy thermometer so i'm just going to wing it the only thing about using the straws that i don't really like right now is that they're falling and they're spinning you can see it's spinning and that's not um that's not me spinning the straw that's just it's actually spinning ah all right my four strawberries are done let me show you how they look look at that you can see they're kind of glistening in the light okay the strawberries look great they look all swirled and nice and kind of lazy i'm gonna pop them in the fridge and let them sit there for a little bit just to like harden up all the way all right so strawberries out of the fridge and i have lost hope for them uh i think my sugar definitely crystallized let me show you guys what i'm talking about if you guys can see they're like bumpy okay guys don't use metal straws they're still like gooey they didn't really get that glass coating they were supposed to get and look they're dripping i think my sugar definitely crystallized um okay guys it's overcooked maybe it didn't burn i don't know definitely use a candy thermometer the one girl did it without don't do it without unless you actually know what you're doing this side looks a little bit glazing that's only because it was sitting in its own pile of juice that had fallen off of all the others but for the sake of the video i'm gonna try it it just tastes like you rolled a strawberry around in like corn syrup and sugar there's no corn syrup in this i didn't put corn syrup in it but i kind of got a texture like gooey thick corn syrupy i think maybe i just made simple syrup by accident i don't know what i did if you know what i did comment down below i'd love to know how to fix this i'd love to know if the sugar was the problem the type of sugar i used was a problem so if you know how to fix this definitely let me know in the comments i'm gonna say this for the fail but it still tastes good so until the next episode bye", "vK9gUUY376g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "yz5hrijYjA0":

welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser calm if

basically honeybees they do a pretty good job of pollinating okay without the honeybee we probably wouldn't have a lot of vegetables that we we need okay that we eat but the bumble bee actually pollinates a lot better it's a more efficient pollinator it'll fit according to literature I read it'll visit a flower eight times more than a honeybee will so that's why I tend to buy the bumblebees okay now the bumble bee hive that I purchased comes with a queen and and some I forgot the name of the the brood comes with a brood as well and it lasts about six to eight weeks okay and it also has these doors that you can open and close so if I want to spray a chemical but I don't want to hurt the bees I can open it up just so far and the bees can go in but they can't get out so and then after I've done spraying if I want to wait a little bit then I just open up and I both go in and out so it's kind of cool nope I haven't been stung by a bumble bee ever well when I was a kid I stepped on one I got stung but no but yeah I don't I mean I've even they're pretty tame and I've been busy harvesting and there'll be a bumblebee come up and a flower right there and I just kind of went like that one time and it just flew off and you know you know the the bees that fly around you guys know they're all female yes okay the males are useless useless in that society other than other than we can say other than pollinating the Queen but it's fertilizing the Queen all right okay so sometimes you're gonna get strawberries that look like this this could be cold temperature freezing temperatures so the pollination just doesn't occur all right or it just could be no winds okay heat can also cause that thrips trips are a little tiny insects that can feed on the flowers and damage them and then also the lack of these okay but usually we'll see a lot of this kind of misshapen fruit early in the season because it's a cold temperature so if you let if your flowers didn't freeze but they may have not gotten pollinated correctly so you'll get some miss shape and fruit all right is that fruit still good yeah just let it ripen up and you know cut it in two you can eat it or but you know I give all my seconds to some growers who like to make jams and jellies out of them okay and some some of this stuff is a really nasty looking yeah should taste the same uh-huh some people prefer the smaller berries compared to the larger berries they say they're sweeter but most of your berries that you initially picked for the first berries that come out they call them the King berries they are usually the largest okay you can also tell how big the berry is by how big the flowers are your flat your major flowers in the beginning are gonna be big and then they progressively get smaller throughout the season okay so by the time you're almost done you may be picking a lot more berries but you're still that your weights gonna probably be less so but you know I hate wasting a single berry so I'll pick it no matter what all right things to consider on your plant types June bearing or ever bearing I think I kind of went over that or the day neutral your June bearing are gonna produce generally in the spring and it's going to be a shorter period of time generally four weeks maybe depending on the temperatures your ever bearing certain varieties that do everbearing they're gonna produce a small amount but over a longer period of time and they may be less sensitive to the heat as well temperatures are important okay for producing the flowers as well and the Crown's so they that's why they need that cold temperature and that's why it's best not to buy your plants in the springtime and plant them in the spring you can't plant them in the spring but you might want to keep them shaded and protected and keep them as cool as possible you might get a little bit of fall production but then you're gonna want to wait and keep them alive until the next next year all right we've already talked about soil type irrigation we've kind of covered that as well air and soil temperatures really once the temperatures reach about 55 degrees in the soil our plants are really starting to produce okay yes you had a question I yeah the question is am i trying different kinds of berries yes I try different varieties I've got six varieties I know which ones if I'm gonna do a test I know which ones are best for me because I like to get the higher yields sometimes I wanted a berry that gets a lot of disease because I'm testing disease control products but I'll show you the varieties here in just a second yes it's too hot so you want to keep them as cool as possible because I've had my berries in generally in the first week of June they're just gonna start to dry up so we tried clipping him one time to see if they would regrow in the fall it didn't work out very well because they got the student worker that I told to clip I'm he cut him way down too deep and cut off all the crowns so that was a waste of a day of work all right oh yeah this just shows different varieties here I thought this was pretty cool I've never seen a blue strawberry before but it's a you know obviously it's a patriotic photo here red white and blue strawberry so I don't know how you tell when these two are right I guess you just have to try it and see and taste them so alright oops fertilizers another nutrients they need lots and lots of nitrogen okay for growers that are out in the field they can put on about anywhere from 150 to 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre okay so that's a lot it's basically about a pound of nitrogen per acre per day so they'll put it out throughout the season I'd really like to put half my fertilizer at planting and then I'll just kind of once a week I'll add some fertilizer and I've used Miracle Grow I've used anything anything that can go through the drip irrigation is good but when I used like a standard balanced fertilizer like a 20 20 20 without micronutrients and without the acidity my plants just didn't perform all right so we've already talked about the June bearing everbearing and de neutrals okay any questions on those yes the everbearing Oh day-neutral it's like everbearing okay but it it's insensitive to day length so a lot of the strawberry varieties are sensitive to day lengths so once it reaches a certain amount of your photo period it'll kick in the flowering so they're insensitive of that so they're gonna produce smaller amounts of flowers over an extended period of time for us I don't like the everbearing or the day-neutral in our area because it just gets too hot too fast and so my yields are always lower that's why I go for the June bearing type which generally it'll start in you know late February early March and then I can oftentimes pick until June but again those berries are gonna get smaller and smaller and smaller throughout the season so all right this just shows some cultivars that I've got out there right now and I have this on white plastic and that may be one of the reasons we get really hot and so I thought well I'll try the white plastic and see if that keeps them a little bit cooler but maybe in my production my plant production didn't get as big this year but you can see here different varieties Kamino rial is the variety that I like best so far I get really large berries high yield and it's done it's done the best for me it's not quite as sweet as some other berries but it you know it's still pretty good berry flavor fest is a new one this these are all taken on the same day you can see the growth just for us really isn't there so that's probably not gonna be a good variety for us and these other varieties Lucia Ruby June's her scarlet and sensation I have no idea I guess maybe if you come up to my strawberry field day on the 21st we might be able to do some taste testing but I don't know about those varieties yet yes festival strawberry festival yes I've grown that one the question was have I but it's it's the variety strawberry festival out of Florida yes okay yeah I've grown that one and that one's actually pretty good but my yields were still higher with Camino rial it comes in a little bit earlier than Camino in it but it's a nice firm berry and I think I've got a slide here in just a second show some more varieties yes I don't know any of these yet I think this one is supposed to be really sweet but again it doesn't look like it's producing much there we go these are some varieties I grew a couple of years ago Chandler is really sweet and it's a standard variety so it's it's a good one to grow if you can find it and it's easy to grow it gets a little bit mushy for me and maybe it's just because of our weather conditions a lot of times when I'm done picking with it my hands will be entirely red okay so it and it doesn't store quite as well as say something like Albion's and everbearing variety it produces a nice firm fruit it's a good shipper if you want to store it and that's what a lot of the growers down in pochi grow the algae on and it's but it's an everbearing variety again Venezia grows really big berries but again they're they're not quite as sweet Comoros a-- is another good one to try and you can buy these online you can order if you're looking to or you know order a thousand or more if you've got a lot of space you want to grow them in you need you need to actually grow up orderman June so that the growers can produce them most of it you can buy it I think as few as 50 but it's gonna cost you more yeah yeah Master Gardener group could order a bunch of them in get it cheaper that way first a 10th of October okay I know there used to be a grower whether there is a grower out of Arkansas that produces plugs of festival Goodson farms I think you can buy as low as 50 but I think it would probably be best if you actually got together as a group and purchased them that way okay so but festivals good and sweet it comes in earlier than say or is the communal rial radiance is a nice Florida berry really good shape good flavor but it's not very wind tolerant okay I had it outside and it just turned to shreds okay but inside a high tunnel or if it's protected it does really really well yeah Chandler Chandler is really good and sweet and but it's an older variety it's you know it's probably from the 60s but it's a it's a good one to start with yep that means it's not right so like these right here we pick them when they're ripe but we have to sell them pretty quick but you know what they just we've sold them at the farmers market and they go within an hour you can sell 500 pounds within an hour you know because we're in we're in at Strawberry Desert all right and again $7 a pint so this this is a two-pound container and that's that goes for about 10 bucks", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "2Y9y__hRY0U": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "P3-EteSrz3A": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shut up I don't buy the thumbnail you realize we're going to be doing some hammering some cutting in dissecting of candy and this candy is we actually did a video this that I didn't eat it I didn't do anything in the video but there's been a ton of comments there on that video so it's time to finally get some more and break them open because I want to see what's inside this candy so I bought a little screwdriver set because I'm going to use those as a chisel and then there's four kinds here in regards to flavors but only to bugs we have the Scorpion and the worm and unique flavors here what do we got banana tequila blueberry and strawberry so I'm going to open up one of these first so these kilo one and then probably not all of these but one of these maybe the banana let's just look to see where the bugs are placed how's that this one here is right near the edge so I should be able to break through this pretty easy now the scorpion that's a nice big scorpion and the blue one this one here seems a little disheveled and then this one's pretty nice too mmm I might want to break open a disheveled one but we'll decide I hope you're prepared I guess people have headphones on so I'll be doing some hammering as you can tell I should need to warn you that it's not a normal video it's a little sticky it's gonna be a messy video obviously almost out okay let's take a good close look at that it's gonna be hard on the brown kind of blends in so he's right at the edge so I should be able to chip away enough to get in here I'm going to use one of my finer little screwdrivers and just chip away a section here let me try this flavor okay so I rounded out right by Oh super sticky that's your different shot but sticking to my teeth I'm trying to isolate it or her or it whatever this bug is the stickiness I realize how sticky was gonna be Wow now I need to come down this way we're just getting right into this whoo look at him he's somewhat mushy he broke a little bit there be a little more careful well little bug pieces just fell out I think for the most part most of them is intact there's the front some kind of bugs spine in there is it a rope he just broke he's so brittle I thought we had a tact worm close it was a close dissection you get another little tool in here and see if I can take my worm apart it's very dry the worm it sure does look like a real bug I hope you're running well there's no way that's a real bug well this piece looks challenging to eat it had a very well I've never had bugs before but I'm thinking that I just ate a bug the flavor on this not too strong this hmm interesting I'm not sure I'll do that again it does look like a crystal or a piece of glass doesn't it when I break it now it just tasted like sugar really there's no it's hard to die dissect digest I mean to pick out different flavors when you're biting a chunk of sugar um but it did have some kind of I guess bug flavor to it like the dryness of that hmm kind of piece stuck in my throat let's check out this guy here let's move this worm yes this is gonna be one of those videos that will go down in Lucky Penny shop history bug pieces everywhere strange dissections but you know that's what everybody wants to see so I'm just going on with what everybody wants to see they wanted to see me eat it they wanted to see the inside okay this one's gonna be much harder I think if I break off half it's very chewy that's better last Oh strawberry flavor much better than tequila work on my hair I'm not this one I'm try everybody I don't want to use we broke his front piece off see here look on this side I took that candy out of my mouth because it's very wants to stick to my teeth let's keep going I want to get to the body and we're working our way in oh look I put a little hole in my cutting boards oh man all the name of dissection I guess oh we got some of the body exposed hold on see it there let's get in it looks like this is just gonna be one of those cool look his leg came off right there see it's exposed now and here we go getting closer there's another body piece now here we go I'm going right into the main body chunk look at that it almost got them fully exposed now I'll hold this here and split them right in half oh there we are we are in come on bug show yourself it's okay don't be afraid I'm not gonna eat you oh there we go there's for sure bug pieces here now this is not as easily to get out as the UM the worm who would eat this now let's go let's hear it in the comments oh now you're all gonna think I'm crazy here okay I think that's pretty much the main piece this is just not a normal video Oh something saying eat it but then something saying don't eat it there maybe I should reconstitute this in a little water a little warm water let me do that I'll be right back I'm gonna get some water all right here we go I got some water you know when I started this video I never thought I'd get to this point I never have any real plan these are like a forceps that I found in a collection of tools that I had and it's warm water so I'm hoping it just melts off the the sugar which it is let's put too much pressure let me just let it sit in there basically almost hot water yep that there is a bug and the forceps are or if I call them forceps let's see now most of that is melted off yep that's some kind of bug matter well I don't know what I've resolved here this one's really tasty that's for sure what I eat the whole thing that's a good question I got bug skin everywhere what a mess uh I'll leave it in the comments eat it yes or no and what did we solve hmm it's gonna think about that well maybe I'll leave it in the comments and then uh if you want to see the other video we'll have a link there and I just show it I don't even open it touch it lick it nothing and that's about it if you want to see other candy

it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the

strawberries [Music] guys I have to change things around so you're gonna see a glare on my glasses because I had to add a light it's getting darker faster than I thought so I've been drying these strawberries individually because I don't want to take any chances one strawberry dipped in the chocolate that is left wet can rule back to chocolate one of my tricks I saw this years ago I don't even remember where's when I stick toothpicks into all whenever we were in class working on chocolate sounds so professional he's doing this geez so the first few I'm gonna do are gonna be the white

"jLns_pzH_2o": "welcome to another episode of the gold TSP I'm Ashley and today we're gonna making homemade blueberry lollipops we're gonna be roasting some blueberries in the oven just intensify their flavor and let them release their sweet juices we're then gonna mix that into our lollipop base add a little bit of flavoring and pour them into freeform lollipops and here's how we're gonna make them we're first gonna make our flavoring for these lollipops so I have a hundred and seventy grams of blueberries 28 grams of granulated sugar one tablespoon of freshly squeezed orange juice and a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest and I put it into a little square pyrex dish you want something that has tall enough sides because we're gonna bake this and so we wanna be able to catch all those juices I'm just gonna stir this around we're gonna bake this in a preheated 375 degree oven just until all the blueberries burst I've just taken the blueberries out of the oven and they have been in there for about 35 minutes they are completely cooked down and the juices are oozing out of them we're gonna take this and carefully because this is still hot we're gonna put it into our blender we're now gonna whiz this up until it's a nice puree we're gonna get our blueberry puree out of our mixer and we will set this aside while we whip up our lollipops to make our lollipop base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already in my saucepan I measured it on my scale directly into the pan it's just because it's so sticky I don't want to waste any of it because you need to be really accurate when you are making candy I'm gonna go ahead and add 200 grams of granulated sugar 75 grams of water I'm gonna go ahead and put this on the stove over medium heat and we're gonna cook this until it reaches 315 degrees while our sugar mixture is on the stove we're gonna prepare our candy making station I have a towel to set the pot on as soon as it comes off the stove I have 20 grams of our roasted blueberries already ready to go in a container I also have one container of blueberry flavoring this is one DRAM I have a spatula because what's gonna happen is we're going to take it off the stove put it on to our towel we're gonna add both of our flavorings and mix it we're then going to pour it into a heatproof jug and then I have two trays I think I might just use one but just in case I need a second one and I have a Silpat mat on mine but you can use parchment paper and set if you like and the reason I'm using my macaron one is because it has circles already on it and it's about the diameter of the lollipop that I want to make we're gonna be making about one and a half inch lollipops I also have my sticks which are four inches ready to go in a little cup on standby once the sugar comes to temperature this is going to happen really fast that way when it's ready to go we can just assemble [Music] we're just gonna set these aside to cool probably for about an hour before taking them off the Mount and enjoying them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I hope you guys enjoy my blueberry lollipop give me ideas for any flavors or any other candies you'd like to see me make please leave me a comment down below and I'll do my best to make it happen if you haven't yet subscribe hit that button now and like the video if you did I'll see you

make chocolate covered strawberries for Valentine's Day or for any occasion and I have already pre-washed our strawberries so they are nice and washed and when you're washing you always want to make sure you go under the Leafs cuz you can always find like some dead leaves in there and you don't want none of that so always make sure you rinse them well and you Pat them dry so mines are already dry as well and what I'm gonna be using to transfer them to the refrigerator for a little bit is just have a little bit of parchment paper with the sheet pan alright so let's start so what I like using actually is a toothpick so go ahead and say your toothpick any not directly in that little like center right there but just like to the side and you're gonna want to hold it like this I feel like this method works out for me better you can get all the way to the top cuz I don't like seeing strawberries like half way up here I just it doesn't look really nice to me but its preference to you and so yeah that's how we're gonna dip it in and you never want to get toothpicks like this because that little piece right there it can go into your strawberry then you're gonna be like in a whole heart trouble so always toss that away always double-check all righty now that our strawberries are all done with the toothpick we're gonna start dipping and you always want to make sure that your chocolate is not hot like you want it to just be like warm all right let's start dipping so again grab it by the stems and you just want to go side to side you just want to shake off the excess you you all right so we're all done zipping all the strawberries so now I'm just going to clean up a little bit and I'll be right back all right so while the chocolate-covered strawberries are in the refrigerator we're going to start on decoration I mean you can do many types of different decoration but what I like doing is in pretzels and dipping them in chocolate and covering it half and then drizzling it with some chocolate so we're gonna go ahead and do that and I'm gonna show you so all you do is you grab your chocolate you grab your pencil right in half pull it out shake off the excess and then you just grab a toothpick you pierce the middle that's it and place it on your parchment paper you all right so let's start with the drizzling so what I like using your decorating bags but you can also use parchment paper and just like put them into little cones I can show you this a video later on if you guys want to see that please let me know down in the comments just let the chocolate in your decorating bag and you're all set you want to make sure your chocolate is still pretty is still runny you don't want it hardening up or anything cuz in little talking up in the bag you always want to make sure you place a piece of parchment paper on the bottom so that when you drizzle you can easily just toss this away or you can also do it on your countertop you get the option up to you it's just a little bit more to deal with but I me to do is if you drizzle you know you have a huge mess you just scrape it off you just go ahead and toss it away I mean either or you can do you can do either all right so I'm just gonna go out the easier to route and use the parchment paper placing your chocolate in the decorating bag you can place it in a cup so that it's a little bit more easier for you or I can just cup it over your hand up to you really alright so just go ahead and add in your chocolate gonna add a little bit you don't need that much alright so I'm gonna start off go ahead you don't want to add the red in your back just yet just because it is gonna take a little bit of time like type it on then so just in case your rep hardens you don't want that so just wait time you got that in go ahead and cut off a tiny tip okay so this hole is way too small you can tell that because it's like doing this little ribboning at the bottom and it's just this is too small all right so I'm just gonna go ahead and drizzle on this one so when you're piping out the chocolate you just want to go ahead and squeeze move your hand move your wrist and there you go you all right so now to the next up regular to the white ones and these white ones are gonna be drizzled with white and I'm gonna add in rose gold diamond dust alright so same thing we're going to do the lit with the light so we're gonna want to work quick on this one so go ahead and drizzle and we're gonna at the disco dust shake off the excess go on to the next one drizzle and we can always reuse the glitter that's why I added a part to the deeper on there so it does not go to waste because it is pretty expensive you so we're back with these and these are all drying so what you're gonna want to do is you don't want to take a little brush like this I found it on Amazon it was in a pack of like six I believe but all you want to do is grab that little brush and go in between the layers of the drizzling just want to be careful and that's pretty much it see if I can close up just like luck you can always find different colors of glitter I mean there's so many options out there you just got to be creative to your own thing this is super nice for Valentine's Day whether you're selling them we're just making it as a gift for your boyfriend your parents I mean you can give these strawberries to anyone and I feel like they're just gonna appreciate like all the detail you put into it because I mean look at these berries they're so glam they're really nice I mean you don't gotta go so into detail and take off like every single thing but like just take off what you can and you also got to keep in mind glitter gets everywhere so be careful be careful because it is a pain to pick up there you go you all right guys so all the strawberries are all dusted off look at how gorgeous they are they're so pretty all right so here's another tip put your strawberries off to the side always make sure since this is clean always all right so we don't waste none of this because this is all usable again just go ahead and you can even like use your brush bringing down get as much as you can it's person all right so that I will see for another day all right and so for the pretzels all I did is I just went ahead and drizzled them in a white and I just had a great idea so I'm gonna go ahead and grab the edible dust and I'm just gonna put them on there put something dust on there I'll bring one up see it's been so close you can see that it's the key touch it's super cute okay so for the red one I'm gonna add the red one with the white drizzle yeah all I'm gonna do to stick that on with a toothpick just put a little bit of white chocolate on there you at the white to one of these white drizzle clothes make sure it's centered you and you can go ahead and grab the glitter you can add a little bit more alright and there you go those are all set to give up the piece off to the side so I think I'm gonna use these white paper liners right and there you go guys that is the box I'm gonna set these off alright guys so we're all done this is what the box looks like it's gorgeous it's so pretty I mean everything down to the detail like look at that it's lovely and I would not put the tap over there I mean it's optional you can but like it's not gonna go all the way down unless you put that little like super shred like more towards the bottom you can definitely close it but I will just set it up like this you know just give it to them as a gift um put a cute little bow right here on the side on either side um this makes a great Valentine's gift for your loved one for your family member for a friend have fun be creative so yeah if you have any questions feel free to call me you know send me a picture on Instagram if you end up making this for Valentine's Day I'd love to see your pictures thank you so much for watching", "cetMLQ27EJ4": "one bad guy trying Papa and vitamin C pops [Music]

description place a medium sized pot to the top of your stove and turn your temperature on to a medium heat now pour a half cup of red wine into your pot go ahead and set a timer for 10 minutes and cook that wine so it reduces down for about 10 minutes after 10 minutes add 3/4 cup of sugar and add a pinch of sea salt last ingredient needed just add 4 tablespoons of light corn syrup now go ahead and just give it a mix around until it's fully mixed together and there's no clumps of sugar now pull your spoon out because you do not want to mix it anymore after it's mixed and place a candy thermometer into your pot and still let that cook on a medium heat you do not want or not to need at all and let it cook to a temperature of 275 degrees keep an eye on it because it does cook really fast [Music] after it reaches the temperature of 275 degrees on to a silicone pad or parchment paper start pouring it into a slow steady stream so it resembles a circle and they look like a lollipop shape after you pour like about a few circles place your lollipop stick into the candy and start twisting it so that way both sides get coated so that lollipop stick gets stuck in there and it will stay awesome and if you also want pour a little bit of the candy right on top of the lollipop stick so that way definitely definitely coated [Music] now go ahead and place your cookie sheet tray into the fridge for about 10 minutes and then after 10 minutes they should be completely ready to pull right off you can plate it up however you want but they look beautiful and amazing and they taste just like wine a super awesome way to decorate is grab your lollipops and push them into a styrofoam cone just because it looks super cool and if you have a party to which into an adult one of course these

"fOOHPRSEuko": "hey there my name's amanda and i'm sheri and we are the mother daughter designers at grace monroe home where we help you transform the ordinary home into an extraordinary home yes and today we have got a fun project for you we do we are going to be making some yarn lollipops these are so cute they would be really cute on a christmas tree in wreaths and just in any kind of candy themed decor for christmas yes you could even just put them in a vase put several of them in a little vase and have them on a side table or something they'd be so cute yes i think these are so adorable so let's go ahead and tell you what we're working with today to make these lollipops you will need two different um colors of really chunky yarn so this is uh some yarn that i got from hobby lobby and we've got a few different colors that we're going to be using today you also need these discs they're foam circle discs from the dollar tree yep and they come two in a pack yeah and you're going to need a pair of scissors then you're going to need something to use for the stick now what we have chosen to use for our lollipop stick are just straws decorative straws that you can get from walmart they may even have them at the dollar tree i'm not sure about that but these actually came from michael's that we're using today yes and they make it so festive and cute yeah you'll also need your glue gun yep got to have that and we're going to be making a couple of little bows to go on them so we've got some um just any kind of thin wired ribbon yes all right so let's go ahead and get started yes let's do the first thing we want to do is find the center of our disk so you can actually use a tape measure and find the exact center but i'm just going to eyeball it and just make a little mark with my scissors just a small little place so that i know that that's the center now you also want to go ahead and make your hole that your uh straw is going to go into so just use your scissors and just push it in and make you a hole just like that now we've got it ready so we're going to now use our glue gun and right where you marked in the center just put a dot of your glue and we're just gonna put these two down we've got them together we're just gonna put those down right on that dot of glue now just be careful you will burn yourself so be very careful well hopefully you don't yes hopefully not but if you need to just mash it down using your scissors just like that yeah but you can any time you're working with yeah you can certainly definitely okay now you want to go ahead with your glue and make a ring right around where your yarn is going to go so let's go right around there and we're just going to twist just like this we're going to just twist it right around you do want it to be right up next to the one so you've got to do it a little tightly but not too tight and if you see that you don't have enough glue just go through like this and glue some more just like that we're just going to continue as we go around continue using our glue and we're just gonna continue to wrap it right around and the really great thing about these they don't have to be perfect no they don't you can do them any kind of color combination you could even use three colors if you wanted to but i like the two like this i'm just going to keep coming around and i just go back and make sure if i lift up on it and it's not glued then i just put a little glue right there because you do want it to hold so just go back and make sure that you've got it glued just like that and we're just going to continue on around and i kind of use my hand just to pat it down yes it'll take you know a little bit for that glue to dry but exactly kind of helps yes it does these are already turning out so aren't they cute and yes your yarn will get twisted a little bit but you just untwist it just like that and we're just going to continue using our glue to stick it and make sure that it's glued really well all around and you can kind of tell as you're doing it if there's a piece that's not glued it will kind of be up a little further so uh just go ahead and put a little glue right there now we're going on around i've got to get another glue stick okay i'm actually doing a candy thing for christmas oh yes i always do one in my dining area and kitchen so i'm excited to use these yes this year and you know you can spend a lot of money going just by trying and it does you know i get that you know it makes things quicker to buy things but it's not nearly as fun as making them yourself right not and this is a great project that you could do with the kids uh you could use actually elmer's glue to do this it's going to take drying time so it's going to be a you know longer process now when you get to the side you just want to continue on around you see how the side is and i'm still going to continue on around and make sure that i've got them together going up my side just like that because you do want to make sure it's all covered so we're just going to continue on around i'm running out of glue yeah a little bit there we go make sure i get my pink one glued really good on the side just like that whoops got in the glue okay and you're just going to keep going around make sure to get around the top because you don't want to leave a place around the top at all so you want to keep bringing them around just like that until see how the whole complete top is done now and we've got part of the side so now i'm just going to continue on the side adding my glue and actually one or two if you get two um things of the yarn it will make several of these yes it will if you get two rolls it'll make i don't know how many but a good bit yes it will and you could even you know if you've got get four rolls then you could make several different combinations and that would be so cute okay now i'm still just going on around and you see it's automatically coming towards the back as you come around so i'm just using my glue i'm going ahead and putting the glue on there make sure it's up around the the one in front of it just like that because you don't want a single space oops i gotta get some more glue too now the good thing about when you do use the white yarn like i'm using if you do have a little bit of a space it's not it's not going to show as much that's true and don't worry you see i did get some glue on my yarn don't worry about that you can cut that off and it's not even going to be noticeable you just want to make sure it's really good and tight all the way around okay now before i go any further i'm just going to go around and make sure i see a little spot right here that didn't get enough glue so i'm going to put a little glue there so that i don't have any places that it's not glued well okay now we're all the way around to the complete back and you she's way ahead of me look at there you are ahead i mean these really are very simple they are simple it's literally just wrapping it around and it is extremely easy but like i was saying about the kids just make sure that if you do uh do these with your kids or your grandkids that you use a different kind of glue because the hot glue is gonna you're going to get it on you yeah i would definitely either use a low temp what we're using is a high temp with this you can use either one yes so whatever you have on hand is fine but definitely if you're doing it with kids um yes i mean i'd stick with elmer's glue i think i would just maybe a project that i do with my kids yes you can certainly do that they would love it oh they would they would get a kick out of this they definitely would because i had shown them these yesterday when i finished one and both of them loved it yeah well they love lollipops yes and really i'm not even going for perfection here because they look so cute and they don't even have to be perfect no they don't they absolutely don't i'm just going to continue to go around until you get it completely covered so i'm gonna go ahead and put enough blue on the last part to get it finished okay once you get to the end i'm a little bit ahead of her you just want to cut that right off yep but you see how simple and adorable this is now that i've gotten to the center goodness how cute now these i'm just going to put another little dab of glue in there and i'm just going to put these right in the inside just like that okay now how adorable i've got it all over my fingers too cute yes aren't they adorable they don't even have the sticks out what guys would be so cute you could actually make these into ornaments oh yes and hat just clip some of the little you know um yes fishing line a little fishing line certainly make them ornaments for your tree wouldn't that be wouldn't that be so cute yes so they're cute like that but we're going to now make them into lollipops yep so i'm just going right now and just mashing again just to make sure that i've got it good all the way around mine is pretty secure yes and now i've got to find the hole that i made i found my hole yeah i'm not going to use that color yeah there's mine so let me go over here and get a stick and let's see now i lost it where was it i've got to find it again there it is yeah they're you just want to make sure you put that little hole first just because that styrofoam is pretty it is tough to get this through and that just kind of helps it and it's going to keep it really secure in there yes it will and i am having a time trying to find where it is you found it and then and then i lost it i should not have moved should i make another one yes i certainly can it doesn't matter that's exactly what i'm going to do i bet it's right down there i think so but somewhere yeah i thought it was but i can't find it but if you forget to make the hole or anything like that you can simply do it after you have made it just use your scissors again just like that and then put some glue around the end of it and that just kind of extra and just stick it straight in just like that is that not adorable yeah and like i was saying that just kind of makes it extra secure because really i mean you could do it without even gluing it in there mine was in there pretty good yeah so really just kind of makes it extra secure it does now i said i was going to show you uh there were several places that i got a little bit of glue on my yarn just take like this and just kind of clip it off any of the glue try don't pull on it because if you pull it's going to unravel the the yarn so you don't want to pull on it but just kind of clip it off and i see i didn't get my end down in there good so let me go back and get my end in there these are so cute they really are and you see how easy they are it takes just a few minutes to do that but oh so easy and so adorable and if you wanted to there's a couple things you could do to kind of dress them up even more you could sprinkle some glitter on there if you wanted to you could spray some glitter um this diamond dust glitter blast i think would be so cute sprayed on it yes i'm not going to spray it right now just because we're not in a well insulated area when you do it that you are in a well-ventilated area you can just spray that just do it outside spread do a couple sprays on there it's just going to give it that nice little glitter yes because we love glitter and bling yes got to have that got to have it so but see and now we want to put a little bow on these and you could use you know any color that you wanted to anything like that uh or you could not have a bow right so we'll leave one without and we'll add you know you can just do the different ways you can do it yes you could just tie it right around that way do you see the wire the floral wire over there what i'm going to do is i'm just going to uh get a piece of floral wire now um you could use pipe cleaners or anything like that uh but i'm just going to make a quick little bow by making a loop you don't want a big one so we're just going to do a little loop like that i'm just going to make my loop i'll leave the place right there and then i'm just going to twist my ribbon around and make another loop just make sure they're about even just like that and then i'm just going to cut these off and i'm just gonna take my wire you could use anything that you've got a pipe cleaner uh anything like that would work but i'm just twisting it around the center and i've got a cute little bow and then i'm what i'm you could actually wire it here just like this to the back but what i'm going to do i've twisted it several times so it's not going to come loose so i'm just going to cut the wire off just like that and i want to dovetail these ends to make them pretty so to do that i just fold them over in the center and take my scissors at the corner and cut upward and i'm going to do the same thing here fold it in half and here where the corner is i'm going to take my scissors and go upward just like that and that makes those cute little dovetails and then i'm just going to put a little dot of glue right there and dot it like that and now we've got our cute little bow see how sweet those are so you can as you can see different ribbon you can use or you don't have to use yes you wouldn't even have to use anything if you didn't want to because they are just as cute without but you could do any kind of ribbon uh something if you wanted to match your tree or anything like that so how cute are these so cute i'm in love with these i can't wait to make some more of these and use them this christmas yes they are so precious and you can use like we said any color combination but y'all just have fun with

ones like in the stores and this is from Bruce you too biggest the best tasting sometimes it didn't go together you know it's also a matter of opinion biggest and best I can tell you what there you know in the stores they've got Chandler they've got Douglas they got Pajaro they have sweet Charlie's the commercial growers kind of that's what they're growing and and they're growing them as an annual crop and I'm not sure how well they would work on a matted row system if you have a matted row system in your garden where you're treating them as a perennial or not but an old standby in the state of Tennessee for years and years and I'm not sure where Bruce is from yes Cardinal Cardinal has a real good tasting strawberry and it's a big strawberry but you got to keep in mind you say yours are small and taste good get to the berries off the daughter plants are always smaller than the berries on the mother plant so if you maybe if you're you know matted row system if you would start growing these as an as an annual crop and get new ones every year and plant them every fall and harvest them in the spring and then indeed that's what the way the commercial growers do it then you might be small good tasting one that you have might be large good tasting ones dipping I don't know how old your your planning is but they get smaller and smaller as the strawberries get older it's good point all right but again we don't know where he is we don't know where he is right but we do know what you can the good varieties here anyway that's right yeah that's right you definitely know that and I and the Chandler Douglas Pajaro sweet Charlie's they grow from the Gulf Coast all the way up here I know all over the south eastern United States and even out in California I think they're

"lIOaYPbhjcc": "Valentine's comes so soon it seems like after Christmas I mean literally about the day after the Christmas decorations are taking down the store I think the Valentine's display are put up I know it all seems too soon to sudden everything comes too fast but I do love a reason to celebrate and you know what if it can be a little bit more of a homemade celebration I think all the better that's why I'm gonna help you make amazing homemade Valentines suckers this year what you're gonna make the suckers I know it's so easy to go to the store and just buy a bag of mom and give them out to people give them to your kids to take to their class but come on making my home is actually so fun and I think you're going to be surprised how easy this is because it really is easy but as a word of caution before we start working with sugar is dangerous you can actually burn yourself and I'm just gonna tell you now I've done it I am telling you from experience just the other week before Christmas I burned myself pretty bad on a batch of peanut brittle so you want to make sure to have a bowl of ice water by the stove ready to go plunge your hand into it if you get sugar on it so be careful and do not let the kids help do this because it can be a little scary but put that aside don't worry if you do it right you will not have a problem to start you just want to make sure to have everything ready to go you can buy these sucker molds at any craft supply store kitchen store they are extremely inexpensive and you can buy any shape you want since it's Valentine's I'm meeting some hearts but I also have just some regular round circles too just to add a little bit of difference and show you what you can do I like to put my molds on parchment lined baking sheet that way if you drizzle any of the sugar onto the counter or onto the sheet it just goes round to that parchment paper and it is really easy cleanup so before we start you just want to make sure to rub the insides of all these molds with vegetable oil once again from experience I've learned if you don't they don't really come out that nice and they don't look that nice so just lightly put a little bit of a paper towel and vegetable oil and rub the insides of the mold then you just want to put some sucker sticks which come from the craft supply store - they're usually right beside these molds so don't worry place them in with the mold and have it go about half way up into the sucker kind of just however much you want it to go up and then you are ready to go once your molds are ready to go you can just set them aside and leave them until you're ready next it's important to make sure everything is also ready to go so just have whatever flavoring you're going to use and we'll talk about that here in a little bit and your food coloring just set aside and ready for when it's needed because as you know in the past when you work with sugar once the sugars ready you need to be ready there is no time to just wait around part of making sure everything is ready I also like to have a glass heat proof measuring cup at least a two cup size ready to go to pour the sucker mixture in before you pour them into the molds if you try to write out a saucepan you were gonna have the stuff all over and you don't want that so just lightly oil the inside of this measuring cup so it comes out easier and cleanup is easier and then set that aside okay to start in a small saucepan you just want to put in some sugar yes these are suckers so of course they have sugar then you just want to put a little bit of water and some corn syrup now the corn syrup I like to take the measuring cup and just lightly rub it with oil too that way it will just come out a little bit easier you don't have to that is just a nice little tip that I love to do once all your ingredients are in that saucepan you just want to set it on the stove over medium to medium-high heat stir it just a little bit to make sure now the sugars sticking to the bottom and then once it is starting to get warm you can just turn it up to high yes remember I said this gets really hot so it turns up to high have that ice water beside you and be watching it it's going to come to a full boil and remember that a boil is about 212 degrees so once it starts boiling you know that it's about 212 degrees but we are taking this all the way up to hard crack which is about 300 degrees and that's quite a ways to go so once it starts boiling you just want to start watching it closely and then after a little while you want to start taking the temperature to see where it's at usually I find that once it starts boiling it stays around 225 to 230 for quite a while that temperature is usually where the water starting to boil off and evaporate and once that's done it really starts to climb so watch it carefully make sure to have your candy thermometer fitted on your saucepan if you're using a traditional candy thermometer I use an instant-read thermometer which I love but you may not all have one so use whatever you're used to once your temperature reaches 300 degrees turn off the stove and take the pan off right away this is where I said it's great to have everything ready to go you want to pour in your flavoring now you can use whatever flavoring you like I do a mix the traditional old recipe that my grandma used to make mushy made candy was just cinnamon candy which I know in today's modern times a lot of people don't love cinnamon candy I still kind of like it i no big surprise but you can also go the more modern route and do cherry I love to use whatever flavoring and usually these flavorings are right beside these candy molds in the aisle so you can just pick and choose right there and then put in your food coloring red obviously it's Valentine's Day and then stir that up it is going to bubble kind of vigorously at first so be careful and then pour it right into your prepared measuring cup you do want to work rather quickly because sugar does harden fairly fast so once it's near majoring cups start pouring it into your molds I like to pour it directly over that stick that's going to be in the middle of the sucker that way you make sure that's coated completely and if it starts to bubble quite a bit in your molds just move on to the next one and then you may have to go back and fill them back up if they weren't all the way full as you can tell as I keep going along it gets a lot thicker because it is cooling down so it is becoming harder don't worry you just have to work as quick as you can but don't rush yourself you could always make more you don't want to get in a hurry and either burn yourself or make a huge mess once you have all of it out of there and in your molds you just want to set the mold aside in a little bit cooler place until they harden completely that's all there is to it I told you this was easy once they are hard they just pop right out of the mold because we oiled them make sure you all them or they are not gonna pop right out they're gonna break out and then no one's happy with that once you take my out of the mold you can put them right into one of these nice little cellophane bags they're clear they look perfect on these suckers then they won't stick together either and then just twist them off with a little twist tie I mean these are so fun because you made them it is so much more meaningful and you can tailor them to whatever flavor you love so this Valentine's I hope you make your own sucker candy because they are absolutely delicious fun and easy

is chloe cooker bears and you guys are the bears make sure to subscribe turn on post notifications and give this video a thumbs up in the comments down below give me some video ideas i know in the last video my comments were turned off but i am working on that to get them turned on so you guys can give me some video ideas and put some feed in there so let's just get started let's go today i'm doing something a little different i'm going to be making some candy strawberries they're kind of like when in the asmr videos i will be doing a little bit of a smart and so stay tuned for that um i'm also these are also from the fair like the candy apples that you see there so this is kind of like a replica but with strawberries um so let's just get started so we are going to cut off the stems um i am preparing four on each um skewer stick um so that is what you'll be needing um one of the things that you'll be needing to make uh candy strawberries um so yeah i'm just cutting some right now so i'm using this knife it does not have to be this big does not have to be like this you also need to ask your parent or your garderian to make this you need to have them watch you while you cut stuff too unless you're using a butter knife um so this is how you cut with it's just really easy and simple cutting with a butter knife really using this bigger knife i feel like it cuts faster and it also works better carrying sticks i found these in the craft section in walmart they're fairly cheap i found these for about 78 cents um so what you do is you just put your first one on like so i'm going to save one of the bigger ones for the last one and i'll show you how to put on the last one so it doesn't fall sorry i'm trying to get this on and then you're just going to put the last one you're going to put these a little close and just put the last one half on so it doesn't like fall off and then it'll look something like this when you're done i'm going to cut four more up and put it on my last curing stick and then i'll show you how to make the rock cake i said this is a cooking video so ask your parents for help or um have them stand by you while you do this so you're going to need half a cup of water into the pot you're going to need a cup of brown sugar and you're also going to need a tablespoon of honey just throw this in just to make it taste a little better sweeter put this in the side now we're just gonna mix we're gonna bring it to a boil and you need to keep on stirring profusely until it gets to the boil because um it'll start it'll harden if you don't keep on stirring i'm going to admire my dog bella and joseph about 15 to 20 minutes of boiling this is what it should look like and now let's do the chopstick test like i told you guys so we're going to take our chopstick we're going to swirl it around in this looking something like this going to put it in your water for about um one minute or it should look something like this and that's what you know your strawberry paste is ready generously put it on i drop mine in there to really just like soak it on and then i take this and i put it on my parchment paper i forgot to tell you that you guys are also going to need some parchment paper look at how good that looks take your spoon and you're going to mix it and then you're going to turn it and start putting some on top the candy melt should look like once it is done hardening and dried and this is what it should sound like oh my god that is so good and delicious i hope you guys really enjoyed this video you get to eat your creation that you

show you how to put together these spider-man faces Oreo cookie pops alright guys here are the things you're going to need you need a candy melter some red candy melts so mega or double stuffed Oreo cookies something to hold your lollipop sticks on some lollipop sticks ascribe to an offset spatula and I'll show you what you will need for that later on and some black and white were icing alright guys we have a lot to do so let's get started alright guys the first thing that you will need to do is get cookie a little bit to insert your stick and then we're going to set that down to dry or you can set it on your phone there so I have here one that's already dried up just beat up candy I like to spin it putting two fingers and the thumb and with the other hand spinning there like a machine like a washing machine and spin mode I just spin it around like this and it released it's a lot of the candy that way it only gives it a nice coat sort of like if your crumb coating a cake you're gonna crumb coat your your Oreo cookie that's just to cover some of it I'm gonna come back and fill in these gaps there that's what I'm gonna use my offset spatula for I don't like that a little channel there the gap in there so I'm just going to fill that in so it'll be nice and smooth and so we're going to set this aside and I let it dry and I have here one that's already dried you see there I'm like I don't like that gap there I want it nice and full like here so I'd like to call some of the candy and then just you can use that a knife or anything something flat like this to sit in your candy and fill in those gaps that's just to make it look nice and smooth and not so sloppy don't worry about this here it'll dry up and then when we give it a second coat because we will give give this a second coat just smooths everything out that way we don't speed all the detail of the cooking in the logo the Oreo label in there so no this is fine and we're going to grab one that's already been dried oh here's so this is what I like then it's covered up so it's nice and smooth on my other video for the venom cake oreo cookies pop I mentioned that it looks like a hockey puck so it's it's it's black so it's nice and solid so when you dip it again it'll be nice and solve it and not lumpy or like it looks really sloppy I don't really like that it looks really sloppy so just drain the candy of course you can do this to all your cookies one at a time make sure you let that can be set before you move on to the next step okay relieve some of that candy it's alright we can just let this set it'll take a few minutes make sure that it completely completely that's here's one that's already been tried so we're going to go ahead and draw the eyes on this one we're gonna do something like okay so we're going to start with the I am I getting the position here what I'm doing they're going to bring me down you fill it in and then with your tool we can either expand it we're doing - fixing up touching up that you need this is basically like I can assure a cookie but it's really really efficient to me and I think using royal icing is the best way to go see how quickly that was but I've been doing quite a few of them so I just gotta practice but it's very very easy it's kind of like doing a deed but like a little bit I'm long gated from the top there and when we're done Cana so we're going to with the black icing do the outline like I've done here that's very easy on this do is just trace but edge of that white I seem that you already did you are make sure that your white icing is pretty much dry before you do this or else that that wet moist white icing will will want to suck up some of this moisture from the black now we're done with that now we're going to start doing the wedding make sure that you give the black outlines outline some time to dry that way if you happen to touch your outline with the outline that you're making for the web it doesn't join in and distort your outline you Hey so you will continue doing that fill out the whole cookie just making about three to four lines of these arches until you reach the very smaller ones in the center and then you'll continue you alright guys I will give you these a couple hours to dry if you can leave them overnight that would be ideal that way you are for certain that you won't damage these while packaging them now I use about three by four I believe these are the smallest cellophane bags that they have you can find them at the craft store in the baking aisle I wanted to share another spider-man cookie pop with you guys if you're interested I will load that up and I think that is home I will let you go now thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I will talk

with it all right um the guy said that you have to like mix it around we're gonna get a spoon and mix it in just a couple of minutes we're gonna let it kind of melts a little bit it's already starting to melt even they can't tell Wow all right go ahead stir Oh golly I melted chocolate down there yeah yep oh it's her she syrup would that you'd like make chocolate oh god this is probably how they do it all do it like big furnaces or something look this guy it's like making or decock and melt I know she won't come alright so y'all just keep stirring and at all if the water cools down too much we might have to pour some more hot water in but keep stirring around and see if you can melt it up good we need a paper towel to Center spoons down line because we never know it's like Hershey's chocolate setup bunched up into like little nuggets now again I kind of roll it around trying to get your fingers off look remember the pot is still hot so be careful that pot all right and then lift it up and then let it let it kind of drip off so you don't get too much chocolate all right hang on one second all right and then set it on our pan so be careful cuz if you know there you go it's okay it's okay we can just spit them off all right Eli we'll see you do yours can I try can I don't lick your fingers yet cuz we gotta make more if you if you're pulling too much on the green part it'll break off so you may have to hold it by the top of the strawberry what alright and drift it let it drip some we'll try to keep them we may be able to tell which ones which cuz they may dry one may drive darker than that okay alright and then put yours on the pan good you worried the one with the super super different long leaves good chocolate on them you may have to hold the top of us enough will cuz you don't want to rip all the green part cuz that's part of what's pretty about it like oh boy trust it let it drip on the pan I couldn't because the green ones that's starting to break up

What a great pun.", "T3xgRZfAEak": "how to make sea salt caramel lollipops [Music] hello everyone starting off with a medium-sized saucepan and in the saucepan you'll place one cup of white granulated sugar activat 2 tablespoons or an ounce of water a teaspoon of lemon juice a teaspoon of sea salt and a quarter cup of white or light colored corn syrup the addition of the corn syrup will help keep it from crystallizing too quickly and will make mixture smoother now stir this together over medium-high heat until it starts to boil once this starts the ball you're gonna add in 1/4 cup or four tablespoons of butter a little bit at a time so what I did is I took some cold butter cut it into cubes and then I'm just adding one one or two cubes at a time and stirring until the butter is melted and I continue to add the butter until it was completely combined in there and then you're gonna cook it on medium high boiling it until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack candy stage and be careful when it starts to change color that's when you know you're getting close to the correct temperature and if you start getting some scorching you may have to move it off the heat a little bit but chances are it'll coincide almost exactly when it starts to get the caramel color as the time it'll be at the right temperature once it gets to be the right temperature take it off the heat and stir in a teaspoon of vanilla extract now you're gonna spoon your hot caramel mixture into some candy molds these are special molds just for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that use for chocolate molding because they'll just melt they'll lose their shape make sure you get the hard candy ones I actually found mine online so just to Google hard candy mold you probably get quite a few buying options if you can't get them at your local hobby store i greased these molds very lightly with a little bit of cooking spray prior to filling them in I put in the candy sticks and when you're filling the mold make sure that you cover the stick with caramel so that it's nicely put together I did some heart molds I did these happy face molds these ones are probably a little bit too big for caramel cuz the caramel is a little it takes a little long time to eat compared to regular hard candy I get some little round ones which I think are the perfect size for this type of candy let them Harden and then don't pull them up by the sticks flex the mold a little bit and if they should just pop out quite nicely now if you like and I recommend it sprinkle on it's just a little bit more sea salt on top of the lollipops when they're done that salt will stick to them and you will have a really nice treat sweet and salty together is a amazing flavor and these are absolutely delicious they taste a lot like the Werther's original caramel candies if you've ever had those now store these in between layers of plastic wrap and make sure that you lay them flat I found that you stand them up oh after 2 or 3 days especially the large ones like these happy face ones they will start to droop over a little bit because all the caramel is hard it's not super hard and will Bend with gravity over a couple of days but I doubt that these will last this long because they're really good I hope you give them a try now if you don't have a hard candy mold or don't want to buy them or don't have the money to buy them there is another way and I've made lollipops without a mold in the past so here's the video on your screen right now if you want to go take a look this would work with the caramels as well but the finish on your candy may not accept that extra little sprinkle of salt after because of the cornstarch go and check this out if you're interested thanks

stuff I had their Dr Pepper video afloat I've also done a couple of others so we are here with the tuber tubes I love these lollies when I was a kid absolutely love them and if this tastes anything like the strawberry lolly is from tributo strawberries and cream I think he was yes Robby's include it'll be worth the one-pound 49 okay so here he goes man I wish you could smell that it's like it looks like a cream soda on the inside but it smells just like story and cream to put your body's Japanese if it tastes and we're gonna love them forever so he goes to the taste cheese I am now a very happy man that store he feels like I'm sucking on a lollipop it's amazing they've captured the flavor of that strawberries and cream to a tee one pound 49 is expensive for Panasonic colour-pop whatever you wanna call it but it's really really the lovely something probably about twenty pounds three pence now I've been here about five feet when I was a kid but for one path to keep saving one powerful you know more powerful but the taste is amazing that is such and even the Sun was coming out now just to brighten my day sparkling Kabutops strawberry and cream flavor yes taste rating gets a 10/10 when Rob because that is just like the lollipops that nailed it absolutely massively smash that can now that's beautiful absolutely banging so that was my review of Japanese Chupa Chups

no high fructose corn syrup made in a peanut-free facility made with no soy no egg and no dairy eight flavors it says nutrition facts are serving size is three pops and I'm trying out for all eight of so I'm getting more than two serving sizes in this oh boy how to be fun haha the seven per container is about thirteen and I really feel like there's a lot more than 13 in here to be honest I feel like there's like thirty maybe okay the amount per serving is 60 calories zero fat zero total fat zero saturated fat zero trans fat zero cholesterol five milligrams of sodium sixteen grams of total carbohydrates zero dietary fiber 12 sugars zero protein I don't think these are really cute friendly I'm about to go over my carbs for the day just trying this out for y'all this is only 20 calories per pop okay there's only 20 calories in this I feel like this is a little bit little 420 calories but I'm going to try every single for y'all it's gonna randomly grab them and try them but I am gonna be trying every single flavor it says this package material has been manufactured in a factory designed and built sleep cynical building guidelines on an equipment powered by 100% wind generated electrical energy which may not have it if the machine is made on is powered by electrical energy okay so the very first one I'm going to try that I just random to grab is perfectly peach I love peach flavored stuff like slight baked peach flavored stuff so hopefully this is good it's pretty it's got like two colors in it it's little it's round it looks like a caramel pop but it's peach it's got like this like two different caramel colors one's like a caramel brown and there's like a car mode dark brown but it's peach flavor try yep fake peach plant flavor I really like this this is if you like pate if you like baked peach flavor you will enjoy this very much Feli can you chew it do social ease permit it's kind of hydrating actually but it does stick to your teeth in that cavity filling type way where it's just like sticky sugar is attached to your teeth I mean it's candy either way whether it's organic or not it's still candy so it's so going to stick to your teeth so if you have issues without I wouldn't recommend these okay the next lever I'm gonna try is strawberry smash and this one is also kind of like two different shades of red what whoa what hold on guys what guys this doesn't taste like plate fake strawberry this tastes like actual strawberry like real strawberry flavor what yeah guy that guys that is a real strawberry flavor right there's not that is not a fake strawberry flavor that fake strawberry flavor like really gives me a headache this is this is like true strawberry flavor what again like a hydrating pool filter because it feels like I'm sorry guys it's like sour like a natural strawberry mmm definitely got that pack that pucker padge to it it's not super sour but it's not fake short way it's like pucker is like an actual strawberry it's really good it does have that hydrating feel to it and the teeth sticking gum I really like that I don't like fake strawberry but I really do like that ok the next one we're going to try is pomegranate a pucker speaking the pucker [Music] and this is like a dark red maroon color I really don't know what pomegranate tastes like I have not had it in like many decades but I'll be honest guys this kind of tastes like a cough drop laughs enjoy this tastes like a loss injure like a lost engineer without all the medicine inside it honestly I don't know what Paul McGann tase is supposed to taste like but if the other toothpaste was like they were supposed to I imagine this is I don't know how I'll contain is supposed to taste like Tomica pomegranate but it's good though it's good it just tastes like that outer hard candy of a loss injure yeah I really don't know what a pom aren't supposed to taste like but it has a hijacking feeling it has that stickiness to the teeth and it's got a pucker tight feel to her let's try very very cherry I love Martian on cherries but I've never had a candy that actually tastes like one let's see if this has that fake cherry taste to it yep tastes like a look at your lollipop it has that fake cherry taste to it like I'm you know like I'm on Valentine's Day you get those like really huge heart-shaped lollipops and you really know what flavor they are I imagine cherry because that's what this tastes like it's good though I but I like cherry flavor it's not fake or real so I should have borne more it starts the taste like by cherry and I like black cherry more than regular cherry I really like that but I'm biased because I really like cherry flavored things but to me that was delicious we four down four more to go oh my gosh let's do razzmatazz berry and I have no idea what that means but I'm assuming raspberry because there's raspberries all over the picture and that's the only thing that's on there is raspberries and it's red so I'm guessing it's raspberry flavored I think I've ever had fake raspberry they were I've only had blue raspberry flavor or mixed berry remember just had raspberry we'll see my teeth kind of heard guys has a lot of sugar three months ago this would have been nothing to me but I don't really consume sugar now that I'm on keto and Wow the yeah my teeth actually feel really heavy would not recommend eating all eight Kent all eight flavors in one sitting and if I was not doing the video for you I would not be doing this I I don't even like all these flavours to be honest okay let's try raspberry huh I guess I don't know what fake raspberries supposed to taste like because I don't taste anything let me bite into it and see if that does something cuz sucking on it I don't taste anything but I don't know what raspberry supposed to taste like only blue raspberry pepper and it's definitely got a pucker to it Wow hmm yes super pucker issue out that it was very sour hmm I'm gonna say sorry but it's very peppery it tastes like the poem I got one too I'm being completely honest um yeah that just is that the pomegranate Ameen hmm and again I don't know what Paul McGrath supposed to taste like so pomegranate and raspberry know what they're supposed to taste like but they say so same to me I may have a very big pucker to them whoa three more to go let's try one that I really am looking forward to I am love watermelon flavored things so I have high hopes for this one you would think that it would be green but it's not it's like a red and then like a reddish white pink a pink color I really thought it was gonna be green yeah definitely that really fake sugary watermelon flavored delicious I love fake watermelon it's really good to me yeah definitely yeah I really like that I really like that a lot mm-hmm Jim Monica we're gonna try the mango tango we don't really know what mingles supposed to taste like guys but I think I like it it's like half orange half yellow which I imagine this the color of a mango um there's mingos supposed to taste like orange like actual orange guys because that's what this tastes like tastes like an orange candy to me okay I think I know what the Mango Tango means okay guys I think that I know why there's two different colors this orange color is orange flavored and this yellow color is mango flavored so this is like an orange mango type flavor Wow mm-hmm and it definitely has that like fake orange soda type flavor to it it's really good I like this I like this a lot yeah I was definitely a flavor of orange and a flavour of something I've never had which I'm assuming is probably mango and if that's fake Meena then yeah fake mangoes actually pretty good and I saved at my least favorite for last I absolutely actually I cannot sense fake star berry and I can't stand fake great so I'm really glad that tasted like real strawberry considering this is completely purple I think this is gonna be fake gratefully right and I really really really do not like fake great flavor but I'm going to do this for you yeah it's most like grape kool-aid or something that I just really don't want to put in my mouth I'm so glad this is the last one oh my gosh ice I just ate sugar for 23 minutes straight oh my god yup fake grape flavor if you like baked grape flavor spot-on you will love this if you are like me and do not like fake grape flavor you will check this in the Josh this is not berry but I'm going to find someone and give all the grapes because I really don't like this big I honestly do not like this fake great type flavor but it sort of tastes like it tastes like what it's supposed to you bite into it it just really tastes like grape kool-aid yeah I would say a lot of these head pucker to him if not all I think all had pucker to them anyways I hope you enjoyed watching me eat sugar for 25 minutes straight because I did not enjoy that anyways guys if y'all want to give these a try these are the young earth organic pops they are actually pretty good I like them I just want to recommend eating eight in a row there's just no I don't know where you would get these because I got on from stock market and I don't know if they are made by five market specifically or if you can just get the or like I don't know if yummy earth is the part that makes them yeah I think it's yum right because it says your mouth calm so I guess there's a part of could call yum yum yum earth but again I got this from Thai market so anyways yeah I hope y'all just enjoyed meeting all that sugar and I hope you have a great day bye",

make some chocolate lollipops decorated for the Christmas season well going to begin with merkins cocoa light cocoa dark and white chocolate you can use any color of chocolate or any chocolate coating that you care to use this is a delicious product that is very easy to make candies with now I've already melted some of the cocoa dark and in order to melt this chocolate all you do is you dump the wafers in a microwavable bowl and put them in the microwave at 50% power never more than half power start with one or two minutes and then take them out and just stir them and when you only see a few lumps left that's when you want to stop microwaving it and just stir it until it's completely melted and it's fluid and then you'll know that you're ready to go I have my chocolate mold and in this case I'm using a very simple lollipop mold I've made sure that I've used a soft towel this is like a flowers flower sack towel or at least a linen towel that will not have any dust particles on it and then you want to buff the inside of these molds and that will help give them a really nice shine so we'll just buff those make sure that they're clean and they're well buffed and you're ready to go you'll need some lollipop sticks and these are the I think these are the four and a half inch sticks ready to go yes and follow all we do now is add the chocolate right into the mold try not to overfill them it's better to add a little more after than to try to take chocolate out of the mold and I'm gonna do four of these and one more there we go now to get the air bubbles out you simply drop them on a table and you can see how that filled very very quickly it didn't look like I had a chalk a lot of chocolate in the mold but once you once you drop them and they level out you can see which ones clearly need just a little bit more but it's a lot easier to add it than to have it go over the edge okay after I've dropped it a couple times and I know that the air bubbles are out take the lollipop stick drop it in and then turn it and that completely inroads the lollipop stick into the chocolate and it secures it in there okay I'm done from here I'm gonna put these into the freezer they'll take about five to ten minutes to chill and you'll know they're ready when you feel the back of them when you put your finger on the back and it feels cold you're know they're ready to come out now I've already made some ahead I'm gonna put these in the freezer and bring the other ones up and I'm gonna unload those for you we just did here's the white one and it's cold on the back and you can see how easily they pop out and again they pop right out so now we're just going to put a simple decoration on these and to decorate these today I'm going to use some of the royal icing decorations that we sell at global sugar art and these are ready to use decorations and we have reindeer trees snowman Holly poinsettias there are many many other ones that we carry as well so to add one of these royal decker royal icing decorations onto the chocolate I'm just dipping a paintbrush in a little bit of chocolate I'm going to put a little dab on the lollipop and then just stick that on and I know that didn't stick because the chocolate is cold and it hardened very quickly there we go so if I want to make sure that it doesn't show I'll put it on the back of the of the royal icing decoration let's see what else we can do a little you can see how quick and easy these are this is a great project to do with children or other family members or as a holiday gathering and of course I think we already got Santa well we've done most of them then and we'll do the last one there we go okay so just to repeat the process I melted the chocolate I melted the merkins chocolate in the microwave at half power for it took about a minute to three minutes depending on how much you put in the bowl just scoop it into a buff mole put the drop it on the counter a couple times to get the air bubbles out then add your lollipop stick and turn it and then put them in the freezer for about five to ten minutes when they're done you just pop them out and you can add the decorations the royal icing decorations with a little bit of melted chocolate and then to package these I'm just going to use a clear bag that we sell these are candy makers bags and you just pop that in there and then you can use any sort of a little tie if you want to use a little ribbon of Christmas ribbon these are a great stocking stuffer or even a little placeholder at the Christmas table for a child or even a for adult like me who loves chocolate I would take it any day thanks for watching all the products are available at global sugar are calm and Happy Holidays thank you you", "cYKKlF0xVzw": "[Music] melodies we haven't played and this one right here we're also going to try this one I have not tried this one myself so this is gonna be the first time for me so we're gonna mold but it has the lollipop stick and for this one I thought it'd be great because I'm gonna show you guys later on in a different video how to make these bleep up sticks which are so cute but they fit perfectly in the cavity hole so definitely gonna try these up today and we'll see how they work out and I'll link all the product descriptions down below and where you got them now on to the cookies and all the ingredients tools and supplies so I got these regular Oreos I know they do have double stuff but for double-stuffed they are too big to fit into these molds right here so this one is just perfect the regular one and while I was browsing around looking at all the cookies I thought why don't I try kind of putting a different cookie inside and seeing how that tastes so I got the chips avoidances using my favorite ones too so I'm gonna try that out for you guys and I'll let you guys know how it tastes but if this one doesn't afford Keeney this can possibly put any kind of cookie you guys like inside of that mold we're also gonna need a spatula some Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers sprinkles of your choice I got these ones at Walmart and just some simple white pearls some standing trigger that I really like is from Wilton this one is the clear one and this one here what's the clear one as well but I added some gold luster dust to it so I just place the lesser distance side just a little bit because a little bit goes a long way and I just give this a shake so that's one is it that one and this one I got at t.j.maxx it has a whole bunch of different pastel sand sugars pop stick these ones have orange jewels at the dollar store you can get different colors for like a dollar I think the last time that I bought them it was like like 15 it's like about fifty of these for a dollar so definitely when I go out there again I'm gonna grab different colors but these I believe are the paper straws and these mini chocolate eggs they're gonna look so cute on there some piping bags so you put the chocolate inside some spatulas some parchment paper and for the Treat Bags I'm gonna use these clear ones but you can also use some that have to agree with designs on them as well I got these bulk from Daiso they don't have a Las Vegas where I'm from but I know that California does and I'm pretty sure some other states happen as well I'm not too sure um but these were only a dollar fifty book this one came with 35 and this one comes with 18 indeed they both come with some time so that's great very great price but I also found these at Baker's bodega and California these were a dollar for 450 of these mini little bags so you can find them anywhere you can even find them at Michaels you just gotta and one last thing that I didn't want to point out I'll show you guys how I got my chocolate but if you guys don't have these needs at home I've done this myself I have these silicone cupcake molds but this also worked great for me to make my child covered or as a person they need them so they're just made out of silicone so for these since they are rather happier they might even be a bigger so it might have more chocolate it still works the same way I'd say just don't fill it up all the way to the top because that is how much chocolate just fill it out about half the way and you'll be fine that'll work it'll be the same exactly so I have two different ones I got this one die so as well definitely do this if you do have it at home and you don't have this mold okay guys so this is the end of showing you all the tools and supplies so now we're gonna get right into the video I'm gonna movie as in closer so you can see everything that's going on I'm gonna explain everything as well as I can and thank you guys so much for all the support on all my videos you guys are amazing and also make sure to hit that subscribe button and that bell to notify you when I upload videos you guys may be really happy thank you so much for your comments alright let's get right into the video okay guys so let's start with melting our chocolate so I did get these at Dollar Tree if anyone's wondering this one is made out of plastic which is perfectly fine to place into the microwave because it says right on the bottoms so we're just gonna fill this up I'm gonna fill it up kind of all the way up and I know you guys have been asking me you know how it comes out so smooth but this chocolate sauce it just melts so easily you don't really need to add anything okay so I filled this up to the top I'm gonna place this into the microwave for 30 second intervals okay so after 30 seconds the cup is not warm on the milk chocolate I can't see that it's melted yet so we're gonna keep on adding 30 seconds until we see a change okay so this is after another 30 seconds of leaving it in there so total one minute the chocolate is still not melting in there it's pretty warm it's getting warmer so I'm gonna place it in there for 30 seconds more okay so this is already another 30 seconds so total one minute and 30 seconds so far and definitely the chocolate is melting already but the cup is not hot um so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna sir and as you guys can see you know it's getting melted so it's not quite there yet but I'm gonna end up adding more chocolate because this will not be enough so another 30 seconds okay so I have not stirred this one but you can see it's melting so in total this has been melted for two minutes already I could use this home right now but I'm gonna add in some more chocolate in there just so I have more to work with as opposed to a melting more later on I can just do it all right now all right more chocolate and let me know in the description down below what kind of chocolate do you guys like using so I could try to experiment with different kinds of chocolate because this one is my ultimate favorite just because it melts so easily and it tastes so good because it's a Ghirardelli chocolate that's chocolate so let me know so once I added more of these candy melts just gonna push it down to the bottom and I'm gonna add in 30 more seconds okay so total this is 2 minutes and 30 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and mix it again and also we won't be using candy coloring to color this so I'll let you guys know what kind of candy coloring I like using from what brand okay this is going in for 30 seconds more okay so total this has been in the microwave for 3 minutes already so I'm gonna give that a stir and I'm gonna see if all of the chocolate has melted so there's still some chunks in there and the cup is getting warmer so it's a little hotter than before I feel like I can leave this at room temperature for a little bit so I don't over heat the chocolate oh also if you guys do see that your chocolate is you know not coming to this consistency I'll show you guys a little trick that I like using so if your chocolate is not coming out as smooth as you'd like I totally recommend melting some Crisco in a small little Bowl it could be glass or plastic just grab a little bit put some in there and I'd say do like half a teaspoon at a time and see how much you need but once it's melted just add it into your chocolate give it a mix make sure everything is well incorporated and trust me it'll come out way more smoother than it was before so definitely try it Crisco all vegetable shortening alright guys so I'm giving us chocolate some fuel mixes I'm still give me some large chunks in there so I'm gonna place a Ringo for 30 more seconds and that should do the trick okay so total time 3 minutes and 30 seconds yeah this is perfect I love the consistency let me show you this J's can see okay guys sorry my camera was not recording um but basically the chocolate is all melted so I just put it in a different cup and I'll show you guys the kind of candy colors that I love using for chocolate so these ones are here RTD chef napster colors big did have a subway no the last time I bought them so I went ahead and splurged a little bit they were a little pricey but totally worth it so all I did was just adding a drop of this pink one right here into this cup right here so now I'm just gonna slow stir I want it to be a baby pink so those colors to go a long way so definitely go a little by little it's gonna add a little bit more pink it's looking a little bit too pale for me and also these colors you always want to give them a shake for like about 30 seconds because the oil does tend to separate so just give those a quick mix and just see what kind of colors you want to play with okay that is a baby pink that I'm looking for and this one is just my white so now that our chocolate is all done I'm going to set the spatula aside bring you four variables and so flower the mold ready to start off with the basic Oreo you're just going to add in half the next one out I'm going to do three at a time once we tap it out we're gonna add in our cookie so I'll do this half or do this half Chips Ahoy so you're just gonna place it in the middle just let it drop don't push it down or anything not right now so in the middle let it drop so now I don't want to go i level see how how you're liking it so I'm just gonna press it down a little bit not all the way down just a little bit perfect so the rest of the cavity I'm just going to add in more chocolate [Applause] there you go okay and if I'm kind of seeing these are a little bit higher than the one in the front so you can use just use a small toothpick or something to just push it down a little bit and they just press them down so now we're going to do the same with the other one so again just go ahead and add in your color a little bit all right same boxes as this one right here just go ahead and hop perfect we're gonna add in our cookie it's too big oh man okay I did not see that one coming so these cookies are too big I didn't know that big fail okay man I really wanted to use those cookies I don't have a cookie cutter if not I would have used in it but I don't have it available right now so I'm just gonna do the same with the Oreo all right we're gonna push it down make sure to go a level and add more chocolate and the edges you can just take it off we'll make sure you have gloves on and again if they're raising too much go down with the utensil and there you go guys that is how you fill the mold now I'm gonna place them into the refrigerator and let them all set I'll be back to show you guys how they look okay guys so now on to the lollipop mold we're gonna do the same thing as the Oreos and we're gonna add in our chocolate about half way we're NASA cookie all right we're going to press it down go I level I got the rest of the chocolate you and then go ahead and adding your lollipop stick and add a little bit more chocolate on top so let's try the lollipop stick on first but once that lollipop stick is in there we're going to add in the chocolate on top and add a little bit more chocolate these are gonna turn out so cute okay that's perfect I set these into the refrigerator as well to set okay so these Oreos have been in the refrigerator for about 13 to 15 minutes and they are all done so I'm just gonna grab a piece of parchment paper and I'm just gonna pop them out so they're just gonna kind of release themselves or you can just go ahead and just press Rick thumbs down you look so cute okay so I'm gonna face and see but this one I here you can see the Oreo on there so that means I did press a little bit too much on there so they should have all came out like this but you know what that's okay we'll decorate it so it's not going to waste and these aren't here these ones are great it looks so cute so I did what ahead and prepped some cute little decorations because the Easter is right around the corner so all I did with this when I here is I just piped with a piping bag some white circles and some of them did turn out larger than others so basically just let the white set and then in the same bag just drop a little bit of that pink candy coloring in there go ahead and mix that up and as you guys can see I put three dots at the top and then I kind of just made a heart and to this one right here before letting the chocolate set just went ahead and added some sprinkles super easy but that's our decoration but this one's going to be for our lollipop stick so I'll leave these off to the side so the plan for this one is these are here I'm gonna drizzle with pink and this one with pink as well so I'm just gonna drizzle to one side and add some sprinkles so when I had an already melting my pink chocolate so I'm just gonna drizzle to one side quickly you're going to want to pick these up and place them on a different spot all right I'm gonna add in our sprinkles and you want to do this before the chocolate sex these sprinkles have like cute little bunnies on them it looks so cute just gonna add some of these little fancy pearls perfect and to these pink ones gonna kind of place them exactly where drizzled I'm gonna drizzle the whole Oreo with this one just make sure it's right consistency you and we're just gonna go ahead and move this off to the side and so these are gonna add some pearls okay so now I'm just gonna let these set and while these are setting I'm gonna bring up the other lollypop sticks okay so now I took these out of the refrigerator as well and these been in there for about 15 to 17 minutes so these are all done I'm gonna let them go on this parchment paper as well this day one that I used and as you guys can see this one you can still see the Oreo peeking through there but you know what that's okay we can still work with it and so for that decoration of these lollipops we're gonna spread a thin layer of chocolate I'm gonna dip it in here make sure everything is coated and then we're gonna add these cute little details of this cute so go ahead and melt your chocolate you're gonna want to get a thin layer of chocolate on the back of the spatula just go ahead and spread that around so I'm just gonna do this to the rest of them and I'll be right back [Music] well okay so now that our Molly pops are all coated with the sprinkles we're gonna go ahead and add in our decoration on top so I'm gonna add to tell right in the middle [Music] [Music] snores which is leading us love is we never trust [Music] through the wastelands through the highways some eyeshadow through the sunrays [Music] okay guys so this is the final product they look so adorable you don't even want to eat them but I mean look at these cute little bunny butts they look so funny the kids are gonna love these are on Easter yes they're just gonna fall in love this is beautiful I'm gonna show you guys how it looks when it's cut as well and for these little chocolate eggs I'm going to add like three around the center of this one right here so that it looks kind of like a nest I'm just gonna stick that on with a little bit so I'm just gonna add some chocolate right in the center okay so now that I added this and it looks like a cute little birds nests it looks so cute okay guys I'm going to show you the inside of this or no right here so we'll see how that looks okay so that is the inside of the Oreo you can see it's not too much chocolate it's like right perfectly in the center this is just perfect okay guys this is the end of the video thank you so much for watching thank you for all your love and support but this is a final product right here

[Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome [Music]", "y1yoxvTyn6c": "hey guys welcome to gingham and grit also part of twisted grapevines i'm kim beckmeyer and it's friday night in august in texas here i'm gonna go ahead just hit the glue gun and i'm gonna go ahead and make sure i'm sharing the right link with my other social media so hang on just a second i think i did it right it's been a while since i've done youtube live so usually i'm uploading to youtube so i just wanted to make sure i was doing it right um it has been a long long long week so we just started back at school and we just heard that from our school board this week that they've extended virtual learning for another two weeks so we're going to the 21st of september which is a good thing but um high school and virtual learning is it's a challenge it's a challenge for everybody it's a challenge for parents it's challenge for kids challenge the teachers so we all just have to give a lot of grace but i tell you i'm wiped out today um so what i have been promising to do i did a youtube video on the lollipops and the yarn balls using the chenille yarn so we've done these and then i started looking and i started seeing these other sweets and lollipops and candies out there the fakes and i've been really impressed by them all and haven't had a whole lot of time to get to delve and because some of that stuff out there i think is truly artwork some of the donut i saw someone had made some fake donuts today and i've seen the sundaes and other things in just quite beautiful pieces and um i'm not anywhere near there yet but i did watch probably about six or seven videos and i've kind of adapted my own own way of doing these so um laura with um she did a video and she used uh actually i did this candy based on her method she cut single strips three-fourths or i think hers were an inch i did mine three-quarters of an inch so i cut two colors strips three-quarter inch and just rolled them and you get this kind of and then i did the ends and i'll show you how to do the ends and you get this kind and i brushed it a little bit with some glitter i don't think i decoupaged this one i was just kind of playing with it but i really like the tight swirl of the two colors now mind you one side of it's really pretty the other side has a little bit it's not quite so flat and perfect and that's just because how you cut and that's okay and this was my very first attempt there's a little bit of glue on here plus it fell on the floor so it picks up a lot of the dirt off the floor unfortunately sorry that's kind of embarrassing but um so there's that right there like that so there's the good side and i just put with my pick i just put this and then i mounted this so it'll pop up in a room so that's what i did with that one and then i was watching another one and i started looking at it and i was like gosh there their things are a little bit thicker and so i sat there and i started digging through some of my supplies from last year that i didn't use and pardon me really quick i came up with this one so i found these candies that i had bought at wreath makers live and this pack of six was 12.50 and i think now after i figured out how to make these i think this is a really good price because let me pop this up but i'm going to show you unless this is craft foam that is striped i think they made it this way and i have to actually feel it i haven't i can't tell i think it might be yeah maybe it is that way i can't tell i can't tell if this was glued like they just cut half inch strips this way and glued them all together and then cut their strips the other way to get these stripes but if they did all that work then heck yeah this is worth 12.50 for six of them because oh my gosh that would be a ton of work so i don't know if they did that now if you look at this piece right here there's a curled edge on this side a rolled edge and a rolled edge on this side so i was watching i think it was scott waterman who did it and they cut their piece say like this and they folded both ends to the middle so i guess they cut this one wider and they rolled this up no i think they did about one and a half so they glued these down i think he might have used double-sided tape and i even bought some double-sided tape but this stuff didn't want to stay down mine didn't this was stronger and maybe if i was using the glitter stuff the glitter stuff is thinner and maybe that might have worked i'll have to try that i just got the glitter and i didn't realize it was thinner but it's thinner but so this was they folded inside like this to create a folded edge here and a folded edge here and then they would roll it up this way which is what i think this one did so you would have a rolled edge on both sides so if you were putting it in say for instance a centerpiece or something like that where both sides were visible i would understand the need for the double edge however if it's going on a wreath i made an adaption so i just took mine and instead of folding both sides in i just folded them in half so i cut these one and a half inch wide and then i just folded in half and so i have a rough edge here and the folded edge here which i really like this method and so if you look at this side i didn't treat this side actually use a cable mount tie to tie this onto your wreath we put this in our witches wreath um you'll see this side it's kind of a little and even a little rough this is the non-rolled side and then this side has the folded edge on it and then i dusted it with um the shiny the gloss modge podge and then i used the um extra fine iridescent glitter on top of it so be careful you don't og don't over glitter because i did that on one of them and it it doesn't change the color but it alternated it it went as vibrant as i wanted it to be it didn't pop like i thought and also i'm thinking i want to make these a little bit bigger too i want to make them these were two by two squares and i think i'm going to do three by two tonight we'll play and see because i like them if you'll see right here they're a bit fatter i like the fatter ones on those so it's a learning process it's me deconstructing and trying to figure out how to do all these and like i said i came up this is my way of doing it i just fold it in half but this side will never be seen because it's going on a wreath so my stuff is usually going on a wreath and so therefore i can you know shortchange a little bit and make it go a little bit faster because as laurie jacob says time is money and so we want to be careful and mindful of all that so as i was saying i cut these at an inch and a half wide and so i bought these right here from hobby lobby and i think they're what are these i think they're 18 by 12 maybe yeah these are 12 by 18 pieces of foam and you get them in all sorts of colors they're 99 cents you can buy them in packs um so just however you want to do it and then originally i didn't buy the sparkle because i was thinking i was gonna just single cut them and i was like well if i'm rolling them this way there's no sparkle on the edge so why would these are extra 50 cents why would i spend the extra money if you're not going to see the sparkle but if i'm folding them in half like i did right here you see the sparkle so um i went ahead and bought some the other day the only thing is is i wanted this green color and i haven't found the green and the sparkle yet that's what i really wanted because i wanted to do these three for this um gingerbread thing we have i wanted to do those three i still may do it and use this one and just you know do the decoupage the mod podge on it but um but there's a lot of pretty colors like i thought this would be this emerald's really big this year for christmas it was a really pretty involved like look at this red this is just really cute look at that red and green beautiful you could do a lot of fun candies with that you can even pick a white with it too you could do a three that's her um my business partner rivet um other part of twisted grapevines she i was going okay so do you want me to do you know green and orange orange and purple purple green she's like yes i was like okay look at all three so we did all three on this one and i think it came out really really cute all right so here's this guy right here okay and so um that's what we're gonna do so i'm gonna pan down i did just get um a new thing uh i or a new cordless um glue gun or ryobi for my birthday this week and if any of you guys i haven't even looked at my my facebook or anything all week i kid you not it has been so crazy at work this week with this virtual school stuff that i haven't even like to see anything but anyways my sweet husband got me a cordless uh ryobi glue gun and he got me two battery packs for it rechargeable battery packs but he forgot to get the charger so the charger is on its way and so anyways i'm still using this one and every time i feel the the cord on this i go oh i'm getting ready to get rid of that i'm so excited so anyways i'm gonna pan down and show you how i cut these and then how we build these so here we go so you can make all your own sweets for this holiday season all right so if you don't um can't see or you need a better explanation let me know so and i apologize my work area is a hot mess um so i'm gonna put this i'm gonna just line up this in and this in here and then see that and it's not gonna be perfect i tried to get these perfect and i was using a ruler and everything and it just doesn't go perfect put my phone over here all right so i got this really nice metal ruler i was wanting the quilter's ruler that was 18 inches can i want to so i probably need to order one i just didn't have time so i'm going to measure up from my baseline one and a half inch i'm going to put this side here and i'm going to do it on this side here all right and then i'm going to use my rotary cutter and then just glide it right along and i'm pressing down i tried cutting two at once and i really need to replace my rotary and blade and so two just wasn't cutting it now yeah the one cutting up that so i need to do i need to get new blades in here i hate putting new blades in though because i always cut myself when i put new ones in because it's so sharp and i've been dealing with the dull one for so long all right so i'm going to go up another one and a half inch so when i fold one and a half inches it'll give me three quarter inches all right oops but of course it doesn't get as clean okay so there we go all right so then what you once you get these cut one and a half inches you want to take your edges right here and we're gonna use glue or hot glue and we're just gonna run a thin bead i love this kind of glue gun because it's got that really thin point right there and then we're just gonna match them up and just hold it for a second the foam um it dries pretty quick so you don't have a whole lot of time to play with it and i kind of hold it there for just a little bit and i've got pretty calf's fingers and i just kind of pull the excess glue off okay and i've already glued these two together so i'm gonna do four pieces together because i made this one and just a smaller one it was three colors and i used four pieces all together and i got two two candies out of it so i had to reverse the colors on them because you'll use more since the purple's the outer color you'll use more of the purple so i reverse it on the other way these matched up pretty good sometimes you glue them together and they don't match up so bright and you're like whoa what happened to that cut job okay so i'm gonna glue and hold these here real quick and those of you who are joining in if you have not subscribed i would really appreciate if you could do that for me that would be awesome let's see here okay so i've got four strips right here and once you get the strips on there that one's looking i'm going to start on the other end just because it's going to be a little bit there all right we're going to run glue and like i said you could fold them if you wanted the the folded edges on both sides you could do it this way you fold this side in and that side in but um that's kind of long so i'm going to run glue right here toward my edge and i'm just folding mine straight in half you don't want to be right on the edge because then the glue is going to seep out and it's okay if it seeps out because it's on the cut edge it doesn't matter but you might burn yourself and that that does matter i'm not a big fan of burning myself even though my fingers are pretty i don't know we all say we don't have fingerprints anymore crafters because we you get the glue guns kind of burning off the hot glue does okay now the craft foam is pretty darn forgiving so if you mess up you can usually pull it apart and fix it so i'm just holding it down just kind of smooth it over and if it pops open just put a little bit more glue right there yeah i was going to wait till tomorrow afternoon and do this live and i was like i'm awake i've been wanting to do this you know how sometimes you just have things that loom over your head and it's like if i don't get this done i'm not going to rest like i said i've been wanting to do this always and they're just buzzing at time and i'm not for sure i think tomorrow night we're going live i'm not for sure it might be today's husband's perfect i don't remember if it is i'll go live um i've got a what i want to do i need to do it i want to do but i've got a real pretty cheetah print [Music] sorry brain just totally locked up there um awareness cancer breast cancer awareness week that i'm going to be so i had cassie who paints a lot of signs for me she painted and i gave her a picture off of the ribbon and i said can you make a sign out of this does that of course because i wanted the colors reversed now and so of course she did it splendidly all right so we're just going along this like i said i did it some where i put the glue out kind of in the middle and that didn't work out super great because it tends to pop open if you put it your glue too close to the middle so you want it a little bit toward the edge but not super close to the edge where it'll spit out if that makes sense because that's you know an official crafting trim spinning out all right yeah we're all starting to get the hang i teach high school math and so we're all starting to get the hang of the virtual classroom it'll be interesting monday nights are open house and we have to do it virtually so we were having to make you know introduction videos we're going to be doing zoom meetings for parents and they get a google doc to sign in on and i'm just like oh my gosh that's just crazy all right and part of my lights just dimmed i just noticed and i taken my other light source afterwards because i had to do my video for the parents but i tell you what is exhausting is looking at like three computer screens and a phone and just constantly all day long of just being bombarded with messages and oh goodness and i know it's got to be just as crazy for the kids having to find where everything is and we're all trying to do things real similar so the kids don't have to look in a million when places but big gracious think it's so confusing i know they gotta be confused their parents are confused it's just it's just hard and you just miss seeing your kids face to face i can't learn their names real well because i can't see them i mean i see you know a tiny screen but not very much of them so it's hard to it's hard to really remember except you know like if they need tutoring and they hang out afterwards with you and then you get to kind of talk a little bit because high school kids are so much fun to talk to and they break down the walls and kind of show who they are okay so i've got i'm gonna do one in the third power that dripped on the thing that drip glued down onto that there you go sorry about that so this part of my hand doesn't is it couched all right so i'm gonna do two different ones i'm gonna do one in threes and then i'm gonna do one in the glitters i haven't done the glitters before so i'm gonna do this way um so i've got the purple folded i've got the orange and i've got the green now when you start these so you want to make sure all the folded edges are on the same thing and i'm going to start with one first and i'm going to put just a little bit of glue right here in the center like that and i'm going to just tuck it over super tight and i'm going to hold it cinches there getting the very beginning super tight because you don't want to have gaps in it uh that's probably this is the hardest part is getting it tight and it's really kind of tricky with the three i didn't have so much problem with this one as i did with the other one like this okay so i get that one in and now i'm gonna come in and i'm gonna butt the i'm gonna bet the orange right up next to that curved end right there and if you want to put a little drop of glue to kind of help it hold it in place make sure you just put it in the middle because you don't want it spitting out i hope i didn't get too much right here yeah i'm good all right so see how i kind of just put that right there i'm gonna hold that and let it go down pretty tight okay and then i'm going to take my green and i'm going to stack my green in here too i'm going to just pull it yeah i'm going to just move it down about it looks like a quarter to an eighth inch right behind it so i'm gonna put a little drop of glue right there to kind of give me a little bit maneuverability i'm gonna hold it and see if you can see right there a little bit better so i'm gonna hold it right there as well see if i can pull this down just a little more nastier work area sorry guys okay so let's see start rolling like i said you want to keep it tight here at the beginning you're going to keep it tight for the whole thing okay i've got a little gap right there so i'm gonna go backwards a little bit and i'm gonna try and kick that a little bit tighter like i said this is the hardest part right here all right so i'm gonna actually put it down here on the table so i can have my rough edges are up so the fold side is down so it's all even down on that side because this is the back okay so see what i have right there whoops can you see all right so real tight so it actually works better to start on the bottom of the table i mean turning it upside down so i am just carrying this out here and we're just spinning it around and you're keeping it super tight you're holding it down on your flat table and like i said you'll feel your uneven cuts back here that it's being flat on the front and like i said i put mine on wreaths some people put these in plastic so i don't think the back would show either if you're feeling more sorry there's more of those if you're putting it in plastic you know like a plastic bag a decorative type thing and then tie me that i don't think that would be bad either if you have the the rough back it just seems like it would take a lot of time to to glue two sides down because you saw i mean that wasn't like super long to do that one color but it could it could start making it okay so we're just spinning eat some good music okay so that looks like a good size i mean you can make it bigger if you want to i mean just wherever you're putting i mean it's going to make a statement wherever you do it so just kind of you know wherever you want to finish it i'm going gonna go i'm gonna i'm gonna stop right here so i'm gonna you're gonna cut it in stages so i'm gonna cut the green one the one closest on the inside first and then i'm gonna put a tiny drop of glue right there in the middle okay and just kind of like we staggered it in the beginning we're gonna stagger it here as well so and if you keep this really tight you don't need to put glue anywhere in the middle as you roll all right so i'm going to cut this about it looks like oh let's say about a quarter of an inch longer than the green and i'm gonna put a tiny bit of drop of glue right there as well in the middle and we're gonna push down and hold it for a second and then i'm going to come with the purple the final color right and i'm going to make it just a little bit longer than the orange like i said we're staggering all of these about a quarter of an inch oops i didn't stagger that one very much probably should have done that one a little bit more it should have been a little bit longer oh well we're gonna put the candy tie right there anyways so it's not gonna i usually like to pull it a little bit longer so that way it's not quite so breast of a end right there i like it to taper a little bit more but that was me sorry a big old finger was in the way all right so that's what the three does so that's what you get it looks really pretty all right i'm gonna hold that just a little bit longer i'm gonna kind of mash it here in the middle make sure it's all flush to the front okay so once you're here you have a choice you have a choice of whether you want to make a lollipop or whether you want to make a candy so if you want to make a lollipop i use um i use my ice pick right here and right here where this piece is i would insert you know drill a hole right here and then i would use these guys right here you get these um i found these at walmart bamboo skewers in the um what is it the kitchen utensil area and right where you drilled that hole i would take the pointy end and put a drop of glue on it and insert it in there okay so that's how i would make a lollipop um and then i bought i think it was cindy who taught me this trick let me grab this really quick i found these on amazon because i was making a lot a bunch of lollipops for one of our reef kits and i got tired of wrapping ribbon and she's like look you know you can buy straws so i got this box 200 straws from amazon and it's got eight colors in it so you know you pick your color and i just put a drop of glue at the top and i just and i put it up to where it meets and then i cut the bottom and then i just put glue right there and look how cute that is i mean like if you have that inserted right like that that would be so cute and you don't have to wrap a shortcut so really like that trick so i've been using that trick a whole lot i like that one okay so i'm gonna do the candies on this one so i'm gonna use a piece of craft foam and like i said when i did this one right here and all the videos i watched they made these two by two squares but i like i think i want this a little bit wider so i think i'm gonna try a three by two tonight and i'm gonna get pinking shears as well so you know the ones that cut the zigzag all right then i'm gonna cut three of my four sides using those so let's see here we're gonna do all right i'm just using my scissors so one two three and then we want to do two i was like what is that and it's the tag that's weird feeling okay so on these right here i'm gonna go ahead and cut i'm gonna leave one edge long because that's going to be where we fit in i'm going to go ahead and paint the others so whatever color is on the outside that's the color on the little wrapper all right so we're going to fold this guy in half so fold it in half and i'm going to put just a little drop of glue right there at the end you don't want to carry your glue too far out because then it's going to be real long and skinny and i like them short and fat like see this one i made it too long i took my glue too far out i like them where they're just short okay and then i'm going to put a drop right here on the back and then we're going to follow this piece down we're going to do the same thing on the other side oops stay and put a drop right there we're gonna fold this piece back so you're gonna fold it in half and then fold it each side in half again so it's really in force all right ooh i like that a lot better yeah i like it wider so you can either put your curl this way or you can put your curl that way it just depends on which look you want um i kind of like it with the ridges up so i'm going to take this one i'm going to put glue on this end right here and where that was you know that sharp end right there i'm gonna put it right there a little hot not too bad but a little bit i use um multi-temp so i try to use the the cooler not the super super hot glue i accidentally i ran out of glue and i had pulled from an old bag and it was hot high temp glue and this is a multi-temp and you know i just assumed it was still oh good gracious it took forever i had a burn right there it took forever for that thing to heal that was not fun okay so that's what we have right here so let's do one more of these so i'm gonna once again i'm gonna pink the one one long edge and the two short edges and if you want these you know shorter you can always trim them i've trimmed some before so we're gonna put a little bit of glue right there in the middle i'm gonna need some more glue that's the thing i gotta get for my new glue gun too i gotta get some glue because this is these use those little mini sticks and my new one uses the big ones so hopefully i won't have to be refinishing blue quite so much so where always herpes is always like okay some more glue yeah oh shoot i stuck my finger right in there i tried wearing those little finger fingertip cards and it just doesn't work for me i've got to feel it which means you can feel all of it unfortunately all right so i'm pinching this and holding it or as rhonda says pin to it okay and i'm gonna put some glue right here and then i'm gonna go straight across this one and hold it in place make sure that they're both going the same direction both of these have the crimped edges going up like i said you could have made them go the other way it's just personal choice so there we go there's our little our candy for tonight that's using three and like i said if you're putting this on a wreath so here's what the back looks like so see i don't think that would be bad if you packaged it in plastic like right here so like say i had a clear plastic bag say this was a lollipop or something and you were to put it in the bag you know and tie it at the string like i don't think that would show like here's this side with the thing i don't think that would show it's so much faster to do to do just the one fold and the two so i mean it's just kind of like i said personal choice all right okay so i'm going to do and i tell you what to if you if your um craft tabletop is as dirty as mine gets it will pick up every piece of bread in your your table so um the pick the ice picks really good for picking out the stuff so let's go ahead while this is here and let's go ahead and um let's decorate it for modules so i don't like to use my super good brushes with mod podge because modge podge is like a glue so in case i forget to go wash it right away or if it gets crusty you know these little cheap ones you can get these at the dollar tree now which is really nice all right okay so i'm just gonna like well there you go we might need to put a little glue on this one to hold this guy on there i haven't had that happen before it's alive so it's going to happen right it seems to thank you all right so we're just gonna i'm gonna actually do my sides so i'm gonna go here on my sides you know get ready because you're gonna get it on youtube so it just and i try to go in here and if i have any of the the crevices or whatnot i try to fill them up it just adds a little bit reinforcement so it doesn't come undone and go in here and do this as well like i said can you really over glitter i don't know and you can glitter the back you want to if it's going to show on both sides this is only going to show on the front so i'm going to probably not do the back just because i don't have to put this glue on the back except we require you doing two different things all right so we're just going to cover this in mod podge like i said i got the shiny and i didn't even know they made shiny i think it was lara who mentioned the shiny lara jean and i was like oh didn't even know they knew china we're just used to the mod podge from the 70s where we would cut up calico strips and put them on plaster do i remember some of those who are all i'm old um old as me and we used to oh that was a craft we used to do with our moms all the time and it was um you cut old calico scraps and i remember we had this dog and uh you cut them up and you use pinking shears to cut them and then you would decoupage them on there or mod podge i think i got one of those in a white elephant gift one year for christmas when i was older when sam my husband and i went to a white elephant christmas party and here i am now you know playing with decapod or mod podge i always call it decoupage it's hard to call it mod podge all right so i'm gonna put this aside so i kind of did it lightly i didn't do it real you know real thick i don't want glitter snowballs okay so i'm gonna take this and i'm gonna just dust it like i said i have this real fine um it's real fine glitter dust i have this iridescent dust and the fine i have it in a not fine the not fine ones i use on what do i use on the chenille lollipops get the edges here you know just put on something that you can collect the glitter because i do reuse but falls off i'll get crafters reuse so here we go so it looks really light right now but when you um when it dries this is going to dry the mod podge dries clear and the sparkle shows so i'll show that right here so that's what we have so far okay so this is what it looks like when it dries so it goes from this too so the colors become really vibrant when it dries i really like that about the and that's that's because of the shiny that and the iridescent makes it pop a little bit too okay i feel like i'm in class and i say all right are there any questions that's what i've been doing all week okay does anyone have any questions before i move on all right so i'm going to go ahead and collect some of my glitter right here i want to do one more with the already glitter material because i haven't used that yet so that'll be this will be made in voyage with that stuff okay so let's see here and i was going to tell you too with these leftover pieces right here i think the green one fell down over here this one so now the green is the longest you can repeat the procedure fitting the green on the outside going this way and you'll finish with the green on the outside and you can get a whole other lolli i mean candy out of this one so oh hi angie oh thank you so much i have made and i actually did a tutorial with the yarn as well so like i did the balls and like here the lollipops so i did those too and um i i was watching something and i was like okay those are different and i was looking at them really close and so i go what are those made out of and i sat there and i looked and i go i think they're made out of foam and so i um i ended up watching like six or seven videos and i kind of came up with my own little method of how to do this so that this one right here was done on a single cut so this is three quarter cut three-quarter inches two colors and just rolled tight this was cut on an inch and a half but it's folded so this inch or this edge right here is um a folded edge and then the back side is a cut edge so because i use all of mine in wreaths i just use a cable mount on the back and do it like that if you want a lollipop you know of course don't put these ends on and you know put the stem right there but i use the shiny mod podge to give it that that really bright it really makes it pop and then use that iridescent fine glitter so that's what i do on those now this one right here i didn't make this one i actually bought this one this one the fold is on front and back so you could use this on something that you were going to see you know 360 all the way around like a centerpiece or something and so on that one i watched someone do a video and i'm looking for a strip of folded online but what they did on theirs was you would fold it in on this side and then you would fold it you know in on this side and then you would roll it that way so that's kind of what that one how that one was done right there they folded like that which to me is a lot of folding and a lot of glue and a lot of potential to burn myself um i saw one where they they put double-sided tape in the middle and then they folded it there but i couldn't get this stuff to hold it was i tried but i went having a lot of success with it so anyways i i just like the single fold because the rough side i won't it won't show on what i use it for and then you know and i do i did three colors and i'm getting ready to do one with two so this i haven't used before this is new so i cut i think three strips on this one the long strips and this already had the glitter on it i really wanted to do these three colors for something a project i'm working on but this one i haven't found yet in the glitter so i've got to check one more spot that may have it so i'm gonna just do these two tonight so let's see if we can get these going all right so when you start these you want to stagger them so you want one a little bit longer than the other all right and then you're going to start rolling and you want it super duper tight so i'm going to put it down here on my table because i may have not cut them super great so i want the part that's facing down on the table to be all the same length so if there's any parts like my glue for my fingers is coming off so if any parts are uneven they'll show up on the back not on the front we've got a new kit coming out soon we just got the gingerbread we have painted for us and it's in pink red white and the green and so that's why i was wanting to put the different colors i was thinking of putting the red with this too but i don't like the red with the white and the pink maybe the oh i bet the red and the pink yeah okay that's what i'm gonna do next so this one i don't think i'm gonna make it on this one i think i'll make a lollipop on this one i don't know let me do it so when you curl it you just want to make sure it's super tight as you curl it and um so you don't have holes in there and like i said we're keeping i can see i see my little bumps all back here okay so i think i only cut two strips of or three i think i cut three strips of the white i don't know why i didn't cut four probably i got distracted because that's where my head is today after a long week at work okay all right so that's how far we got like i said it picks up a lot of stuff off your table so i'm going to flip it over ooh that looks cool i like that look how pretty that looks right there that came out cute and it's already glittered so i don't have to glitter it okay so i'm gonna my white one ended right here so i'm gonna cut this about half an inch longer i may not need it a full half inch it may go more like three eighths and i'm going to put a little drop in the middle of glue you don't want to put too much because you don't want it to seep out both sides like that right there might okay and then we're just gonna hold it now so angie when you made your yarn and lollipops did you use the big yarn or did you use just the regular yarns or did you use that big chunky yarn i've done them both where's one right here i did um like i did this one for halloween these are in the little the little yarns i like the big and like here's the ball in the little yarns i got there's that double-sided tape so i did those and then i love mixing the the jude with it that'll really like doing because i've got a real retro halloween wreath that has a lot of the muted colors that i was going to put these two guys in but i like but i really do love the chunky the chunky's just just so bubbly okay look i have blue from that i think that's the mod podge all right so there's that guy right there so i'm gonna take this my i'm gonna just go in right there so i'm just jabbing it in and then i'm gonna take one of my um bamboo skewers from walmart the kitchen section and i'm gonna put hot glue on it and i'm gonna just kind of twist it in there we're going to let that dry and then i was telling them that i bought sam's club this box of 200 and it has eight colors in it let's see if my pink smells like they match okay so so then i'm gonna take this guy right here i'm gonna put a drop well let me put it on here first all right and i'm gonna put a little bit of glue here at the top of it and then smash it all these great verbs to not smash jab sounds so violent and then i put a drop of glue down here too if i need this to um mount in a wreath i keep it on there but more than likely i'm cutting it off but it's there all right so i'm going to go ahead and put the glue and if you wanted to you could put a real pretty bow right there as well where the straw meets the edge that's so cute oh my gosh and i got the cutest ribbon i'm gonna get that from i got a trendy treat but it's white with crimped um pink it's cut with the pink shears oh it's so super sweet but is it white it might be cream it may not work maybe you may just have to get a pink oh darn i've got to go look for ribbon you know i hate that so anyway so there's that one so this is done with the fold both of these were done with the fold that i made tonight and um that's just something i kind of created from watching all the videos i watched but you can make them also like i said in this singular these are pretty too but you could do them with the candy i like it with the wider so i do i do like we did these three by two so i like the wider cut and then this is with the the lollipop all right so that's what i got for you guys tonight i'm going to do another one tomorrow so let me lift up real quick so nice so there we go i guess i can squat all right so tomorrow i'm going to do one during the day i've had a lot of people ask how i make my pumpkins so i'm going to do tutorial i have i did a pumpkin and i love mustard so and this has kind of it's almost like a sear sucker because it's got the puckers on it so i'll make one of these i've got an order for some cheetah so i will make a cheetah one i'll make a couple different sizes and use some different types of fabric so you can see how they work and then i use real dried pumpkin stems that i got on ebay so i will do that tutorial tomorrow and i think tomorrow night we are doing a breast cancer awareness wreath so that when i think summer facebook live but i'm gonna do another youtube with the pumpkins so anyways lots of fun of the i've been having a lot of fun making all these um attachments for wreaths so i think they're just so fun and plus it you can do them really quick and it's like you've got something you've accomplished whereas a wreath sometimes takes a while to do so it's kind of fun to have something all finished so anyways oh you use chunky yarn too yeah i love the chunky yarn i think it's really cute and it's hard to find right now so i ran out of um wife the other day and oh my gosh i had to go to so many stores to find white it just nobody had white everybody's using it so um i really like the chunky one i think it's plus it goes so fast because when you do the little yarn oh my goodness it takes a long time but the big one you're done you have to make that sound too when you do it um so hope you can come join us tomorrow and like i said i'll do it on youtube the pumpkins and then tomorrow night we'll be doing breast cancer witness so hope to see you then y'all have a great friday night rest after year long week i know i'm going to and it was 107 degrees in texas today in the metroplex dallas fort worth it was so hot so i'm escaping to the roof room and just it takes it out of here so hope y'all have a great weekend and pop by and say hi and i'll see you later all right good night you", "iKLQS9D1Qi4": "[Music] hey everybody I figured I wanna show you how to make my strawberry cake pops with a vanilla chocolate on top of them and then we're gonna sprinkle some of the extra cake on top of that just for a little bit of decoration these are really great they work well for Valentine's Day and they work well for any other holiday too but since they're pink I decided that I would share with you guys this recipe for Valentine's Day so you can make them for someone special you can turn these into a bouquet you can put them on a platter I have a bladder here that I have used some cute little Valentine paper for and I have a heart dish that I'm gonna be placing these cake pops on when they are done first up that you need to do with the cake pop recipe issue you want to take your cake mix and you want to go ahead and make it her directions on the box and cook your cake one mine are already cooled [Music] and we're going into a bowl and then we are literally just going to crumble the cake into little bits then we're gonna add our icing we're gonna mix it up and then we're gonna form them into balls and then we're going to have to excuse me then we're gonna have to put them into the freezer until they get hardened and cold this will help the vanilla chocolate that we're going to be putting over it harden a little bit faster so if you're ready I'm ready going alright so as you can see I have taken my cake and I have crumbled it up I have tried to get all the big pieces and you want to make sure that it's all crumbled up nicely it doesn't really per se matter but emits this better and you have the same consistency through your crumbs now we're gonna be taking or icing and I only did one 9-inch round in this bowl because it's not a very large bowl so we're gonna be taking half of our icing but in there we're going to mix it up and then we're going making power falls and then we're gonna have to pop those into the freezer for probably about ten minutes just long enough for them to get cold alright so once you have taking your icing mixed up you're going to want to use to get the smooth [Music] what you want to do is you just want to take about a tablespoon of it roll it up into a ball like so and then place it on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet parchment paper is going to come in handy when we go to put our almond bark vanilla almond bark onto the outside of the cake balls that way it doesn't make a big mess on the pan it's easier to clean up and they're easier to check it off that way go ahead and get the rest of these done and then once they've come out of the freezer from being in there for 10 minutes I'm going to show you how to cut up the almond vanilla bark and then how to melt it and then we're going to be dipping them in there and then we're going to allow them to dry and harden and then after that I'm going to put some of my platter when it comes to cutting your bark chocolate you're gonna want to use pretty hefty size knife it makes it easier to cut you're just gonna simply go like this and push it down like so okay so we're gonna have to chop this right so you feel like this you just break it down pretty simple so you get these little like shreds and it falls apart basically so then we're gonna go ahead and get all this cut up we're gonna put it in a bowl and we're going to melt it in the microwave doing first a thirty second increment and then increment ten seconds all right once you get your chocolate melted you want to make sure that you take some of your extra cake crumbs and you just make them into little teeny tiny pieces scooch it close up of it there you go you don't have to be somewhat small cuz there's going to be decoration on the top of our cake pops okay so now I'm going to be using a fork you don't want to stab the cake pop you just want to rest it on there you're gonna put it in two chocolate flip it over you want to make sure is nice and coated [Music] like that then we're going to want to put it over here [Music] or cake put it on top all right there you go I have put some of the cake pops right here on this platter and I have added these cute little glittery hearts on there with Valentine paper and then on this one I just have some of these other glittery hearts in there and I turned my cake box into a bouquet and I have adorned it with on the bottom these are just wonderful they're great for Valentine's they're great for any time of the year but especially Valentine's because the pink fits in perfectly I hope that you guys love this recipe as much as I do and I hope that you all have a wonderful Valentine's Day thank you for watching bye bye [Music]", "MNoBAVsloJ0": "mmm-hmm all right let's go [Music] [Applause] hi Julie I'm on Julie's traveling in the country man will kill the check for the raspberry Jolly Rancher triple pop one lollipop from Hershey", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "vxDsf_KMnxg": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we are making our own candy lollipops, spirals, candy with a pattern on the inside\nand sherbet filled candies. What you'll need to make these is some sugar,\nglucose syrup, water and some cream of tartar. Put the sugar and the water into the pan with\nthe glucose syrup. Place that over high heat. If you've got any sugar crystals on the sides\nof your pan then you just want to wash those down using a wet pastry brush. Turn your oven on to 100C or 210F and place\na tray lined with non-stick baking paper in to warm up. Let your sugar mixture boil until it reaches\n150C or 302F. Turn off the heat and stir through the cream\nof tartar. Now we will follow this same basic process\nfor all of our candies. For the sherbet filled candy add yellow food\ncolouring and stir it through. And then pour that into a warm tray that has\nbeen lined with baking paper. Now to protect our hands from the heat we\nare going to use .. silicone gloves but these are not going to be enough so we are also\ngoing to use cotton gloves underneath them. Oh, and let me show you my nails while we\nare here - these are one of the designs in my own line of wraps that I'm doing with Jamberry. These ones are called YUM and they have cute\nlittle icecreams on them and I'll link to them below. For those of you who asked last week what\nare wraps? They are bit like stickers made out of nail\npolish, and you use a little bit of heat to stick them onto your nails. And they last up to few weeks. We are going to put these ones through some\nrough treatment today with heat and gloves and in and out of gloves. Fold in the edges towards of the hot sugar\ntowards the centre and then lift it up and begin to pull it out and then fold it back\nin. The more you pull it, the more shiny and opaque\nit becomes. If you want it to be transparent then don't\npull it much at all. Place it back in the tray and flatten it out\nas much as you can and then put it in the oven to warm up again. Now that it's warm you can stretch it into\na rectangle. Now usually when chefs make this sort of candy\nthey have a heat lamp shining on the candy that keeps it warm while it's on the counter\nso you don't need to keep putting it back in the oven, but they are super expensive\nso this is the way to do it home. Place a generous amount of sherbet down the\ncentre of your rectangle and then bring the sides up and around to cover it. Push down each of the ends to seal in the\nsherbet. Squeeze it to make a cylinder shape and then\nplace it back in the oven for about 30 seconds to a minute, just keeping an eye on it because\nyou don't want to overheat it. Once you can just stretch it when it's soft\nenough to stretch, pull the candy to make a long snake. Working quickly before it hardens make firm\nindents along the candy so that you are sealing in the sherbet into each one. To make lollipops we'll need a few different\ncolours in the one batch. So place strips of foil along the tray and\nthen cover it in baking paper. Prepare the candy just like we did before\nbut this time add a few drops of essence, I am using a fairy floss flavour. You can buy all different ones and then just\nflavour your candy. Pour some hot mixture into each of the sections. And then to get you pan clean all you need\nto do is fill it up with water and leave it to soak and the sugar will just dissolve off. Add food colouring to each section in the\ncolours that you are after for your lollipop. And then using scissors, cut along the baking\npaper so you can work with one colour at a time. Fold it into the middle and then stretch it\nuntil it becomes opaque. Make it into a snake and then set it aside. Repeat that with the blue. And the red\nAnd the yellow and the clear one as well to make it white Then warm them slightly again in the oven\nand place them together to make a cylinder and squeeze them so that they stick together. Cut the cylinder in half and leave some to\nkeep warm while you stretch the other half. Twisting as you stretch so you get that pretty\npattern. Take a lollipop stick and poke it into one\nend then wrap the mixture around and around pressing it into place. And you can keep going to make your lollipop\nas giant as you want it to be. To make the spirals remove the mixture from\nthe heat and add in flavouring, for this one I am using musk. Split it into two sections and add red colouring\nto one half and blue into the other. We are going to take the blue half and pull\nit and stretch it to make it opaque but with the red half we are just going to leave that\nand not pull it all. Keep pulling the blue half and twisting it\nso that you can see there the more we pull it and the more we twist it the more opaque\nand shiny it becomes. Don't pull the red half just cut it in half\nto make two long cylinders. Pull the blue into two long snakes too and\nthen stack them up to make a square. It looks a bit like toothpaste. Squeeze them together to round it out and\nthen cut that into two. Working with one half pull it and make it\nthinner into a nice thin long stick. And you can slice it while ti is warm to make\nindividual candies OR to make the spirals, wrap it around a thick skewer. Once it is all the way to the end you can\njust pull the skewer out and leave those to cool. See how the pink there is totally transparent\nbecause we didn't pull it and the blue is opaque. The other thing you can do is roll some of\nthis mixture into a ball and make round lollipops and just put a stick in one end. And you can make as many different candies\nas you like just by flavouring and colouring each one differently. And now for something which is going to be\nhard to do without a heat lamp but I reckon we can do it. We're going to split the mixture into three\nand colour some red, leave some plain and colour the last section green. Pull each of the colours just like we have\ndone before to make them opaque. And then stretch the red one to make three\nlong snakes, return one to the oven to warm up. And once it is soft and pliable, place it\nacross the top of the two red snakes and shape it at the top into a point. Add some white along each side of that triangle\nand then flip it up the other way and add a strip down the centre on the top. And then finally add more white so that the\nred is completely covered. Warm your green, and stretch it out and add\nit over the top of the white so that it goes all the way around. Now you are going to need to place that back\nin the oven to warm it up because those two red ones are quite cold by now. And once it's warm you can just stretch that\ncandy out into a long strip. Now to cut it without it shattering it needs\nto be quite warm so return it to the oven until you can bend it like this. And then quickly using a sharp knife, chop\noff pieces to reveal the little heart inside.

Make it a great week and I'll see you on Friday.", "yzJWSrvHsts": "today welcome to Todd's kitchen lollipops have been around for literally hundreds of years they're incredibly simple to make but they're actually pretty expensive to buy their shops so why not just make them home they're just as delicious and you can make any flavor color that you like so join me today as make my version of lollipops okay so to start this off I have a pot on the stove on a medium heat so it to the pot I'm going to add two cups of sugar then 2/3 of a cup of glucose or corn syrup know as a hint I've just warmed it up in the microwave it just makes a lot easier to work with and finally a quarter cup of water and I'm also using a candy thermometer now we want to go for the hard crack stage which is about 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius give or take but if you have one of these candy thermometers they're actually very cheap to buy you can get them online they're only about ten fifteen dollars but when it comes to candy it just makes life so much easier so over the medium heat we're just coming to give this stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved now you can also add some for example coloring if you like then you could also add some flavoring it's completely up to you I'm just keeping this as a basic recipe so I'll leave any coloring or flavoring that you choose to add up to you a lot of people like the plain should be a taste but if you want to add like say peppermint essence or raspberry or it's you know completely up to you and to the colors that you choose so it's gonna start to get to the stage where it's going to bubble now as you can see we've got some sugar crystals just on the inside so which is with a wet brush we're just going to brush them down which is basically dissolving the sugar back into the mix and this will just stop crystals from forming on top of our sugar mixture which basically ruins of the whole thing so just keep on doing this all the way around whenever you see these sugar crystals forming so puffs and keeping an eye on the sugar crystals forming on the outside just keep an eye on the temperature until we get to the hard crack stage which is again 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius now you may be tempted to turn the temperature up to make it rise up faster to get to the right temperature faster but slow and steady is the only way to do it because if you do it too fast you can actually going to burn that sugar and it honestly doesn't take that long at all whatsoever probably about five to ten minutes to get to the right temperature so take your time don't do it too fast and you'll get some lovely candy and also my best advice is apart from the occasional watered down of the sides what have you do don't stir it because I should make things worse you just want it to cook by itself let it do its thing just let it slowly come up to the right temperature so all you have to do is just occasionally Pat down the sides and that's it it's very very simple okay so it's just about to hit the hard crack stage now I've had the tilt the pan just slightly because the thermometer was in 100% under but it's just hitting the hard crack stage right now so take it straight off the heat okay now quickly I've got a bowl here with some ice an ice bath we're just going to place that in there and this will stop the sugar from cooking just don't let it touch the glass sides because if we leave it by itself it's going to continue cooking so we just want that to stop straight away [Music] otherwise it's going to get too much of a caramelized look and it's got a slight caramelized look but that's okay doesn't have to be perfect as long as it's each her when we've done some just poured it into a another pan this is a milk pan but I'm using this because it has this whip on it and this one doesn't so it's going to make a lot easier when we want to make our popsicles now this is a part where we have to work fast so I've got a baking tray here line with non-stick baking paper that I've also breezed with some more oil just to be on the safe side so we're just going to pour in small amounts like so okay that's enough and we're going to add a popsicle stick now these are a new one I found they're like a paper based one so no more plastic and while this too wet just decorate them any way you want that's going to be done now while the mixture is still fluid so just continue on making up all about popsicles so you can find those new paper base ones fantastic for the environment if I just use what you've got and this is what I want to go with a clear one because this way I can add some decorations to it so again you can still use color it's completely up to you and you can use a flavor that hopefully it's a flavor that doesn't have a color to it if it does well that's again that's okay this is so versatile you can do anything that should like with it [Music] okay so that was more than enough to make a few batches now it depends on the size of the lollipops you want to make so I made up another couple of sets of these so we're gonna let these sit here for at least two hours to completely set so they'll be nice and hard they're going to be wondering what am I gonna do with the pot cuz it's obviously gonna have some pretty hard sugar in it by now it's very very simple all you do is just fill it with water leave it for a few hours then simply pour it out because the sugars just going to dissolve into the water and it will disappear like magic so don't worry about any hard scrubbing or scraping just simply fill it with water set forget it come back a few hours later it's gone and now would you look at those delicious candy lollipops that turned out nice and clear and pretty with those extra sprinkles and let's be honest it's a hundred percent sugar so you know it's going to be a hundred percent good so they really have turned out very well they're incredibly delicious and also incredibly simple to make and again who doesn't love lollipops especially when they're nice and colorful and fun with sprinkles you could choose any sprinkles that you like see in Australia we call those hundreds and thousands or you can go for the stars and honestly I never know what these ones are called but they look great they're like little mini pearls and you don't even have to use sprinkles you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like they're incredibly versatile and no matter what flavor you choose they're going to taste simply delicious [Music]", "4OsGdeMMnWk": "fun fruity did we say fun [Music] loved since 1958 and with a logo designed by none other than salvador dali choppa chops bring rich

porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you

[Music] I'm Nate. I'm Calli, and we have\na new slow cooker. What should we put in it? I have a couple extra lollipops. Yeah. [Music] You might not know\nwhat the word couple means. Well, I wanted a lollipop, and I figured\nif I'm buying a lollipop, I might as well buy\na couple extra. So we need a thousand\nfor the project today. Is there a thousand there? I think so. Well. better get started. We have made some hard\ncandy stuff before, and it usually seems\nto melt pretty well. So we're thinking that these lollipops\nwill melt back down, and I'm curious what's going\nto happen with the colors. We've got like two or three\ndifferent types of lollipop, and they're all multiple colors. So I'm wondering if we're gonna get\nlike swirled effect, or if it's just going to turn\nlike into a brown blob. It's going to go brown. Might depend on if we mix it. What's going to happen\nto the sticks, because we're not going\nto take the sticks out. We're just going to throw\nthat in with it, and hopefully, the sticks won't melt,\neven though they are plastic. If they do, then we're not gonna want to eat\nwhat comes out of this. So these are just Tiger Pops. Lots of pretty colors, but we're really not sure\nabout the flavor. All right, so we each need\nto count off 500. [Music] So, are you sure\nwe have a thousand? We might have a few extra. [Music] Aha! Number 1,000. We still have space,\nand we still have lollipops. So I think we should just keep\ngoing a little bit. [Music] That was an extra\ntwenty one on my part. 1,171 lollipops in a Crock-Pot. And now we turn it on,\nand see what happens. Yep. Oh, no, there's more. 71, 72, 75, 76. 1,176. We had a set to about\n250 degrees Fahrenheit, and we started getting a lot\nof smoke coming off of it. Our goal is not to just\nset it on fire, and have tons of sugar burning. So we've lowered\nthe temperature down to 150. We thought it was the candy\nburning just at first, but the sticks are melting too,\nso got to be careful of that. This may not be edible\nby the time it's all melted. Wanna make a lollipop sculpture\nhere and just [inaudible]? That's just a stick. Now, you have garbage\nin my beautiful sculpture. Hey, Mark, we made this for you. I want to try and stir it. Like I feel like that's\nonly safe way to do this. I think it's only melt\naround the edges. So we just need\nto let it sit longer, at the lower temperature. [Music] Okay, so we are having success in melting\nthe lollipops themselves. The problem that we're having\nis to get them to melt, we're having to raise it\nto such a high temperature that the sticks\nare also melting. So the plan is now, we are actually going\nto lower the heat, but also... Put a lid on. Hopefully, we can contain\nsome of that heat, and actually get an even melt. Fingers crossed. I've got this silicone cake pan, and if everything goes pretty\nwell with our melting lollipops, I want to try maybe pouring some\nof the lollipop goo into here, and making a giant\nlollipop out of it. Kind of depends on if we can get some\nof the sticks out of the way, and if everything doesn't like\nburn badly in that roaster, and something like that,\nbut we're going to give a shot. So here's a lollipop mold,\nhere's a lollipop stick. [Music] Make it a little bit smaller than the diameter\nof the stick so that... [inaudible] the lollipop\nwill leak through. [Music] I think that looks\nlike it should work pretty well. [Music] So at this point, we're going to try and\nget the sticks out. Now, most of this looks burned, but we think\nit's mixed flavour? Just maybe everything got mixed? Mine taste good. [Music] That's definitely\nsomewhat burned. [Music] Okay quick update. We were trying to melt\nhere a thousand lollipops, and I think we were\njust a little impatient. We're just trying to kind of do\nit in sort of a one-day thing, and it really burned. And we left the plastic in. We're going to try, and revisit this with\na slightly different method, because this, it's just burnt. Like it doesn't even\ntaste good anymore, and that kind\nof defeats the purpose. >> So we're going to try it again.\n>> It taste okay. We're gonna try it was\nlower heat and longer time. I think we're going to try\nletting it run like overnight, or even for a day or two just to see\nif we can get it to work. Guys, the first time we tried putting our lollipops\nin a slow cooker, what we had was actually more\nof a roasting pan. It is something\nthat can cook slowly, but it doesn't work the same way\nas a regular slow cooker. So we've adapted and changed\nthings up a little bit. So our crock pot is\na little bit different. A crock-Pot has\nthick ceramic walls, cooks things slower, but at a much more\neven ambient temperature. Hopefully, fingers crossed,\nit's not going to burn things. You can see\nthis right here, like this whole thing is... I think it can't\neven lift it out. That is full of hundreds\nof lollipops right now. So that's thick ceramic, and at no point is there\nlike a thin steel wall that gets too hot, and should start\nburning the lollipops. That was the biggest problem\nwe ran into before, is well, the inside temperature overall\nmight be controlled pretty well, the edges get too hot, and so we really started\nhaving burned sugar. So we got new lollipops. We have now unwrapped\na new thousand lollipops, and these ones actually\nhave paper sticks. So even if they are in contact\nwith a heating element, they probably, I don't think it\nwould get hot enough to burn, and definitely,\nwouldn't get it to melt. So we've got\nour new slow cooker, which is now very very full of unwrapped lollipops\nwith paper sticks. And unfortunately, we can't fit\nall 1000 in at first. So we have a plan. Plan's going to\nbe pretty simple. We are going to wait\nuntil this melts down, and as it does, we're going to add\nthe rest of them. So this is what? 800 almost or-- Yeah, I'd say we probably added\nabout 800, and 200 here. So once those 800 melt down,\nwe're going to pour in the rest, and hopefully,\neverything melts evenly, and then we can pour\nit into our mold. If the glass top gets\nto covered in steam, we'll probably take that off. It would go slower\nwithout the top, so we're hoping\nthat doesn't happen, but we'll keep an eye on it. And if it gets opaque, so we can't see\nthe lollipops melting, we'll remove it. [Music] Our lollipops are\nthoroughly cooked. More thoroughly than we were expecting them\nto become in fact. Or that we wanted\nthem to become. I was confident that the low setting\non a slow cooker like this, with the ceramic pot\nto evenly distribute the heat, would keep it all low enough that we wouldn't have\na burning problem. I was wrong. So that was just a piece that had bubbled over\nand drip down the side. and I was just tasting it,\nsee what it's like, and it's very burned tasting. There is like a fruity\ntangy flavor to it. But then it's also\njust pretty acrid. Taste like burnt sugar, huh? Yeah, that's burnt sugar\nwith a little bit of flavoring. Let's see if we\ncan get this lid off. It bubbled over\nlike around the lid, then it cooled down. So now the lid is\npretty well attached, and it's glass. Wait, see if we can just\npick the whole thing up by the lid handle. Okay, you go for that. >> Oh, well, we got the lid off.\n>> Well, it worked. Okay. Now, we have what looks like a pot\nfull of pretzel sticks. That one actually broke\nlike a pretzel stick. Usually, lollipop sticks\nlike his will just bend. This is just... That's like your pretzel. [Music] You can break them,\nbut you can't really chew them. Mmm. It's a weird combination\nof sour and bitter. Actually, it still\nsmells quite good. >> It smells like lollipops.\n>> It really does. These were our remaining few that we did manage to get\ninto the crock pot before it boiled over. This has more smell than this. Really? Wait. Yeah. That doesn't really\nsmell like much to me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think burning it, or even this cooking it kind\nof brought that smell out. It smells very fruity. Like a candy fruit flavor,\nbut like a fruit flavor still. Check this out. The sugar is about here. So that means\nwe have four inches of solid burned cooked sugar\nfull of lollipop sticks. Look, it's a new\nsort of lollipop. Oh, yes. It's the sideways lollipop\nthat gouges in to your face. Those will be very popular. [Music] I regret everything. It's interesting. You really can still taste\nlike the fruit flavors of the lollipop mixed in\nwith the burning flavor. I was expecting a lot more\nof like a smoky burnt flavor. Yeah. Yeah. This is just bitter. Well, I'm surprised\nthat it did this. I have learned something\nabout crock pots. From what I researched, it said that the low setting\nshould be under 200 degrees. But I assume that even though we had\nthe thick ceramic pot, it still had hot spots\nwhere right at the edges, it was getting higher\nthan that temperature, and the temperature that I looked up must have been\nthe average inside temperature. The ambient temperature. Yeah, so we were getting burning as you probably saw\nin the time-lapse. It kind of foamed up, bubbling and burning\non one side. A little bit on both sides,\nmore on one side than the other, and just took over everything. Yeah, and it was\naround the edges. So I'm-- Yeah, like you said, I assumed that heat was much\nmuch higher than expected. This doesn't taste\nnearly as burnt. Yep. It's more efficient this way. I don't think that word means\nwhat you think it means. I do not think it means\nwhat you think it means. Guys, that's not all. We've always got more\nfor you to see.

In honor of the new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic\nWorld, that is coming out, I thought we should make a themed treat. Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite,\nclassic movies, I love Dinosaurs and I have seen this movie so many times,\nso I wanted to make something from the original. Today we are gonna be making Amber Fossil\nThemed Lollipops. Let\u2019s get started! The things you will need, will be: 1/3 cup\nof light corn syrup, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 a cup of water, orange and yellow food\ncoloring, because an amber fossil walks the line on the color wheel between\nyellow and orange. Then 1/2 a teaspoon of flavoring, I\u2019m using orange flavoring,\nbut again, you can also use lemon or whatever flavor you\u2019d like. Some black licorice\ncandy, baking scissors, lollipop sticks, medium sized saucepan, a candy thermometer,\nsome baking spray, and some lollipop molds. Now let\u2019s put it all together. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna do is take\nyour black licorice and your baking scissors, and we\u2019re gonna cut them to look like little\nmosquitos to put inside our amber. So I\u2019m just gonna cut off the end, boop! And I\u2019m not making them look perfect, I\u2019m\njust gonna cut a bunch of little slices, doo-doo-doo-doo! To make little creepy bug legs. These little guys are so small, so just do\nthe best you can, doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, and we\u2019re gonna make one for every lollipop. Before we mix everything up on the stove,\nwe are gonna grease our lollipop pan, you can use Crisco or shortening, I\u2019m gonna\nbe using a little bit of baking spray, so that it doesn\u2019t stick! Now let\u2019s head over to the stove and make\nour candy. Place your medium sized saucepan on the stove.\nThen add your light corn syrup, water, and sugar. Turn the heat onto medium and whisk\ntogether until the sugar is dissolved. Once dissolved, raise the heat to medium high\nand let the candy mix sit until it reaches 300 degrees. Keep a close eye on it because\nthe heat rises quickly. Then remove from heat and add the flavoring,\n1 drop of orange food coloring, and 1 drop of yellow food coloring. Mix together until evenly combined and then\ntake everything back over to the baking station. Now we\u2019re gonna pour our candy mixture into\na measuring cup for a little bit more control. I\u2019m using a glass pyrex with a little spigot\nat the end. Now we\u2019re gonna fill our lollipops. Once you\u2019ve filled them, take your little\nblack licorice candy, and place him down. And then use a toothpick because the candy is still\nhot, and press him down, just gently. And then you\u2019re gonna take your lollipop\nstick, and place it in. And remember, you\u2019re only gonna put little\nbuggies into 1/2 of your molds, because the other molds will be the back. And now you\u2019re gonna\ndo this to the rest of your lollipops. Once your lollipop trays are filled, now we\nare gonna let them cool at room temperature, just let them sit here for about 40 minutes.\nAnd then, we\u2019re gonna pop \u2018em out. Once your lollipops have set, now we\u2019re\ngonna pop \u2018em out of the tray and stick them together. I didn\u2019t have one of those fancy 3-D Molds\nwhere the lollipop comes out all together, I just had this little neat tray, so, use\nwhat you got! Slides right out, right on! Oh and look at\nthat! And now we're gonna pop out the back. If you\u2019re just making these for yourself\nyou can just lick \u2018em and stick \u2018em together, but if you\u2019re going to share with friends,\nwhich is what I\u2019m going to do, you can take a little baking brush and a little\nbit of water, paint a little bit on the back. Boop-bewp-bewp-bewp! And stick \u2018em together. Now you\u2019re gonna hold them together for\n10 seconds, or you can hum the Jurassic Park theme song! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hmm-hmm-hmm! Alright, there we go, and I\u2019m just gonna\nstick him into this little foam block, and then you\u2019re gonna do that to the rest\nof your lollipops. Ta-da! Here are our Jurassic Park inspired\nAmber Fossil Lollipops that we made today. I hope you guys enjoyed them. I am so excited\nfor another dinosaur movie! Uh, if you guys can tell, I kind of love Dinosaurs! I\u2019ve got these 2. I actually moonlight as\na Jurassic Park scientist, a couple nights a week, and I used one of these mosquitos\nto make these guys. You guys didn\u2019t know that, now you do, boom! Also, a side note, is that some of the lollipops\nare completely sphered, we\u2019ve attached the backs, but if you didn\u2019t want\nto wait for those, to dry and you just wanted to eat \u2018em, you can also just leave\nthem as a little 1/2. I\u2019ll be posting lots of pictures of these\nyummy Jurassic Lollipops on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter, and if you\nguys make these, or any other Jurassic treats, please take a picture and send them to me, I love seeing your baking creations, I just get a big kick out of it, it makes my day. And if you have any other ideas for any other\nNerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do\nmy best to make it happen.

Croix so today I'm sharing these easy boozy rum lollipops with you the first thing that goes in is a quarter cup of rum then 3/4 cup of sugar 3 tablespoons of corn syrup or Lyle's golden syrup and a pinch of salt swirl it around so everything gets absorbed cook on medium heat your sugar syrup will begin to pop clear bubbles then eventually turn a caramelized bronze amber color your candy is only ready when it registers at 300 degrees or when you dip it in cool water it hardens it should be set and never sticky lastly with the heat turned off swirl in a half a tablespoon of rum eaten either film molds are free pour them just like I showed you in my last heart candy video for flower candy lollipops these aren't overwhelmingly boozy but please keep in mind that all the alcohol content does

"u_LXG8yXDRM": "hey everybody welcome back this is Sarah and today we're gonna be making some lollipops with this lollipop maker the set is from sweet treats Lane and you can make up to 25 lollipops this set is for ages 8 and up and I found it at my local Toys R Us for $29.99 hey how your ready for today's tip of the day it's a candy joke joke the joke is what do you call a cow that can't Moo I'll let you show the answer at the other video so move on down to the end here is everything that comes inside of the box you of course get instructions three different flavors of candy pellets you get green apple strawberry and blue raspberry to decorate your lollipops you get some candy stars here are some lollipop sticks and if you want to give them out to your friends here are some plastic covers to put over your lollipops a silicone mold tray and here is the paddle and which you use to put your tray into the oven without burning yourself to use this properly you slide your mold right into the grooves of the paddle here's what the lollipop maker looks like on the front there's an on and off switch and then at the top there is a indicator letting you know whether it is okay to open up the oven door or not at the top of the oven there is a super cute candy design so now that I've gone over everything it's time to make some lollipops you could only make three lollipops at a time so I'm going to put three of my paper sticks inside of my silicone mold now it's time for the fun part the candy in this first section I'm going to put in some green apple candy pellets on top of the green apple I'm gonna sprinkle on some of the stars in my second mold I'm gonna put in some strawberry candy pellets and some stars on top in my last mold I'm gonna add some blue raspberry and stars to that one too you can definitely mix flavors when you're making your own lollipops but I want to keep them separate this first time so I can tell them apart by taste my oven is plugged in but is not preheated you won't be able to open up the oven door if your oven is at all hot Ingold my candy molds I'm just gonna switch my machine to the on position and wait about 20 minutes for my candy to melt after about 20 minutes you need to shut the Machine off and let it cool down before you could take your candy out there isn't a timer on the machine so you'll have to use a clock in your home or like a stopwatch as you can see for the molds I probably didn't add enough candy the candy shrunk a little bit on the molds and let's see how they came out this first one is actually pretty cute I love all the stars in the lollipop my strawberry one didn't come out quite as good as the first one I probably need to add some more candy pellets the same goes for my third one I could probably add more pellets now and put them back into the oven to make a better looking lollipop however I really want to give these a taste test let's try the blue raspberry one first oh I really like this flavor this is a really good flavor lollipop alright let's try another one here's the strawberry one hmm very subtle on the strawberry taste I definitely like the first one a lot better I'm going to give the green apple on a shot not too bad I'm not usually a green apple fan but it's pretty good I noticed that my toy store that they also have a refill kit available for the set however they don't have any different flavors at the moment they just have the strawberry blue raspberry and green apple flavors available hey again here's the answer to the joke of the day the joke was what do you call a cow that can't Moo the answer is a milk dud hmm I love me some Milk Duds that was a joke overall I thought the set was pretty fun and it worked really well in making my lollipops it does take a little bit of practice to know how many of the pellets you need to put in to the molds in order to make a decent looking lollipop in all honesty this set is probably a little bit of a high price $30 for what you get so if you really want to get it I definitely would wait for a Toys R Us coupon or maybe for the set to go on sale well thank you guys so much for watching this review I hope you liked it if you did please give it a thumbs up and we'll see you guys in the next video", "aDsrOZqHNng": "[Music] different types of strawberries there's a strawberry park area SPP for nearly every season and a would

need is two cups of sugar and you'll need 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup 1 cup of water and a pivoting spoon of salt some coloring some flavoring and some sticks ok few other things and I'll show you that as we go along ok so first I'm going to add the water to my pot and dimension if the edge of the teaspoon of salt in there and 2 cups of sugar and my corn syrup corn syrup the secret ingredient and candy-making okay I'll bring it over here and hide watch it it's going to stir it around I can't do thermometers ready to go in but it's not going to go into really the sugar tenses on so we'll wait a moment a few minutes and then I'll show you putting the candy thermometer in what it looks like okay then it's ready to put the thermometer in when you when you lift out your spoon and you look at the liquid and there's no little grains of sugar you know that it's ready to have that the monitor print okay Molly to the bulb of mom should be underneath the liquid we're going to wait for it to get to 300 I'll stir it only occasionally very carefully okay that's all okay I'm preparing the aluminum foil for the lollipops I have some sticks just little sticks I'm going to put a little teeny bit oil and shiny very very thin coat and then if when I place the lollipop sticks that I work this was one that long so I'm going to put the lollipop stick down so the part that's broken is it's going to be inside the stick okay so I'm going to do it this way so one lollipop will be here and one will be there and then I guess my homie there here that's it okay okay so this reached 310 degrees and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of color this is red color because I want these are going to be strawberry strawberry lollipops Australia this is too and we will also add lollipop trays want to see what color this is coming out to not quite it's not going to be very bright red but strawberries are really a great red that should be good enough and we'll add a little strawberry this is strawberry oil and you can get this a cat candy supply store and I always measure first into into the lid and it's sort of hard to know if it's really going to be right because it's hard to taste it went so hot but um you can just hope so he smells good but it's better to have it be a little less flavorful thank you favorable because of the aftertaste of the oils okay and then it's just a matter of pouring your lollipop on top of your hmm I think you said this way and you just not sometimes you try to reevaluate it's going to be a pretty big lollipop if you hold it still in one place that it helps make it more help to make it round okay okay well that's good thank you so much for joining us well let those close and you will see you put in effect in a moment you can also use your lollipop if you have to go to your candy supply store they have special molds that can handle very high heat okay and you want to spray it a little bit with some a little bit of oil okay it off a little but you can just pour lollipop right in here [Music] fill up your squares that you can try to fill the squares up better okay now what you can do is you can take your okay and just go back and forth fill up all the little fill up all those little holes then when you pop them out it will they'll break okay now what you want to do is wait for the candy to cool and then you'll be ready to turn it over and pop it out okay so this is our strawberry candy and we're just going to knock it out okay and result this is one just wait you'll have little pieces of strawberry candy okay and then we have our lollipop our lollipop sir come right off tray just enough mmm very good that's my lollipop now thank you very much for joining us and we'll see you soon bye", "HnUZbSMQRfo": "hi everybody are you guys doing new camera new setup new lights same hands same business dawg are you making some little candies today this is what they're gonna look like they're like three quarters whatever you can use them for wreaths ornaments candy Garland's birthdays any holiday you're gonna do them in two colors you can do them in three colors yeah I don't know if you could do them in four that seems like it might be pushing it but you do you I'm using this sticky back foam right here you can use any kind of sticky back foam you want or even any kind of foam you want because I got this just because I thought a general and that's the only place I could go at the time and you come six one inch pieces of this and you pair that with another color and you can get six of these and each sheet is 20 cents of 40 cents you get six of these little candies that you can stick up sucker sticking like a lollipop sticking and wrapping plastic you can do whatever you want so you don't need the sticky back it's quicker it's easier it's a little neater but you can buy regular foam cut it and then just hot glue it together all right so let's get started to put these over here how much you guys could see all over here cuz it's like mostly clean been doing I've done orange and black I've done this kind of green fluorescent yellow green in black and I'm gonna do black and purple so I got my cutting mat down and this is something you don't need but if this is something you have go in where is this thing oh it's right there in the shape shape cut by June Taylor this is used to cut fabric into strips very easily very efficiently and very quickly I used it because I'm terrible at measuring things and cutting and you know so what you're gonna do is if you can see down here quick quick little tutorial there's these little notches and the six button on sets go in six across here we need to cut our strips at one inch and since that blade does not want to fill it in the first time I just go together you get six trucks like in seconds this is super handy if you I use this when I was like strip piecing things you know cuz you need a lot of like two and a half inch pieces of fabric these are not like this ones hanging over just a little bit so it's not perfect but it's not gonna make a difference hang it up over here where it goes because now it has a place instead of just being thrown somewhere we've got our pieces it's gonna make six candies in total and these are very easy to do especially if you have this feedback phone right here and here's a one by its 1x9 right so how we're gonna do this I'm gonna have to move my camera if I go whether it is too weird I'm gonna unpeel the back like halfway and we want these doubled so I'm just gonna fold it in half trying to get it fold it as neatly as possible and I kind of did like assembly line on these I cut all my strips folded all my strips glued all my strips together meet all my candies and then glittered everything so there's half of our candy right there and you can see it gets kind of like it's not straight don't don't work with that I mean I did obsessively into the poem over just like I have just got to get over this have your garbage can near I see you not just throwing stuff all over the place because then your mom will come over and she'll yell at you and say oh my god what's wrong with you with the black I love the way this stuff smells and I think it's a phone because I bought some oh I bought some regular foam from Walmart a while ago for a different project and it it has the same smell but this one smells a little bit stronger but it's also a little bit cheaper like the stuff from Walmart doesn't have all these pores in it I don't know if that's gonna you can't really see that scale it's just like a it's not a texture but it's just like it's got little pores in it pretty much alright so we've got our two pieces I'm gonna grab me a clamp from right in here this is a little dollar tripping lamp not necessary when you zoom in a little bit I've been doing these with my low temp glue gun in my office this is a high temp I'm sorry both should work this one might just take a little longer because you have to hold it longer because it's hotter it takes longer to cool but it's also stronger so we're gonna see what happens all right I want to make sure that my folded edges are both up or down or you know just keep them consistent and I'm gonna put just a tiny little bit of glue right there it's just the tiniest then I'm gonna stick this on top and pitch it together this is not what the clamp is for but if you want to just clamp it and move on to another one you can okay so I'm switching to green on that one dries so this is what you have I need to do yo y'all gonna have to bail with me while I get into this camera gig y'all this is what you have it's just glued together right there nothing special rounded sides on the top cut sides on the bottom and to start forming this this is how I do it I'm sure there are ways to do it but I was making I was making my bigger ones and I will you sing like a hole glue stick and I was like well that's not gonna work that's uh that's not good so I have some little straight pins right here they're about an inch so if you don't have those you don't need them if you have them try it out and see if you look again I said this is what we're gonna do I'm gonna put a little bit of glue right here a little bit of glue right there take this and fold it over and it's gonna feel a little funky not funky but it's like it doesn't want to go that way and it doesn't so we clamp it and we tell it to go that way and you're gonna get seepage out of here like it's just unavoidable with the low temp glue gun you can go back afterwards and just kind of run your run the tip over there and it kind of melts it so that white disappears but I'm covering with glitter I was arriving my glue gun over the scenes where the glitter was just because it was bothering me it doesn't bother you if you're gonna cover the glitter don't worry about it today we're gonna do the same thing again except this time it's with this one and this is why I wanted the low temp glue gun and I thought it worked would work better because you're going to get glue on your fingers like it's just unavoidable okay we're only using this clamp in the beginning because it's so small I mean you could probably use it with a pair of pliers instead of the clamp but give you life we're gonna clean up the glue that's seeping out as we go I don't really need the clamp anymore all right so to conserve glue and my patience this is how I have it it's starting to form that spiral I'm gonna hold it in between myself in my forefinger like this my forefinger index finger is that called the forefinger or sometimes did I make that up just now yes great let's buy the glue here wrap the black around and under a little tight if you want don't pull it too hard because it will break gotta go here and here you could put it across that whole thing you could turn it and glue everything but again I want to go fast I want to go cheap I want to go easy like me on a date okay so this is gonna end right here so before I do that I'm gonna see where it ends naturally I'm gonna just stick a pin in there now hopefully this is spot where you have in piles a bunch of glue it kind of feels like and what this is gonna do like this side is all glued and now this side has a pin holding all these layers together so it's not going to come undone and when I'm closing these I'll put a little tiny tiny bit of glue and then rub it out with the tip of the glue gun just so there's not too much squeeze out hold that there the exact same thing a little bit of glue wipe it out and hold it down now looks like we can actually clean this one off gonna come in again but will I stay in it wow that looks good this is still cooling a little bit let me show you one that's been cleaned up these are done the exact same way this one has a pin in it you can't see it but it's made with the same foam cut the same way glued the same way but you can see the difference between these two see how this one's kind of shiny that's where I melted the extra glue on top with the tip of the glue gun going in I think if you held us here like it would definitely start to melt but I'm not holding it we're just kind of grazing over it lately no pressure don't touch the trigger okay and now we have one that's kind of shiny but we don't see any of those white blobs and give it a second see with the low melt glue gun I was able to just turn it over squeeze it and it was basically dry immediately now this one I did pretty good on because there's only a little bit there's always gonna be a little bit of glue showing in the middle we see that without me zooming in and out there's a little glue right there goes a little right there we think now I'm just gonna go in it takes like a second cuz that tip is hot yesterday it's all gone there's a little piece right here she's just using this to remelt the glue and clean of any debris all right and here's a paper plate you need this brand I believe that it's great that you make this brand who cares this glitter though I find this is essential this is from Walmart they are 97 cents a tube whenever I see them I buy all of them because this is like the glitter you want to use when you don't want to be garish about something I don't want iridescent I don't want different colors like I don't want to do I don't want to paint on a little thing of glue and then only do this I then only do this I just want clear glitter that sparkles but is not iridescent or holographic anything like that so I have some in this little baggie I'm gonna use that that's right here I'm using Mod Podge on these which serves double purpose it's going to obviously hold in the glitter when we put it all on it and if there's any section of this like see this right here you can't really see that but I can I can move that because there's no glue right there and the pins there's a pin like right here so this little section if you wanted to it could be messed up like that so when you put the Mod Podge on it's gonna go into all these little things and essentially glued the whole thing together like a top coat and I'm gonna have to apply this very technically then I gotta get my good tools over here okay I like doing it with my fingers because I want to get it in all those little grooves you want to use a brush that's up to you I'm just into using my finger wish I had rough table yeah but whatever and now I'm just going to throw some glitter on let's see I cleaned up and I don't have anything to what my hands on cause it's gonna do like that and come back press it in a tiny bit there's a little candy and it looks it looks a little dull right now but that's because there's glue in between the little things I get old clear up it'll be fine [Music] [Music] [Music] of course the glitter is gonna cover a glitter covers all manner of sentence [Music] [Music] like flip it dip it and flick see that one's got a lot of glue one that you can see it looks almost all away but once they're done they will be beautiful and sparkly this is this is one with three colors did I use the same yeah I mustard you just can't go yeah three colors you can do that it's a little harder to start them but that's where you would definitely need to click for so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope that this video file is not seven hundred

howdini and today we're going to talk about chocolates chocolate and kids first let's talk about chocolates dark chocolates has a lot of good things for your health and lately we talked a lot about 60% 70% 80% what is that percentage basically what that means is how much are our chocolates from the cacao beans is into that chocolate this chocolate is a 60% cocoa contents 60% of that come from a cacao beans the rest is sugar and a little bit of licit in perhaps sometimes some milk also for milk chocolates so now I tempered that chocolate and I'm going to show you how to make lollipops kids can do that with you it's a fun thing I have some mold that came from a company called life of the party you can find that into the internet I put some chocolate bottom into those mold let me show you a more little bit closer here this one so those mold are almost disposable they are not very expensive and what we do we put chocolates in here and the battle in here we don't put any fat or anything into the mold chocolate will crystallize and shrink out of the mode naturally so just keep your mode very clean that's the most important so I put a baton like that the next step is very sample take a piping bag and if you don't want to use a piping bag you can use a spoon take the chocolate with a spoon and drop it into the cavity of the lollipops you go little bit faster with those piping bag put the chocolates into the bag just like that then squeeze the top of the bag and the last thing that you have to do is to put the chocolate into the cavities here remember to put a little bit of chocolates on top of the bottle just like I do remember to temper your chocolates all the time otherwise the chocolates will never come out of the mold then you have to give the lollipops with the mold the next step for that going to be going to tap those molds so take them all on your hands by tapping those mold very slowly like that the top became very smooth okay so now I'm going to put those mold into a rack and then are going to leave them into the refrigerator for about ten minutes so ten minutes pass and the chocolates are ready so the first thing that I want to show you is when you turn the mold you will see here a little place where the chocolate doesn't retract yet you see it's a little bit darker but I know that by pulling the the bateau here they will retract completely you see it opening in front of you here up that's it now the mold is coming out so basically what's going on here is that the chocolate crystallized the chocolate shrink a little bit and how that happen is when you male chocolates the molecular fat will break down and then you have to put them back together now remember that you can do different color you can put white there this is a gift this is a little snowflake so you can do a lot of different things with it then you can put them into a little bag put a little ribbon around it and those are beautiful gift to give to the family to the front of the kids to the school and they are pretty fun and easy to make eat a lot of chocolates is good for you I am Jacques Torres for howdini thank you", "vUtA3HafLNg": "hi today we're going to make some sour apple lollipops using two different types of citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching", "cCtUQTYZYJY": "hello i am bonnie now i'm eating sugar it is so big i would like to do any sugar asmr hope you like it please like subscribe thank you this uh so me you uh uh", "Dow5DOJKo_o": "[Music] when I was seven years old I took a trip to the bank with my dad and the bank teller offered me a lollipop and my dad always told me you know you shouldn't have candy because sugar is terrible for your teeth so I asked him well why couldn't make a healthy lollipop that's good for my teeth so I could have candy and it wouldn't be bad for me my name is Elena I'm 14 years old and I'm the CEO and founder of Zahle candy I wrote out a plan in my idea binder and I watched videos on YouTube on how to make hard candy than replacing it the ingredients with sugar-free ingredients that I could find and then I tried to make candy at home and that did not go well at all my parents weren't too happy that I ruined about half of our appliances in the kitchen after that I realized you know I can't do this by myself I'll need a manufacturing facility a team of food sciences to help me create this product I also talked to my dentist about what I could use to create the teeth cleaning aspect we put together a pretty solid ingredient list including xylitol in our effort all we did hundreds of taste tests and I had my friends over pretty much every day of the week okay I have this candy for you to try okay I have this candy for you to try and believe me they didn't sugarcoat it that period took about two years before we were even presentable enough to take it to a retailer but our first retailer was Whole Foods we pitched to their buyers and they absolutely loved the product which was really really nice to hear from there we got into amazon.com Kroger Target Walmart and most recently CBS and Walgreens so that's about twenty five thousand retailers just in America last year we nearly tripled in sales doing about 6 million at retail this year were on set to nearly triple again doing about 10 million at retail we're in about nine countries right now but we're continuing to grow every day we are adding lollipops to our Sally worldwide map and we are just growing at an exponential rate [Music] so basically a shipper display is just another way of advertising the product instead of either having it in trays on shelves or having it pegged on shelves you just have a bigger footprint in store which is always lots and lots of fine well I cannot take credit for coming up with the name lollipops my little sister Lola actually came up with the name we were all sitting around the dinner table and I was like hey Lola like you want to try the new xylitol lollipops and she was like oh you mean as Ollie poop and I was like why didn't I think of that but it was so perfect so we're a family-owned company me and my younger sister Lola are the majority owners we all work in the business on a day to day basis really everyone that works in the office is just a team from the start we've always been a cause based organization during my initial research I found that tooth decay is actually the single greatest epidemic facing kids in America today which brought about our nonprofit which is called 2 million smiles and give free lollipop stew kids through schools across America to Jesus about the importance of oral healthcare and that's just a really an endgame goal for us we can have every kid in America have a clean mouth a healthy smile and his only Bob balance has always been that something that you know I look at and I'm like how do I do this some days but I also have a great support system of people always kind of reminding me like oh you know you're you're still a kid you have that math homework due tomorrow like if you want to do something enough you just make it happen I'm Melina Morse I'm the CEO and founder of Zahle candy and I'm a mini vocal", "4GVAGmaSmXs": "okay so today we're going to be making lollipops it's very simple and easy way to make lollipops using things that you can find in the shops and around your home so the basic ingredients are as follows to make this the equipment you're going to need is the first step is to put our sugar and our cream of tarter and our water into a saucepan then we simply heat it up and stir until all the sugar is dissolved now the cream of tartar is an interfering agent that will stop sugar crystals forming and hopefully leave us with a nice clear glossy lollipop at the end okay so our sugars are starting to reach a stage where it's bubbling at this point we want to pop in our sugar thermometer and turn the heat down slightly we don't want our sugar to get really hot and burn the temperature that we're looking for is hard crack and it's approximately 152 degrees Celsius now if you don't have a sugar thermometer just heat it for around 10 minutes and take little spoonfuls out as you go along and drop it into ice cold water what you're looking for is the sugar to set very hard very quickly and then be snappa ball and that's when you've reached the correct temperature odd crack what I'm going to do is take a spoonful of the mixture out and drop it into cold water now the way that it behaves once it hits the water will tell you what stage you're at if you don't have a sugar thermometer okay so just going to take a teaspoon out and drop it into the water at the moment we're not even at softball stage so it just forms a blob at the bottom and if we then stir it you can see take some of that out it's kind of just a gloopy soft sugar syrup okay so it's now reached the temperature that we're looking for and I'm going to demonstrate that by taking a spoonful and just dropping it into this cold water okay so we're just going to pop that straight into cold water and what we're looking for is for it to set hard and basically crack and it's setting in the water and when we take it out it should crack so I'm gonna take some this out it's set nice and firm you can see there and if you try and break it you'll find that it just breaks down to lots of little pieces so I'm going to pop in my yellow food coloring now a couple of drops should be more than enough try not to stir it too much at this stage because it can cause the sugar to crystallize and set very hard very quickly and then you're not going to be able to make your lollies so we're just going to get some oil onto our piece of freeze proof paper just to make sure that our lollies don't stick so we're now at the consistency we're looking for it's runny but it hopefully will hold a bit of shape when we put it straight onto our sheet you get a spoonful of the mixture just going to pop it on to our sheet there making a circle as we go just repeat this mixture should make about twenty dollies now before your mixture sets you want to make sure you take your lollipop stick just press it down as the back your lolly with a little twist and that should make sure it gets completely incorporated into a mixture so I'm popping the stick in pressing it down and just gently twisting it from side to side until the sugar covers the whole stick you can keep your lollies for two to three weeks off the day you've made them and for storing them you can need to put them making sure they're not touching between layers of greaseproof paper and airtight container and that's how to make one pops", "IiXh5RF0tpY": "hey guys this is the nursery from creative travel repeat since monsoon is here I've come up with these yummy treats for your little ones when they're going through some sick days and sore throat this will only soothe them and the best part about this recipe is it doesn't have any fancy things like candy thermometer or gelatin or any fancy ingredients it's completely basic made from something which is already there in your house so let's begin first mix one cup sugar with 1/4 cup water keep mixing till it dissolves completely you might need a helping hand to once it's dissolved add 1/3 cup honey and mix it well now put it on a medium flame and let it boil for 15 minutes to check if your candy is ready to be poured into the mold with a small drop of your boiling mix into ice-cold water and see if it hardens into a crystal like hard candy if it doesn't like in the previous video then do not pour it and in this one you can see it's completely hard like a crystal takes only a few seconds for it to go from golden brown to burning so be quick start pouring it into the molds quickly you can use lollipop molds or any silicone molds if you don't have any moles you can try out this droplet then you the solution like this on butter people I'm out of butter people so I'm doing this directly on the kitchen slab and I had only hope it comes out well you can see how quick you need to be these drops harden before I could I just stick to them because I was obviously busy recording the video here I'm trying to do all them from the kitchen slab but it's a little harder than butter paper if you crack like that and you came out well best way to cheer and soothe the little ones during sore throat things now for wrapping them up you can wrap them in any dips paper I'm using transparent paper the crucible tube tops are so beautiful and I want them to be seen that have been tightly around them and you can store these pops in room temperature in an airtight container for about fifteen to twenty days", "46JzCnMKnOQ": "hi it's rocks Rock and reviews and Emily is here with some new candy it's called the

fans by rocking fan", "TblXlvNOXxE": "how are you doing this Martin from garin's for life the weather is a little bit rough out here but I wanted to make a quick video on our strawberries we grew 12 different varieties this year and one of them we had for the last 10 or 12 years actually now from our original allotment actually back in 2009 I think it was and we added on about 11 more strawberry varieties now and we wanted to show you which ones of them actually good croppers which ones have the best flavor which ones are not worthwhile growing here in Ireland or in cold temperate climates even including the UK some of them are definitely better than others so I'll just show you we were growing them in these crates we also have them grown in the garden in wood chips as well so we'll start with the standard varieties I actually have to check the labels because there's so many of them these ones here as you can see they're already suckering very well that means they are making baby plants here you can see and same as these ones so some of them actually seemed to start so green wilder fruiting which is not really ideal but it's okay we're going to just plant these out and we're going to try to eat whatever fruits we can often what before we do see that here even that fruit now that'll be ground so we've been eating so many strawberries now we're getting about probably 10 to 15 strawberries per day every day off these 12 trays now it's a really good one I just want to even make a record for ourselves to see which ones are actually better than others symphony is just variety here and it's definitely a really good one here is a better one so the name of the varieties symphony and try that 1/3 sweet a little bit tart just perfect and we had it's a heavy cropper we've got a lot of strawberries just off probably about a kilo maybe a kilo and a half just off these five plants here and there's one crate this one here we have not seen as many strawberries from it which is sweetheart is the name of the variety but it's a good one I'm still not as heavy a cropper as the symphony that's for sure this one here trying to read the labels greenies I read Queenie's we actually had very little very few strawberries coming from this one so it's not a good cropper for here anyway this one here is pretty good elegance is the name of this one and it does produce quite a few big berries some of them actually produce less berries but you can see that one actually hasn't started to sucker or make baby plants which can be a good thing depending on where you have them set up and so this variety here what's the name of this one here sent an Aussie is the name of it we got a fair few berries off this one they're definitely smaller but they're pretty good now this one here is Snow White I remember because it didn't actually do too well the plants were absolutely tiny Snow White doesn't seem to produce quite as well as any other variety I wouldn't really bother with it it's kind of a novelty variety though so just for that reason it's good to have this one here is Pegasus which is actually my favorite one because the berries are sort of small as you can see here but by God the flavor is something else so they are kind of like it tastes a bit like wood like the original strawberries wild strawberries or wood strawberries for strawberries so much more intense than any other strawberry my favorite one Pegasus I tidy recommend going for that one and they fruit for a long period of time as well most of these actually seem to have fruit it for the last four to six weeks but somewhat improved for longer as well this one here is very late we try to keep moving Malvina is a very late fruiting variety but we'll see how it does it's also suckering already which just is not really desirable because you know it's producing fruits at the moment and it's already put in some of its energy at least half of the energy in to grow new plants which is not really ideal especially because we're not ready to put this out into the garden for these to actually grow you could put them into pots as well these city roots coming off them here but not up high here on the tables anyway so nuts these eight varieties so we'll move over here now and we'll take a look at theater for one of them we actually had originally and you'll see it's actually a really good cropper this one here now what's the name I don't want vibrant is the name of this one really good cropper I have to say some of them have been a little bit damaged by the birds as you can see this one here is kind of gone rot and I won't eat that now but it's a really good cropper vibrant is definitely one that produces an awful amount of berries look at that ooh we missed this one oops better not leave that around here look at that one so let's see how this one is oh yeah that's a good one that's a really good one now you remember we got a lot of fruits just from these five plants here in this one crate I'd say we got about kilo and a half of this one at least maybe even two kilos here's another variety that we don't actually know the name of so we've been growing it for the last 11 years now and we brought it from house to house and we've got lots of these plants so if you ever see strawberry plants in our gardens that's usually these ones so let me try it that's a really good one it's very sweet very flavorsome no sourness at all no tartness so um it's a really good one it crops or anywhere as you can see it does not soaker early which is ideal so especially when you keep them in these crates on the tables close to your back door where you can keep an eye on them and the birds might not take as many of them but most importantly you get to eat strawberries everyday which is the way you should do it rather than you know leaving them only checking on them every week or every three or four days that's not often enough you should really keep an eye on them every day let's check out what is with this variety here called this one here is called Florence Wow I was actually not impressed with Florence previously about a few weeks ago but it does seem to be cropping now very late in the year now this is actually more compared to the rest of the strawberries anyway you can see there is some here let's try it so Florence must be obviously from Florence in the Toscana in Tuscany in central Italy I presume that's where it's from no not a lot of flavor try another one I thought they weren't gonna crop at all in Ireland I didn't think would actually work as a variety to grow here maybe they need more heat Wow different flavor entirely from the rest of them not as sweet that's for sure and a little bit less flavor would not sour at the same time distinct flavor though yeah it's still a good one to have put not a heavy cropper I would say this one here Cambridge favorite it didn't do that well here I don't know why I put it should do really well you can see here we're still getting some fruits here which is cool I mean actually strawberries don't have to be strawberries do not need to be fully red to eat them they're actually it can be very sweet as long as the seeds the seeds themselves actually are far apart that means the strawberry grew quickly and it's got a lot of water in it a lot of juicy yeah lower juiciness mu that's a little bit flowery it's actually not very juicy we'll try another one we'll try this one here not a lot of flavor not a lot of sweetness but we'll give it another try next year and we'll see how it goes so there you are now that's 12 different straw varieties of strawberries hopefully it will help you along in choosing which ones you'd like to grow yourself and definitely work fruit work while growing because you get so many fruits offered and it's basically free because you get more plants every year and you'll have them forever and you have fresh strawberries that come straight after plant straight in your mouth we grow them out the back here at the back of our house and our little boy actually goes out here and eat some more or less every day because picking them himself and eats them thanks for watching and if you like the video please give us a thumbs up it helps us out a lot and that way on YouTube and on Facebook the video gets to get seen by more people thanks very much bye bye now [Music] you [Music]", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more

"3yo_BXa0kVM": "hi everyone today I will make another popular Korean Street food using fresh strawberries it is called strawberry hard candy or turkeys a tongue in Korean all you need to do is simply melt white sugar and cover the strawberries with it we can make great and unique party or snack food in Korea dessert skew world like a kpop I will show you an easy way to make it at home rather than the typical way you see it as a street food obtain 20 million sides the fresh strawberries wash them good white the strawberries with a paper tower to get rid of any remaining water it is important to get all of the water so that the candy will stick better to the strawberries optionally cut the stem and leaves off obtain 26 inch member skewers put the strawberries to the skewers one by one it is better to use foam strawberries for these because when you cut the sugar the strawberries will stay on the skewer better alternatively you can put about five strawberries on each skewer in the case you will only need four 9 inches course this is the way you typically see these strawberries as Street food obtained on empty cardboard milk container poke some pin holes into it or score the cut board with a knife so that they can hold the skewers while the sugar is hardening space each hole out far enough to allow room for the strawberries push the skewers into the horse make the holes the same number of your strawberries viewers in a small saucepan add 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of water stir it until the sugar dissolves cook on medium-high once you start the boil cook for 5 to 7 minutes or onto the sugar thickens depending on your stove temperature the time can be different this is a little tricky because of the temperature and cooking time the syrup can become too hard or soft we want a crunchy texture so to check if the sugar is done this is my secret when the sugars start to become thick dip a toothpick into the syrup and then immediately dip it in cold water the texture of sugar syrup should be changes immediately try it and see if that's the texture you want for your candy if it's not hot enough it longer if is hard enough turn off the heat things should be prepared ahead of time because the sugar syrup will become hard very quickly divya strawberries into the syrup and roll them to cover them with the syrup evenly [Music] if there is nobody near you to hold your coded strawberries use them make a box to hold them for you while they harden if we just put the candies on a plate they will stick to it and the nice shape will be ruined if we want to make skewered ones instead of one per square to order syrup onto the strawberries using a spoon you have to do this step very quickly and it is a little tricky to copper them evenly you can use different kinds of fruits such as pineapple Kiwi grapes and so on I just wanted to show you an interesting way of eating your fruit but personally I think it is best to eat fresh fruit without any sugar this can be a little dangerous for kids to make because the sugar is very hot the sweet and crunchy outside along with the soft and furry inside make them very delicious enjoy and yeah right now but I need a plain old you go help okay hey what you mean totally grouchy I come and check oh yeah Wow tried it the waiting place ha oh good job [Music] [Music] thank you for watching see is no game bye", "wKHaFj1T8Lg": "*Galactic Music* Corinne: Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video.

racer drink mix so these are the they call them singles to go a lot of times all refer to miss blenker packs just because and that's what anger caused them there are water enhancer that's a very pretty pink package these were a dollar each at Dollar General and hopefully watch the other review that we've done on the star bars we reviewed the fruit punch cherry and lemon and I don't remember what my verdict was about which one was my favorite in that video but I can tell you since then the lemon is just it's absolutely phenomenal I love it and for a dollar apiece you get six sticks they are five calories per stick so old how it does it so strawberry drink make strawberry almost was like oh it smells really good yeah it says now you can enjoy your favorite Starbucks flavors and a refreshing beverage with six sticks in each box you can hydrate with a quick and delicious drink in your car during work or wherever you go and I always keep a couple of these in my purse as well because we don't go out to eat very often but when we do go out to eat I don't like to pay three dollars for a coat because I'm cheap and so I will ask for a glass of ice water and I will add one of these flavor packs to the ice water and if there's nine from soon whatever on the table that's what I use and people have said well do they say anything that's the surface say anything or no I've never been asked any funny questions or anything because I can add anything you know I I want to add a flavor back to my water I can't and it's delicious so we're gonna try they all pay first I love the company I feel like we're having a baby shower here yeah we're having a gender-reveal party yeah you can do that take one of these and pour it into another little pouch maybe I you have put in a paper envelope or something and pour it in and shake it out if you can see the powder though that's bad thing I love the flavor hmm oh sorry it is it's very nice now you like that we've sent and we sent in the previous video you can put it in these bottles or you can pour it in a glass our glasses are almost as tall as this but they must not they're not quite as tall because I've tried to pour ball the ball of water in there nice and there's still a lot okay because we have regular tall clear glasses and Kevin put one of the other flavor packs in that water and he said it was almost really strong so really the amount of water 16 this is 16.9 ounces this is really the perfect size that's what they're made for yeah they're made for a bottle of water so if your glasses aren't quite that tall then you might not want to use all the powder it was way too strong so I ended up kind of drinking that it was it was very it was almost syrupy how strong it was and this is blue raspberry and it does have that blue that raspberry flavor you know what that'd be good in what pops oh that would be a very good pops up on yeah I agree you know these and what can you make absolutely good yeah if you had those trays that Union the Dollar Tree make your own popsicle you could totally for their wiper pack in there shake it up that's what people make now already yeah and pour it into those containers you could use these I've never thought about using these to make those popsicles yeah but you had walked it it probably would be nothing you can get a whole packet of kool-aid for 89 cents or some right and make all pitcher of cool right the bloom raspberry was good it's not one that I would want all the time which is fronts because you love I do love raspberry I agree with you that someone I'm going all the time but if you drank if you mix it in with your other ones flavors exactly exactly so you're not gonna yeah I wouldn't go through like a whole like that lemon I would do the whole box yeah you drinkin one outfit yes and it's like when I add these to water a Kevin agreed we drink them twice as quick your office is we do like the clear American water from Walmart because they're so sweet and they have so much flavor that I do drink a lot more of that I think that's offering faster than I drink water too right so water is just boring so but even the clear American I would rather have these than the clear American they're so delicious I love them so out of these my choice would be the straw okay yeah but they're both really good it's just the strawberry one I could drink every day every day what we talked about the raspberry I wouldn't want that every day I could drink it but I wouldn't want it every day no are these five pillars of yeah five calories apiece yeah so I don't think that's bad at all so hopefully I'm helping Walmart or get them we've looked at Walmart I looked at one Alexa to me yeah cinamon Walmart yet so we have only seen these in the Dollar General so if you've seen them in a different grocery store let people know where you saw them and because I would love for everybody to get to try these so I hope you enjoyed the video and

lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go

[Music]", "SHMsnBnAeTk": "welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida for pouring our hot sugar today and it's already flavored with strawberries and cream flavoring today we're going to do something a little unusual we're going to make spiral lollipops but instead of making them in the traditional round shape we're going to make them in a hearty shape we have the color and then we stir carefully to boil all the water out we don't want any water left because this will make the candy stick while it may look like we're adding more sugar here or not we're adding citric acid most fruits have an acidic content to them and our flavoring doesn't so we need to add it back in the citric acid may only be added after a certain point where the candy will be too hot and the acid will burn leaving a lousy taste in the tasters mouth the candy that was against the table and the bars is now cooled down a lot but the bits of the center is still scalding hot wave to mix the candy together to make it get to an even temperature so we can work with it as the candy changes states it goes from liquid to semi solid to more solid and eventually it gets solid enough that we can put it over a hook and fold it again and again until it becomes white the sugar starts as a deep amber but as we fold it over and over we trap millions of air bubbles and it makes the candy become a brilliant white each one of those little air bubbles acting is a mirror to reflect the light it's time to assemble the candy and we're going to move the candy to a temperature controlled surface that will slow down the cooling of the candy to give us time to do our assembly we're making red and white stripes the white stripes are there to reflect the light through the red stripes to make it look more jewel like if you want to order our candy you can try it for yourself and get it at our website WWE Network now that we have a big log of candy we need to get it down to the size of a rope so we can spiral our lollipops we do this by pinching off one end pulling out a log slowly and then pulling out rod by rod until they all are right to turn into lollipops we twist the rope making the pattern go around it and then we take the rope and we make it into a spiral the heart-shaped lollypop starts as a traditional circular lollipop then the lollipop gets passed on to the second candy maker the second candy maker takes the candy and puts it into a steel form which they press it into the shape of the heart they then take a wooden stick and insert it into the candy making it into a lollipop if you ever make it to Tallahassee to see us make our candies live here at lofty pursuits you can also go to our website wpri.com", "2k7dVLr0Zio": "hello everyone I've been making candies suckers for a couple years now I usually make them real spicy with either habanero pepper or ghost peppers from the garden but today I wanted to do something different I'd like to try to make some bourbon flavored and another batch with absent won't follow me in the kitchen and see how these turn out all right I'm back in the kitchen now I'm gonna do the Bourbon first and I'll put all the ingredients and measurements down in the show notes below I'm gonna start off with a quarter cup of bourbon here punch get that on the leg then I'm gonna add 3/4 cup sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt I don't have a heat all right the second I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on but I got it put in three tablespoons of corn sugar all right that's in there and then two tablespoons of water so you can get the jar open or the bottle open there's one and there's two get that out of the way now let me go ahead and turn this guy on it's a little noisy but I set it for right what is it for 25 see if that'll do it we want to keep stirring this until against to 300 degrees when this thing gets to 300 degrees I'm going to go ahead and shut it off and then add one more teaspoon of bourbon and then pouring in our sucker molds so we'll just let that sit so it comes the tongue and I'll be checking the temperature with one of these the thermal meters then infrared thermal meters they look pretty good we can actually shoot it in then out and it's 99 we're locked on 99 degrees [Music] okay we're about 240 but another sixty degrees that go and I have some food coloring that I was gonna put in here but I'm only gonna do it to the absent just maybe one or two drops so for a lesson Green nothing for the burger looks like there's a nice brown haze hood anyway we're past that 3-headed marking go ahead and shut it off not only about 1 teaspoon of bourbon there we go and do that just that an easy stir there okay we're ready to pour our mixture in the a molds all right let's see if we can't do this without messing up it's a little foamy [Music] a little bit more [Music] I didn't add in the food coloring like I said so they got a natural amber color which is perfect and I'll have to wait till these cool all the way since I don't have enough molds to do the absent flavor now absent I think it's going to be really good it should be able to get that nice licorice taste along with extra sugar huh all that foam went away not getting a lot of bubbles so when I tried the absent I'm gonna let it cool for a couple minutes maybe that was my problem in the beginning it was too hot all right this is gonna be it [Music] okay we made 24 suckers with that recipe there all right I'm gonna do some accent suckers now so just like before the store quarter cup of absent the pre-op Davis was a Pharaoh corn syrup all right let's start his night and last time when I did the burden I was stirring it the whole time I reread the directions on the Loran oils you know like peppermint cinnamon they used in regular candy I reread the directions and they said don't stir it I just let it come to a boil at 300 degrees or until it reaches beyond their degrees so I screwed up the first time so now I'm just going to stir it until the sugars melted and then leave all alone and this time I am going to use the food coloring I'm going to put a couple drops of neon green in there this induction cooktop here is pretty good it gets the temperature pretty quick okay looks like all the sugars are melted so I'm just going to leave it alone so it gets the 300 and now it's 170 508 if about 260 and I know if we're just doing the regular suckers with that no alcohol soon as he gets around 260 and jumps right up to 300 pretty quick okay we're getting close we're up to 90 the whole spots in there 300 okay go ahead and kill the heat for another 1 teaspoon of absent the cheese spoon and then okay and here's our food coloring I just put two drops in there that's it make sure this rule we put a total of five drops in by having three drops just in all right these guys in the mold now there's that foam again now I make a little mess a little bit [Music] [Music] I don't think I'm going to make as many as I did last time last time the Bourbon we've got 24 suckers looks like we're gonna get 24 all right we're done I tasted both of them had a lot of defects so I had to eat all the defects the Bourbon I definitely would not do again you can't really taste any of the Bourbon so that was just that that wasn't a big waste there's only a quarter cup but I would not do it again and absent definitely gonna do it again it doesn't have a real strong licorice taste but there just a subtle but it's really good so definitely gonna do the absent again but not with any type of bourbon and remember on that bourbon I was stirring it the whole time don't do that I can see a little bit of bubbles in the Bourbon once and I think that's what was caused by me stirring it or constantly stirring it with absent I didn't like the directions said stir it until the sugar dissolves and then leave it alone until it boils and then just keep an eye on it to against the 300 and pull it add your food coloring and one other teaspoon of absent or whatever you're doing you know if you're doing brandy bourbon the absent cherry yeah a cure whatever it is at the very end take it off the heat and if you're going to add some color go ahead and do that and add one other teaspoon of that liquor to it all right hope you enjoyed it and if you like this video go ahead and subscribe right up there the round one is

I've actually done one I'm a couple subscribers keep asking me what are my favorite strawberry juice is now for me you guys know that it's not typically in my go-to type-a juices but I do like some strawberry juices so I decided to share my top ten with you guys so a lot of those I do already have for reviews for so anything I have full reviews for I will list it down below because trying ten juices on camera is a lot and I'm not trying to get Nick down so I'm gonna go this year my favorites with you um my top 10 favorites and will vape a couple because um there's actually two I believe I don't have four reviews four so one of the first ones I fell in love with never thought I'd like a strawberry babe is pink haze by bait milk I did review a couple other flavors from them and I really really liked it it is a great strawberry cream type vape Oh smells so good it reminds me of a pink starburst but um yeah and not only that you get 120s 420 2.99 a great deal I do have a full review all set down below so that's number one I'm not going in any particular order because I decided not to ranks I'm just letting you know the ones I like the next one I have also reviewed for is a crush now this is a strawberry and pineapple so it kind of I like pineapple but pineapple can be really acidic so I think the strawberry cuts it really really really nice and you definitely get both of them you get more of the pineapple on the inhale and on the exhale you definitely get the strawberry is actually out of the three flavors a review for them my favorite and I really do enjoy it alright let's go ahead and have a bathe and I'm gonna let you guys know what I have in my tank currently right now I have the brothers a vape killer rabbit this is a strawberries and cream they really really enjoy and I have that inside my limitless Plus tank so let's go ahead and have a vape so good it is not a candy strawberry what whatsoever it's a very ripe strawberry with cream really really like it um it's if you want more of a like a rich custard killer rabbit one is a strawberries and custard and where this is a strawberries and cream so the next one is from the propaganda or the hype collection from propaganda this is a strawberry shortcake if you guys seen this ice cream this has made favorite ice cream when I was you know growing up to get from the ice cream man and as soon as you open it up it smells just like that now the one thing I had this does taste like a very ice cream eat strawberry it doesn't taste like a fresh or candied and very the cream now in order to bring out like that crunch factor of this I do suggest vaping at higher wattages but this is from propaganda and again that is the strawberry shortcake really like that as well alright the next one is from one of my favorite companies which is premium vape supply this is their premium line if this is strawberry melt if you like a good strawberry this is one definitely not to pass up on it's so so good you get a sweet ripe strawberry with a hint of cream on the back end that's really really really nice very rich something you can still aunt they all day but really really good and great value with that as well alright the next two are so super similar I could've sworn I was there I had accidentally dripped the wrong thing so a couple weeks ago I reviewed the new max VG line front or the high VG line from space with Jam and this is meteor milk this is a strawberry milk exactly that really really nice smooth an inhale clouds for days but recently I had picked up from verdict favors the convict they had some special going on and in online where you basically paid for shipping you got the bottle for free to try out their line so couldn't pass up pass up that deal so I picked it up and these two are almost identical so if you are a strawberry milk fan if you've tried the Space Jam you're gonna love the verdict vapors and vice versa they are both great juice is very very smooth very creamy I love both of these they're like a more creamier version of the the pink haze from vape milk so really really like these as well and then the last ring we are actually going to go ahead and taste because I like them so much I just really want to taste them again so the first one is going to be from drop dead vapors you do have a full review it will be down below but this is strawberry pink champagne what surprised me so much about this juice is not only do you get the strawberries but you get that kind of fizz from the champagne in it and it's nice it's not alcohol way at all you still get that nice sweetness to it and again the fist to me was the most interesting part of this juice I got this on my little boy at 40 Watts at a point 3 build on top of my last of my 1 so nice you get that tartness from like the champagne taste it's almost like you got the fizz in there and it's a perfect strawberry not overly sweet very very ripe really really like this one and it does really well on Laura wattages sometimes with some juices I find that you got to crank up the wattage in order to get all the flavors this one isn't one of them it's a nice local company out of North Carolina so always about some supporting the smaller companies really really enjoyed that so the next one we're going to try another great juice that I discovered the line from is splash babes they brought out this called flash bracket and supposed to be reminiscent of a 1950s diner milkshake and you're definitely getting that is totally they're really really really liked it all these I'm vaping at 3 milligrams and again any review that I have for these which all these are have reviews for I will list them down below as well this was my favorite from the entire line right there it's like if you were sipping on that homemade milkshake that they make in those blenders with it you know the steel cups so so good the creaminess is there the strawberries there definitely a faith and last but not least one of my favorite strawberries that I've tried in in the last couple months this is from Hometowne vapors this is a strawberries and cream kettle corn and you're probably thinking what the hell is strawberry doing with kettle corn but I've noticed that companies that use the kettle corn you use it more for that calmly type saltiness and I don't know but it works it just works these bottles are very very affordable they're standards or 50 mils and not 30 mils and this one is called red dream if I'm craving a strawberry ejuice this is the one that I've been going to lately it used to be pink haze but again this just is so unique and so good that I just truly enjoy it it brings that strawberry to a whole new level if you like a caramel on kettle corn or kettle corn and you like strawberries and cream for some reason you mash them together and they are just heaven if I had to write one that was number one it would definitely be that it's just absolutely fantastic I wasn't gonna rank them if I'm going to I guess my top three out of the top ten would definitely be hometown vapors red dream pink haze by bait milk and killer rabbit my brother's baby those are just my top three but then again they would have made my top ten I have tons of ejuice and I will tell you picking ten was a little different difficult but I wanted to share the ones I found that if honestly if I tell you to if you're a strawberry fan you get them I think you'd like them but then again taste is completely subjective so hope you guys enjoyed this I know it's a little bit long on the video but I really wanted to share the ones if you're looking for a good strawberry juice and we're looking for something maybe a little different and out of the norm these are the ones I would choose so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up let's share your favorite strawberries down below for other people who may be looking for some other ones that are available in their local shops or ones that you know I didn't mention so although not have you guys are having an amazing day or night whenever you are watching this stay tuned to the next video and until then beep on", "U2y-n04VZXA": "hello food fans and hello to the food fans to whom I forgot to say hello food fans in the previous food video do they even will have a treat show you how to eat strawberries this is a one pound container of strawberries and these are huge strawberries I'll get to these one-pound containers and one is the regular strawberries the other is the organic strawberries and I don't really know if I could ever tell the difference in there you see if I can open this real fast and I'll show you how huge these strawberries are these are almost watermelon size so we'll get started on how to eat a strawberry but first of all I will do is I will wash the strawberries before I slice them to get ready to make any serving of strawberries and we might even use some secret ingredients so let's get started until we get to the secret ingredients the strawberry has a lot of nutritional values vitamin C has fiber yes potassium and it's loaded with antioxidants I'm just going to slice these up as I said these are big strawberries I'm going to you have only five of these strawberries and we need something to add to that what can we add to strawberries to make them taste just a teensy-weensy bit better I heard somebody shout shortcake Shortcake is good of course but angel food cake is a my secret ingredient that is even better than shortcake open this lid on the angel food cake angel food cake was priced at leave four dollars and twenty-nine cents see here turn this right side up four dollars twenty-nine cents so what I'm going to do is use a small amount of this probably I could get I could use 1/4 of it if I wanted to make a really big meal buzz use about 1/8 of this angel food cake here as a bed a cushion on which to lay these great big strawberries so they can get a rest on their bed this looks nice perhaps they're getting strawberries they have lots of nutrition and some angel food cake but there's more we will add more strawberries of course and I'll slice up all five strawberries here we have enough strawberries there to feed a large family or a small army I'm gonna put a little bit of powdered sugar on it here or secret ingredients but that's not all add something else I will sprinkle a few chocolate chips on this not really a lot just a couple of pennies worth perhaps and we will put something else on there as well put some pudding on there but I won't be using chocolate pudding since I've already got chocolate chips in there I will use the this is cafe oka pudding I will add this to the dessert now it has pudding on it we shall add two more secret ingredients before we begin to eat and enjoy and one of those secret ingredients some chocolate syrup this is a somewhat expensive dessert but if you're serving it to a lot of people it's not too costly per serving but if you eat like I do yes it comes in off this does make a good dessert very good tasting dessert for when you're having pizza spaghetti any kind of Italian food or fried chicken potatoes and biscuits that looks pretty good right there I'm gonna add one more thing and dig in in place of the pudding we could use ice cream or yogurt this is the whipped cream Milky presence is there something like ice cream it's also quite cold like ice cream doesn't that look good of course it does we're going to get started here and enjoy a dessert fit for a king and is a big scoop of good tasting dessert good yes this hits the spot great dessert very very tasty the chocolate chips add a lot to that I will go ahead and eat all of this at once Irving that's how you eat strawberries this is probably enough for four regular people after a meal such as slice a slice of pizza or a few slices of pizza and as much of this as you want this tastes great thanks for

What?? No!!! Ever wondered what your face would look like\nas a giant lollipop? Neither have we, but we found out anyway. Firebox is a London-based company that makes\ncustom lollipops the size of your entire face. We know, it\u2019s a dream come true. All you gotta do is submit pictures of yourself\nthrough their website and BAM, they\u2019ll send you the candy version right back. Here are the pictures we sent in. You open it. I\u2019m scared. I see black on the lollipop so it must be\u2026 Oh my god! No!! Oh! You don\u2019t see a surprise then. No!! Why do I look 40?! What are these old-ass wrinkles? I went from 24 to 44 real quick. They cost a whopping $57 each and take around\n2 weeks to ship if you\u2019re in the U.S. \u2014 but they\u2019re hand crafted, so you can\u2019t be\ntoo impatient when living the couture dessert life. As terrifying as they are, we have to admit\n\u2014 the attention to detail is pretty impressive\u2026 Aside from the fact that my lollipop looks\nlike she\u2019s 45. I\u2019m trying not to take it personally. I still look good. CUT TO OUR PRETTY GLAMOUR SHOTS! We wanted to see how convincing they really are. Which was not at all! But we had a little fun around the office\nanyway. So we get that these lollipops are meant to\nlook like us, but the REAL question is, how do they taste? This is a part of Alex\u2019s ear from a candy. Can you eat it and see what it tastes like? Sugar? Does it have any flavor other than sugar? Is it fruit? It\u2019s some sort of fruit. A peach! Peach. It tastes like peach candy. It\u2019s actually not bad. What does it taste like? Like peach. It turns out we actually taste pretty good. It doesn\u2019t just taste like sugar \u2014 which\nis honestly a relief because I could, and would, eat my entire face. So are these really worth the hefty price tag? Probably not, but if you had $57 to drop on\na big-ass lollipop, this could be the perfect treat for you. You\u2019re getting more than just a giant sucker\nthat looks like your face. The minor details are pretty on point and\nwould make it a great, unique gift for someone you know. Just make sure you send in a flattering picture\nof them. In conclusion, this big ol\u2018 lollipop is extra AF, and we can\u2019t really tell you if dropping\n$57 on a sucker is worth it. But if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, then go for it!", "h53AKwAqL7E": "hey there welcome to another edition of DIY Friday I'm your host Liana Halldor for Halldor homes here in Sacramento California we're right in the midst of flu and cold season so I wanted to show you a quick and fun remedy you can make at home for those persistent coughs today we'll be making honey lollipops these can be used for stirring into tea eating on their own or as a little Getwell gift I especially like these if you have little ones as a lot of cough syrups are not safe until age six let's get started here are two tools that will help this project go a lot easier first I've got my candy thermometer this is really gonna help you gauge when to stop boiling the candy so it is just the right texture for the lollipops the second is my favorite measuring cup for measuring sticky things like honey what's great about this product is that when you pull the cup down you just fill it with the sticky liquid and then pop it right out no mess start with adding 1/2 cup of sugar 1/3 cup of honey and two tablespoons of water to a stainless steel or aluminum saucepan with a wooden spoon stir ingredients gently so there are no splashes on the sides of the pan turn burner on to low heat and stir until all sugars dissolved about 5 minutes now attach the thermometer to the pan and let sugar mixture boil on medium low heat until temperature reads 295 degrees Fahrenheit or the hard crack stage while candy is boiling place a sheet of parchment or wax paper on your preping surface to help with any spills when pouring the liquid place the sticks in the molds make sure you are keeping a very close eye on the boiling liquid as you do not want it to burn or scorch as soon as it hits the correct temperature take the pan off the heat and add the lemon juice or extract ginger and cinnamon and stir well pour the liquid into the mold slowly there may be bubbles so you can go back over the unfold once once it has bubbled down once the molds are filled push the sticks to make sure they are fully coated and leave to cool at room temperature once lollipops are fully cooled you can decide if you want to store them or give them that way as gifts place parchment or wax paper on work surface peel lollipops out of the molds and place on the paper if there was open flow gently tap the lollipops with a butter knife and it should flake right off lollipops should be kept stored in the airtight container to keep them from getting sticky layer parchment paper or wax paper between each layer when storing if giving us a gift is clear good fats as rappers [Music] tie your ribbon around the bottom to keep the wrapping airtight incorporate a fun lug to give with the gift add some tea bags to the

is for you", "gRRQJPLGArk": "[Music] guys I'm here again with another DIY for my kitchen and this is the fabric lollipop you can make these as large as you want I'm going to show you how to do this this is a very inexpensive adorable and an adorable punch to your Christmas sweet kitchen meet me my craft room I'll show you how okay so to do one large lollipop let's see I'm just gonna measure I'd say it's about 2 and 1/2 yards of this for one again I'm making this big also you can buy these different widths this is a real thick one they come even smaller and I'll probably do a couple small small ones just to show you but let's get started with this one so the first thing I'm gonna do is you're gonna take your hot glue on the tip of this and you're going to put well this is the way I do it anyway you can do it whatever way you want but I'm going to glue down just so this end is already covered okay [Applause] and then you just start winding it what you start winding it whatever way you want okay and make sure when you're winding it that you I wondered in an angle okay like you can see now you can start putting hot glue a little bit I don't put it all over just certain spots but you want to make sure that you're covering in other words you don't want to go like this trying to show you you don't want any of this exposed okay but you don't want to overlap too much because then it's just gonna be too much material and there's no reason to you know use up that material by just overlapping it too much you just want to make sure you're covering enough of the piping to where you're not gonna see it [Applause] okay this would be adorable too for a little girl's room if she had like a candy-themed or oh I don't know or a playroom or for a baby shower think about a baby shower you guys and put big bows on the sticks also let me tell you I didn't even tell you um okay so what you're going to need is you're gonna need your material your piping your dowels and I got these at Walmart I think was well it doesn't have the price it was only a couple dollars and then your hot glue that's it that's all you're gonna need for this so if you see I'm winding it at an angle down but making sure that I'm covering the next piece okay so now I'm just gonna randomly put a little bit of hot glue like I said not on every round but just so it's adhering a little bit every now and again okay and this does not take long you could do this watching television very easy you could make some of these for a birthday party you could make some as a bouquet for a friend [Applause] with a gift card maybe you know what I mean these are you'll see what I mean once it comes together it's very cute [Applause] so I'm gonna keep rapping and then before I start putting it together I'll be back because there's no sense of me just having you sit here watching me wrap this whole thing okay so I have it wrapped okay and I'm getting out of dehl now I'm leaving my Dells natural I want them natural but you if you want you can paint them you can wrap them with ribbon whatever you want but like I said I'm leaving my natural okay so now what we have to do is we have to start wrapping this around to make the shape of our lollipop now this is where you will use the hot glue more okay some people you want to get this tight too some people will go to the even to the point of sewing in between these I don't I'm just going to glue okay so I'm just going in to the between the crevices of where I'm boiling it around [Applause] now you'll see why you need more why you use so much because like I said this was two and a half yards right one doesn't go far once you start doing this and make sure to keep pushing this down so it doesn't start coming up to a peak you want it to lay flat it's a lollipop right I just hold it for a minute [Applause] and you'll get the feel of it you know when you should glue and when it's okay not to and put the glue in enough to where you're not gonna see it I mean sometimes you can't help it but if you can [Applause] just take your time be patient with it let the hot glue dry and as you see I put the glue and then I pull it a little bit and then hold on to it hold it against that last part and remembering to keep pushing down to keep it flat [Applause] I think these are cute when they're exaggerated meaning big you know whimsical looking you're seeing it now right [Applause] this would be adorable for a little girl or boys birthday party in the theme the color of whatever you know the birthday is or if you had like a carnival theme [Applause] cute I love these I really do these are so cute [Applause] and like I said what you could do is you could just be watching TV and wrap these and then the next day glue them you know you don't want to do this if you're tired as far as glowing [Applause] should always have cold water next to you when you're glowing in case you burn yourself [Applause] I just want to make sure that that glue is pushed in tight because you don't want gaps [Applause] and I like making these in threes when you're putting them in a display so I'm gonna go around finish it off and I'll come back to put the stick okay so I have it all glued together okay cute and now you're going to take your stick and decide which side you want to be the front all right so now you're going to glue it now what I do is all glue right about not in the middle a little bit below the middle okay but I'm going to take a little piece of material after I glue this on just to help secure it but first I'm just gonna glue okay [Applause] and then I'm just gonna press down being careful again because that glue can come up on you I've had glue where I've glued my finger and I've had to peel it off real quick and had skin come with it yeah you don't want that so keep your little bowl of ice water [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that could even use really I could use yeah you go well it just helps to secure plus it finishes it off [Applause] and what you could do is get longer dowels if you wanted you know depending if you want them to be different heights or you just put this stick down closer if you want [Applause] I've got paint at O my hands look awful sorry but that's the life of a crafter right okay there you go how adorable is that oh my gosh now all you do is put a ribbon on and I'll get some ribbon when I finish the others to show you and then I'll show you where I'm putting this okay so I have all of the lollipops done okay what I'm gonna do I'm not going to do any more than this because I have others that I bought from that I bought from Hobby Lobby so I have three of the bows already for this I'm gonna put bows down here I was going to put a smaller ribbon I didn't like it so I'm using this really cute and I think it's very whimsical this game like I showed you so I just folded it like you saw then here now you can use wire or Chanel stem I'm just using this game ribbon and I'm gonna come here and short go even now like the two different sizes of gingham it's cute so I'm going to just flip that out this is wired which is nice okay and now we're just going to glue them and I did try to just tie this ribbon you know how you would tie it I did not like the way it looked it was too bulky it just didn't look right to me so my glue gun heated I can't see which bows because I made them different sizes blank down better put the glue on okay these were so much fun you guys and like I said you can do these for any occasion these would be adorable for a little girl's birthday party or little boys they would be adorable baby shower what about a baby shower you look cute in the kitchen okay [Applause] [Applause] okay I'm gonna glue the last one and I'll be back no okay guys so here they are what do you think I think these turned out adorable so I will be showing you where I'm putting these so you'll be seeing these in my home tour for Christmas and you'll see where I'm gonna put these in my gingerbread and peppermint kitchen guys I hope that I've inspired you to try this yourself use any kind of material you can use them for any time it doesn't matter what the holiday not a holiday whatever you want it can be a birthday it can be a shower it can be a holiday it can be or you just want to decorate with a candy theme whatever the case I hope I've inspired you and until we get together again remember the world's a better place because you're in it don't ever ever forget that there's one you and you brings something to this world nobody else can talk to

tomorrow bye for now", "a1icutJ42pg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everyone its Lara from our early house comm and today I'm going to show you guys how to make a healthy lollipop and this recipe is in perfect timing for Easter if you follow me over on Instagram you saw my stories that me and my kiddos were working really hard on coming up with this recipe it took us several different tries to finally nail down a sucker that would pop out of one of these molds and it tasted good when it gets close to holidays I like to think of things that I can kind of recreate so they can stick to a more clean eating healthy lifestyle even during the holiday time but I don't like them to not be able to have all the fun things that kids have and so I know in a few weeks when it's Easter time there's gonna be a lot of candy and suckers and things like that and so I thought I would try to come up with a recipe where they can still indulge in suckers but not get all those food dyes and refined sugars to make this sucker we are going to be using coconut sugar and honey as our sweetener so because it's still going to be really sugary it's not something that you want to give your kiddos all the time but more for a special treat but at least it isn't refined sugar and it's a much healthier option than giving them store-bought suckers so to get started we are going to turn this on about medium heat and then we are going to bring the ingredients that I have here which is coconut sugar honey and apple juice to a hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit so I am going to pour in I have 1/2 a cup of coconut sugar and I talked all about coconut sugar and the different benefits of it over on the blog if you're interested then I'm pouring in 1/4 of a cup honey and then I'm going to use two tablespoons of apple juice now if you don't want to use apple juice you can just use water that will make the suckers turn out just fine I just thought if I added in some apple juice it would add a little bit more flavor okay so I'm going to let this come to a boil now I'm going to stir it a few times and check it with my candy thermometer until it reaches 300 degrees now this part is crucial if you don't stir it often enough or if it goes over that 300 degrees then your sucker will taste burnt and if you don't get up to that 300 degrees it will not solidify and turns hard like a sucker and believe me I know we messed up multiple times so make sure that you have a trusty thermometer and now you keep an eye on this because the temperature that you get it out is definitely crucial but other than that this recipe is foolproof and it's really easy to make while this is warming up I'm going to prepare my sucker molds and by preparing I just mean putting the stick in you don't have to grease it at all or spray with anything once they are hardened the suckers pop out really easily I found these sucker molds on Amazon and they are adorable these are two of the molds that came with it actually has three more designs that it came with and it has little circles with swirls in it and flowers I think there was smiley faces stars and hearts so these are super fun because it makes the suckers and all different types of shapes which the kids love and the other thing I really liked about these molds is that they came with reusable sucker sticks so these are little plastic reusable sucker sticks and they just popped right into the mold and so I'm going to push these in now and then we'll be ready to fill these when our liquid is ready [Music] [Music] after you remove it from the heat and kind of stir it a little bit let the bubbles go down I like to add in some essential oils for flavor so you can do citrus oils are really good we are doing wild orange today you can do lime I have tangerine we've done lemon all of those kind of make a fun lollipop for the kiddos and so I am doing about 15 drops here of wild orange and that just makes it taste super good now we're just going to pour it into our molds and then you're gonna let these sit for about 30 minutes or until they are completely hardened and then you can pop them out and let the kiddos enjoy them [Music] [Music] last week I shared a recipe for some healthy Easter jello so if you guys missed that video I will link that down in the description below and if this is your very first time by my channel I would love it if you hit that subscribe button I get out new videos every single week on essential oil education healthy recipes and natural remedies thank you so much for stopping by [Music]", "MuxjpnmqeI4": "it's time for your your bank's 12 hi everyone today I'm going to show you I'm going to call it a demonstration rather than a tutorial because you need these particular molds to be able to do this and I know that some of you may not be able to find them these are for Halloween they are witches fingers and there's some eyeballs and what you do is you fill up the little molds with the candy melting wafers and then you can put a sucker stick here and then you have little suckers when you're done so I'm going to show you how to make these and what I would suggest is you take a look at your local craft stores if you have a bulk barn which is a bulk food store in Ontario then you may be able to find them there these are the sucker sticks they come in I think there is a hundred in here and they're from the bulk barn and these cost two dollars and forty nine cents which is fairly reasonable so there are the sucker sticks okay we're gonna do the eyeball first we need white red much Brown and I'm going to make blue eyes so we need blue these are candy melting wafers they taste a little like white chocolate is what they taste like and they're especially designed to be melted and when they harden in a mold they're nice and shiny I bought these at the bulk barn however I know you can buy them online under the brand name merkins or in Wilton or Wilton and you can also get them at craft stores so I bought these at the bulk barn and I store them at room temperature in these little plastic containers now you can melt these in a ziploc bag but if you have some concerns about Ziploc bags and the fact that they may release chemicals into the candy and don't use them um I'm going to be making a couple here to show you so I'm gonna put some candy melting wafers in a glass microwave of a bowl and we're going to microwave and I'll show you how to do that so I'm going to put the candy melting wafers in here now the secret to melting these is to melt them at 50% power or if you don't have that on your microwave melt them on defrost mode so I'm just going to show you my microwave here I've got power level and I'm going to go to power level 5 which is 50% and we're going to start off with 30 seconds and we're going to do start and after 30 seconds we'll take a look if they started to meld we'll give them a stir if not we're going to do another 30 seconds this is after 3 30-second intervals you can see they're starting to melt a little so what I'm going to do is just take a spoon and just give them a stir because once they start to melt it doesn't take long give them a little stir just like that that's enough I'm going to put back in for another 30 seconds ok and we're good and once they're melted as you're working with them if they start to harden up not going to take long to get them melted again they seem to retain heat for quite a long time this is actually perfect consistency for dipping or for whatever you want to do sometimes they get too sometimes they're too thick if they're too thick and you need to add a little bit of vegetable shortening to it stir it around and it will thin it out and still be perfect for candy making so there we go they're melted in this bowl but I like to use them in ziplock bag I find it's just easier so I'm going to transfer the melted white into a ziplock bag and then just hold onto this bowl with a spoon and use it again next time you have to melt some if you have a whole bunch do go first thing we do start off with the very center of the eye which is going to be just a little bit of chocolate we'll just let it drip and then we'll just tap the mold a little bit and let it spread out and do the same thing with the other one okay now for the color part of the I'm going to do that in blue now I could let this brown harden first but I'm not going to because I'm just going to be careful like so and I know it doesn't look smooth but all you have to do is give it a tap and it's just smoothing out now what I've done is I put some red in a ziplock bag and to get the veins this is going to be hard to see but to get the veins I'm just going to fill up the little veins with the red like so and I'm going to go put this in the refrigerator not for long I'd say for 5-10 minutes to let it harden before we go on to the next step but before I do that actually I'm going to do a witch's finger might as well do a witch's finger I think we'll do a finger nail and read so hope you can fill it the nail bed now we're going to fill this with green and what it's just about full we're going to add a sucker stick we want to make sure it's further enough into the candy melting wafer so I give it a little turn to coat it and then put it in just like that and if you think it needs a little bit more to hold it in there we'll add it and then just a little tap you'll smooth out and you're going to put the refrigerator to harden so now that the center of the eye and the little veins are set we're going to add the white to fill it up so it's almost full and then we're going to add a sucker stick and I usually give them a little turn just to coat and you want to make sure there's enough of it to hold the sucker in place and then I add a little bit more it will even up and all the bubbles will come to the surface as well that's another reason why I'm going to tap it some light Tufts bubbles will come to the surface and then refrigerate again so once there's the really chilled you're just going to pop them on the mold and if they're cool enough they should come out quite nicely and they should be nice and shiny there's the eyeball eyeball and another witch's finger now to serve them you just put them a container and hand them out or you get these little treat bags they also sell these at the fall form and you put your little treat inside like so and then you can put a twist tie around here if you want or a piece of ribbon I mean I don't have any orange or black ribbon which would probably be best for this because during it's Halloween but just so that you get the idea tie it with a piece of ribbon and you can curl up the edges if you'd like and there is one little Halloween tree for somebody next one I make though I will let the chocolate ice enter Harden before I put the blue you can see how it they've kind of bled into one another the colors so I think I would let the chocolate harden before I put the blue that's the only thing different I would make I would do with these same thing with this one that the blue what you wouldn't see the blue going into the mid Center like that if I would have let the brown chocolate harden first but they're still cute and I'm still just as edible so here's one where I let the brown part of the eye harden before putting the blue and you can see how it's a lot nicer a lot nicer and there's no bleeding into the brown into the blue you", "CxKN-Aab3U0": "[Music] blippi and I was just dancing oh

this is Zander from Sandra kids and today I'm by myself because while I'm filming the Sandra is in Australia doing stuff with moose toys and doing off some videos so check out that stuff but I have here a blow pop lollipop shop so this makes your own blow pop suckers lollipops so I'm really excited to check this out it makes fifteen blow pot lollipops which is quite a lot and it makes the classic cherry and grape flavored so there's that's what they look like and then it's just easy steps you just load the candy powder into the mold you heat the molds in the chamber and then you wrap enjoy so it seems pretty easy actually so I'm excited to make them and oh yeah just for reference this is a real blow pop in real life so it looks like this and you unwrap it and so we'll actually compare the two to see like how I'll to compare their tastes and how they look to so here's a real one and this one's the cherry flavoured so we will get this on the box get it going and then we'll see if we can make some really good Bullpups all right here is our blow pop lollipop shop out of the box and all set up it came with lots of stuff so here's the machine itself there's like a little pressing mechanism here's the mold where the candy goes in to melt and then here's the melting machine part you can see it melt over time and then here's the lever and that tells us if we need to load it or if we need to cool it or when it's heating and then it also came with two bags of candy powders so we have cherry to make cherry one and a great to make a grape and then here down here it came with bubble gum so I thought we actually had to make mobile them but it just came with it and it's just blow pop bubble gum in the wrapper and oh cool so kind of like has little arms everywhere it's kind of like a star that's kind of cool and associate to cut this in half to make a better lollipop so we'll probably do that so the rest of this I can probably just put in our little we pop stand here to put to the side because we don't mean too much and then down here it comes with the rappers and they look just like the real rappers here's a real one so it literally is the reference to you so that's really cool and this looks for the cherry ones and then this one is for the grape ones so it's all purple so that's really cool and you just cut them they're made of like the plastic stuff and then it comes with a bunch of lollipop sticks here and it comes with a bottom mold with a little silicone and then top mold with silicone so that's really cool so let's get started making it the first thing we need to do we need to take this mold out right here and this is our bottom mold here and actually what we do first is we put the rubber bottom cat without the hole and the metal bottom cat so I've got the metal cap here and the rubber and there's no hole in it and you put it at the bottom of this and you want to make sure it kind of locks in place so there's like a it should just make like a little pop sound kind of like this what we do next is we got to put the candy in this is fill it half full with candy powder so I'll just fill it halfway here there we go and I'm gonna do cherry first because I think I like that flavor the most yeah that's pretty good and then next we put our bubblegum in and it says to cut the bubblegum in half for best results so I will listen to them and I'll just kind of cut it in half here with my scissors there we go okay so then we'll put in the Bubblegum here like that there we go that looks good and then top the rest off with the candy powder and we want to fill the top of it some kind of making a little message just a little bit off to clean that up a little bit okay so there we go you want it filled to the top with candy powder all right now that our mold is filled with candy we put it into our machine here and our mechanism and we do it until it care-a-lot and I think that's long because I just press down so I think it's locked in there pretty safe okay and then next we take this top mold here and it's got like a rubber top and a hole and we want to stick our lollipop stick through there through the bottom here and it says to pop it through and you want to make sure there's about like a 1 inch of stick in there so I think that's pretty much good okay I think it's pretty good and then now it says to put it in the track here I think this oh yeah here we go and then I can fit the lollipop stick in there and then just fit the mold like that there we go it's kind of like tricky cuz it's like there we go it's kind of hard to see okay so there it's all fit the stick is hidden in there like this and then now what we do is once the upper mold is there oh we with candy press in the race position okay now it's pretty easy all we have to do is move this from the center locked off we need to turn it to on and lock it and make sure it's on and now it's heating so you got to let it kind of melts in here and then it's got a wait for about eighteen minutes so it'll take a while so I'll leave this here and let it kind of like cook and melt and as you can see it's on the heating position and then oh yeah there's a little indicator it's red so that means it's heating so that means it's on and so our candy is just gonna melt in there after 18 minutes and then after that I turn it to cooling and you gotta let it cool and I press the mold so it kind of makes the lollipop so we'll just let it melt right now all right has been passed 18 minutes now and as you can see in here if you can kind of see it's like all melty around the edges and stuff so it's nice and gooey which is what you want so now what we have to do is press our mechanism here down and press the mold into it and make sure it's nice and tight like okay and then that's pretty good and then umm yeah you press it down and it'll make the mold make the lollipop in the mold and then now we move our operating handle to cooling off so like move it there and it says it won't let you put it back up until it's finished cooling off for like a safety thing which is kind of cool and then it says put it to the right and then let the machine call for 15 minutes so we've got 15 more minutes it's takes probably like 40 minutes just to make one lollipop so it's very more time sensitive I just recommend to taking a blow pop and eating it but if you want the experience of making candy this is fun it just takes a while for each one sup so yeah after 15 minutes we'll let it cool down and then we can take it out and then we can pull it apart and see what it looks like so we'll be back in about 15 minutes alright it has been over 15 minutes now and it does feel less hot so it should be safe to just take out now so loading off alright and now we can lift it the mold out of here and you can see the mold still it's a little warm but it's good enough for me to handle at least so ok there we go and then we can just take it down here and then let's see I guess we can just try to take it out of the mold here okay interesting okay and then oh yeah it actually is still quite hot so maybe I'll put it in the fridge it actually suggests that put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes to let it cool further and then we can take the metal clamps off and then peel it out all right our lollipop has sat in the fridge for a bit and now it's nice and cool so I can touch it and it actually just comes apart really nicely whew there we go okay so we can see the candy and I'm doing this over a bowl because it seems like it's kind of messy ASA we just have to like kind of carefully oh okay there's our perfect top here and then the silicone around it it says it's like almost invisible on it so you could just pull it off Oh Lou perfect alright that turned out really cool and then now we just have to take the bottom mold off oh there we go okay so there's the bottom and there's oh wow the sucker turned out really really cool it looks just like a real blow pop okay maybe even better because it's just so perfect looking and then we kind of just want to pull this bottom one off this bottom silicone and wallah look there is our beautiful blow pot it's like seriously like symmetrically perfect and then there's gum inside so I'm pretty sure it's awesome I just want to kind of taste it mm-hmm okay it does taste like a blow pop so now it's time to like wrap it up and for the final step it's time to wrap up our puffs of note pop so we have our wrapper here that I cut and we have like a holster strand of them so this is for the cherry the cherry is like your primary colors label so you want to put the lollipop kind of Shirish I think and then this you just kind of wrap it up like this I've never had to wrap one up I've always unwrapped them this so I don't know exactly how it works and I guess you just twist it like that click around the bottom okay and then you twist it again the opposite direction on top and then see I'm not very good at this oh yeah I think I made the label I cut a little short pretty okay I feel if I just keep telling myself that yeah there's our there's our lollipop it's a little more round than a regular one thank the regular ones are bigger they're more oval-shaped wear this one I made was more circular but they're pretty similar and I think the taste is really similar to especially in the cherry flavor so let's make a grape one real quick and let's see how that one turns out all right now to make our grape flavored lollipops so here we've got this I've kind of got this all prepped already already showed you how to do that and I'm gonna pour this with our grape flavored candy powder and it actually smells pretty good it smells almost like cotton candy it's like a city so this is for the grave and you fill it once again about halfway up fish I'm doing the silver bowl this time because it's way smarter to do it that way less mess and then we've got our stick of bubblegum right in the center there like that okay perfect and then you want to top it off but they can be purple beautiful great suckers okay oh this is why I have the ball because it prevents that okay so let's just kind of mold that off a little bit all right so we'll load our little mold here into our machine again and you got to put it in the hole here and make sure it pops like that so it's like locked in place and then I already have this set up which is our top mold part the silicone on top and the the stick and you want to lower this so that I can pop that in there right in place beautiful and then you want to leave that up actually and then now we want to push it down oh yeah actually we wanted to do the lever not put it down you don't want to push it down there you want to use the lever and go down and then turn it into heating mode again and our red indicator is on so that means it's heating up so then we wait and 18 minutes and then that will melt up and then once that's done we'll press it down all right it has been about 18 minutes or a little over that it is nice and kind of hot ish and then inside you can see our grape is pretty melty and sticky looking which is perfect so at first you want to take it out and then push down the mold first because you want to get the shape going great tight and then you want to put it into the cooling mode and you want to stay there for another 15 minutes to let the Machine cool itself down all right it's definitely been at least 15 minutes or so so let's do it the loading position here and then we load it out if it's placed and then I'll slide it out here there we go okay very cool all right it's pretty it's not too warm so I think I can at least take the top off there we go okay I was able to open it huh okay here we go here's our great lovely pump here I'll do it here actually let me do this over the bowl again because I do not want to create a mess and then okay so that comes off pretty well and then here's our extra candy over the edges of the silicone let's take this off the silicone was like you're super tight on it okay whoo there we go there is our blow pop grape flavor it's nice and purple looking and just the bottom didn't turn super get a kiss movie it didn't melt and on to that the rest of it looks pretty good the whole top turned out perfect sweet and there's it's crazy that there's bubblegum inside too but that's really cool so alright so I cut out a piece of our great label of low pop wrapper and now hopefully I cut this one a little longer than the other one so hopefully that works thing is some kind of glue to and they roughly said that's pretty much that okay tonight there is our grape flavored blue pop it looks a little different I don't have actually a real one with me but here's the cherry one took your parents eyes this one's around this is more oval yeah I literally just tastes like a great blood pop so that's perfect um here's that and here's our cherry everything turned out pretty good and I think this maker works actually pretty well considering it does take a really long time like almost an hour for each lollipop so be prepared for that but it does turn out really well and there's bubblegum inside too so if you guys liked this video and want to see more fun candy making videos or anything kind of fun like that please click like and subscribe and in the comments let

vanilla pop this was supposed to be pink the bottom part and it turned out orange so this is the way they look cut up and this is my second loaf and they came out okay I'm not as happy as I should be but if you can see by looking at this the mica didn't distribute very well so something I'm doing wrong and if any of you good suppers out there can help me figure this out I would appreciate it greatly and I mixed it with alcohol to break everything up and it just still left these little speckles everywhere which made the soap look like it's not colored properly but anyways I love it give

strawberry allergy do you even know why your body reacts to red strawberries here is some vital information strawberries belong to the rose family and are grown widely in temperate regions there are four varieties of strawberries namely wood strawberry beech strawberry meadow strawberry and a variety called for gary in Muscoda here is an amazing fact the seats of a strawberry are actually on the outer side of the fruit strawberries are rich in different kinds of proteins these are found to cause allergic reactions in humans our immune system has been designed in such a way that it protects any foreign substance from invading the body leading to allergies some of the proteins found and strawberries are identified as harmful to the body system and the immune system triggers off an allergic response at first consumption there may be no reactions but subsequent ingestion of the fruit can cause mild or severe symptoms the immune system has already started the process of producing immunoglobulin antibodies to neutralize the proteins repeated consumption of strawberries makes the antibodies stimulate body cells to produce histamine histamine causes muscle cramps thinning of the blood vessels research has not been able to prove as to why some people are allergic to strawberries while the others can relish it without thinking of the side effects but it has identified a particular protein which gives the fruit its red color is the allergy reactor these proteins are absent in the white variety of strawberries and people who ate these did not have any allergic reactions another fact that researchers have discovered is that people who are allergic to birch pollen have similar reactions to red strawberries some symptoms of strawberry allergies are hives rashes at keenest eye inflammation of the tongue mouth and throat runny eyes and nose abdominal discomfort vomiting and diarrhea anaphylaxis for people who are fond of eating strawberries for fear of allergic reactions there are certain tests which can be conducted by professional allergists a simple test is by scratching a needle with the strawberry allergen on a small part of your skin if you are allergic to it then that part of the skin becomes red and a small bump may appear after around 15 to 20 minutes you may experience some itch keenness - this indicates that you have strawberry allergy if you liked this video please share like and subscribe to our Channel have a nice day", "VfFmaCwmaBY": "hey guys today I'm going to be making a lollipop bouquet but this time it's not going to be a topiary it's going to be in a cool ice cream sundae dish so I got this in a set of four it's a six inch tall ice cream sundae dish it's a glass like a cobalt blue glass really pretty you can get these in clear I also saw some in like a light pink and some other colors but I really like the blue and I'm going to be using some the silly straws I think I'm going to do the yellow because I have the yellow tissue paper but you'll want to get you some foam balls unless you've got some styrofoam leftover from some packaging that you can cut down to size to fit into your your glass dish and you'll need some dum dum lollipops I've got this huge box I've also got some fit zero pops that we're leftover and I'm going to use those for the top to make a sort of like a cherry on top type of a look and some ribbon I've got a little bit of this happy birthday ribbon which is good because this one is for a birthday and then some that have the the blue and yellow balloon this is a three inch foam ball I got a package of six can see that this just plugs right down inside of this particular ice cream sundae dish that I have it may be a little bit too low into my dish because it really needs to be about like this in order for you to properly put your suckers around however I didn't have a four inch foam ball the other alternative I have is this five inch but as you can see it's going to be way too tall for me for what I want to do so what I am going to do is just work with this 3 inch ball I'm going to wrap it in this tissue paper and be pushing that into my ice cream sundae dish so that it actually will help my foam ball sit up higher but the yellow paper will go down in here into the dish to kind of offset some of the blue you don't have to have anything into the dish or an alternative is if you really want to get crazy with the candy you could put some Hershey's Kisses or whatever their favorite candy is down here in the bottom but you want to be sure that whatever you're using it if it's styrofoam or if it's these little foam balls that you wrap this in the tissue paper so that if you do have candies down in the bottom of the ditch you don't contaminate it with any kind of styrofoam or foam shavings that may flake off now wrap the styrofoam ball in the tissue paper and I have just set that down into the glass dish by putting this tissue paper on this 3-inch fall now this sets up high for what I need and it also fits nicely in the opening so I don't even have to shave anything down for this I've got some multi-flavored deliciousness going on here with my first tier of the dum dum lollipops so I've just put a first row of suckers here on the bottom but where the glass dish and the foam ball meet I poked them in to the side there they they have a little bit of a an angle going into the foam ball and you don't have to do that you can have them going straight in like even some of mine here are not perfectly straight or sloped I have them differing because as you put these suckers in this the stem of the sucker for the lollipop when you stick that in there you're going to be fighting with the rest of the sticks as you go along because these are you know it's a small area to put all these suckers in so you just have to kind of work them in however you can but for the most part I try to make them as uniform as possible now for the second row I'm going to take the dum dum lollipops again but everywhere that I have a space like right here I am going to pop another sucker and then go all the way around doing that with another row of the dum dum lollipops here is that second row of suckers and this is just some more dum dum lollipop like I said I was spacing it to where this next row of suckers would go in between the bottom two so that you have an even coverage it just makes it look a little bit better and then also alternate your colors as well because you don't want to put the same flavour right side by side and if it works out as you're going along that maybe you have you know two root beers diagonally then you can just change that out if you want to unless somebody just really likes root beer suckers and then you could just load it full of them on this open area here you can do a couple of things a video that where I got this idea to put this into a Sun a dish she used blow pops for the next row so that they would then kind of stick up more because the blue pops are large in size just like the Tootsie Roll pops and then her Center on top was these cherry flavored tootsie rolls I don't have any blow pops so I'm just going to make more of the center with filling in with some dum-dums and then I've got several here of these red cherry to SeaWorld Pops oh you can mix that up however you want to do it I'm just going to use a third row of the done dubs and now I'm going to put in my red 2-0 pops here in this area and then put the raspberry in the very center so actually what I'm going to do I'm going to go ahead I found the very center of that I'm going to go ahead and push this down and notice I left it really tall because that is going to be my cherry on top and to further the cherry aspect I'm going to fill this in with the red Tootsie Roll pops so that it looks like just one big massive mound of cherry the only other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take some extra suckers and just go around and anywhere I've got holes like you see I have a little bit of a little baby hole right there I'll pop another sucker in I did wind up going ahead and making a fourth row the dum dum lollipops since I don't have any blow pops I'm just going ahead and using those up so I wound up with it was 60 dum dum lollipops and all because once I made the additional rows of the Dum Dums because I didn't have any blow pops I then also went around and filled in any little holes which I did have some holes around on the bottom so I filled in those holes I grouped my red 2-0 pops and the raspberry tootsie roll pop I grouped those closer together so that it would look like a massive cherry on top the other thing I'm going to do is take one of my silly straws and I'm going to use the yellow one since I used the yellow tissue paper in the center to cover the foam ball I'm going to put the silly straw into the suckers and it will color coordinate with that yellow tissue paper I have now put the straw into my sundae you could actually do it at more of an angle if you wanted to I'm not going to I think that looks cute and I'm going to put some ribbon around the bottom you don't have to I've just got some birthday ribbon and some celebration ribbon some with some coordinating balloons that match the tissue paper and that blue dish this is the final item here I made with dum dum lollipops and some tootsie roll pops a silly straw that has a little squiggle and then I put some finishing touches of some happy birthday ribbon and some ribbon that's got the matching blue and yellow balloons and if you get those jumbo bags of the dum-dums and you only want to use dum-dums then you could actually just do the entire thing with them domes you don't have to worry about trying to make a cherry on top I think this turned out really cute and I also put the link to the lady's video that I got this from I think it was right out cutlery I don't know if I'm saying that right but anyway she did a really cute or actually two too cute ones using those blow pops that way you can see what it looks like but anyway this is my version of it with sometimes n20 pops she'll also be able to keep Sunday class and have some ice cream later so I think that's a really great idea and so cute to do for one person it's also you know if you're going to have like a candy buffet table this is still a cute idea to do instead of the dumb dumb topiary trees if you just want to go with like an ice cream social type of theme you can also if you have a themed like baby showers and things in certain colors you can go to Oriental Trading calm and get suckers that are in specific colors and then do an entire candy bouquet a lollipop okay in that one specific color if you want to I like to have it all mixed up I think that looks really cute and it's something happy you can do this for someone who's in the hospital this is a great Getwell gift and birthdays it's just do anything that you want to do with it for tonight's sunday bouquet of suckers I'm going to try something different I thought it would be cute to use marshmallows to be the whipped cream on top of the sundae and then put a lone cherry Tootsie Roll pop in the very middle for the cherry so we'll have the the sundae the whipped cream and the cherry on top in order to do the marshmallow suckers I already had some in stock but they're these 6-inch sticks that I got at Joanne's and I just popped a six inch stick into the base of one of my marshmallows and then I add some little love some little Silla Fame bags these are the kind that you do the pretzels in or so I just use that and cut the bag off to the size that I need it and then just put the twisty tie on it so this is going to be a little bit taller and that's what you want because you want the whip cream to be on the top bye guys thanks so much for watching and have a sparkle rific day you", "julaE5DkP0g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as

it but I can't put this juice down there's something about it now on the inhale I'm getting the nice strawberry flavor I don't get that I think that's where I'm getting the sweet taste from and then on the exhale I'm getting this lovely grape I'm getting this really lovely great it's a super vape there's there's no harshness in there there's no hidden nasties or anything like that and it doesn't taste chemically in any way it's just a delicious juice it really is the only thing wrong with it is it will gunk up your coils but certain juices you can excuse that you you know you can rework and

talk more about it so strawberry girls comes in zero three and six milligram nicotine comes in these cool 100 milliliter bottles and as you probably guessed is a 70 30 vgpg ratio now guys i've got it in the argus gt fat rabbit tank brand new coil giver of light oh oh just so so light and nice it's really light it's been awhile since i've had a juice like this light in this area so there's other juices when you like inhale them and then exhale them leaves like this like this feeling in your mouth that the juice just feels heavy i'm sure you know exactly what i'm talking about but with this one it it really doesn't it's a nice light airy almost crisp taste coming out of it so on the inhale i'm getting i get a little bit of strawberry but on the exhale but on the eggshell i get a lot of strawberry and a little bit of the candy flavoring in here i really like this juice i picked it up for the first time today and when i tell you let me tell you how you feeling right now that i was genuinely shocked about how this was gonna taste because i thought it was gonna taste a lot like the strawberry belts they had just without the sour and while it does it has a unique flavor i don't i don't think they're using the same strawberry compound they probably are but it just doesn't taste like it because though i ain't got the rona it's just it's just vape cough it's just it's just vape

medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm

isn't looking too well i'm hoping it'll make it you're just growing that wasn't there like a week ago but i'm just hoping it'll come back if it doesn't that's fine here is like a fruit that set like i think like a week ago and this one also set like a week ago and this flower is just opening this one set like two weeks ago and you can see the strawberry is already developing this one doesn't have any flowers this one i think the flower got trapped in there so i don't know and i think it'll just grow by itself yeah there's a whole entire bunch of flowers coming up but they haven't bloomed yet i've noticed that even on the flower branches i mean they're like the flower bunches they're still like little tiny mini leaves like that you can see not this one this one it's also connected to the flower stem and there's like four flowers on this one i think there's on this brunch there's like um four also this one has i can only see three but there might be four blocks and here's another fruit that set um two weeks ago and it's looking like my best one you can see the seeds are really starting to show and i'm hoping that this one will grow and ripen up soon here on this bunch there are three flowers which one already set and no runners yet but i'm hoping for runners you can see the stems are actually really pink you can see this one this one is older so i think it's kind of daft and it doesn't really have that much fuzz not as much as the newer ones you can see sometimes they push out flowers and new growth at the same time like this one and now this one's going a little bit bigger but yeah i'm really looking forward for these babies to ripen and i kind of can't wait to taste them so um yeah that's just a really quick update on my um strawberry plants bye", "EmpyHkwXBj0": "making a chocolate moustache lollipop is a lot easier than growing a moustache you start with melted chocolate use either candy melts or tempered chocolate and to learn how to temper chocolate view our video tempering chocolate easier than you think use a ladle a squeeze bottle or even a spoon to fill the cavities of your mold don't overfill them because then you will have to scrape away the excess chocolate from the sides of the cast place the lollipop sticks into the stick channels and give them a 180-degree turn to ensure that the chocolate adheres well to them tap the mold on a flat surface to smooth out the chocolate and force any air bubbles to rise out of the melted chocolate place your mold in the freezer for about 10 minutes until the chocolate sets and hardens when it is set the chocolate will shrink away from the mold the back of the mold will look gray ish rather than brown when the chocolate has shrunk away turn your mold over carefully and your chocolate lollipops will drop out", "41Vx9F4Ayws": "opening of smackers i am cutting this", "f0O0vDw4Nfs": "so in today's video I figured we would make something fun something that I made when I was a little girl which is rock candy rock candy can be kind of expensive to buy at the store but is so cheap to make at home and you can make it for your kids for your grandkids for your nieces and nephew it is perfect for any elegant party that you want to put on so let's get started on making rock [Music] now I'm gonna take a pan and turn it on high heat now I'm going to take three cups of sugar and put it in the pan along with one cup of water and you'll want to cook this until it dissolves and it starts boiling and you'll want to stir it every so often so nothing burns all right so it's started boiling as you can see so as soon as it starts boiling you'll want to take it off the heat right away and let it cool down for about ten minutes and while it's cleaned down we can get the other supplies ready now you want to get some skewers or some other sticks a lot of times people just buy sucker sticks but you obviously don't have to I wouldn't waste the money but you want to get however many you're gonna be making I'm gonna be making six total so I'm getting three and then you'll just want to take them and break them in half so you get obviously a total of six now you want to cook the sticks with some sugar water so you want to just take the mixture that you just made up and just kind of run it through that and take a cup of sugar and just put them in there put it in there and this is what will help your crystals to grow because the crystals need something to attach themselves to to start growing so you want to just kind of run it through that and you need to wait for them to dry so I'm just gonna continue to do that but in the sugar this is just pure sugar and the more sugar you get on the stick the more I find that the crystals grow bigger so if you can see there's kind of a thin coat of the sugar on there at this point I will double dip and I will run them right back through so for some reason this works I just take the sugar water rum run it back through and as you can see it's actually more of a simple syrup you can see it didn't really come off which is perfect because I need it thicker so as you can see it is thicker now so you can see there are a lot thicker now and you want to just let this dry for about five minutes or until the simple syrup has cooled down for a total of ten minutes or longer if you want now it's time for me to add my flavoring and coloring to make the rock candy really pretty um so some people use just food coloring and they might use a type of extract I like to make it really simple so I like to just add some syrup anything that has coloring and syrup I use this I use this which obviously this is more for adults because it has a little liquor in it but really anything that is a type of sugar syrup because really this this syrup is like a simple syrup and so I'm gonna just add a tablespoon into each Cup and you can use whatever kind of cup you want you can if you use a really long cup then your crystals can form really long nice suckers but I'm just gonna use one of these old Welch's jars I love these things and then just take my syrup and add a tablespoon into each Cup so you can pick whatever flavor whatever coloring you want um if you want them to be even stronger colors you can add a course with coloring as well but I just like to make it simple and just like to add a tablespoon therefore I get the color and I get their really great flavor [Music] okay so now once your simple syrup has cooled down for about 10 minutes you can go ahead and add them to the cups and the reason why you want it to cool down because you don't want it to be too hot where it melts all the sugar right off of the sticks because if you do then you won't really grow any crystals on it because it will melt the sugar right off and you need the sugar on the sticks in order for your crystals to grow so for the flavorings I did black berry and strawberry and then obviously the alcohol one and you'll just want to take your sticks and some clothes pins and just basically put it on here and since this sugar water mixture has cooled down you can go ahead and just put them in there and you'll kind of want to line it up perfectly so it's not quite at the bottom because you want room for the crystals to grow and just kind of make it so it's not too far down and not too far to the side so they can grow and not get a touch to the side of the cup to take your clothes pins put them on there them in the jar now is the hard part because it is the waiting process so basically you just have to wait until the crystals grow and you can pick when you want to take them out so they can be as soon as three days they can be as long as two weeks however long you want to wait [Music] [Music] [Music] so now that it has been seven days I'm going to take them out since they do look like they have grown enough but if you can kind of see on the top let me focus this there is actually a hard layer which it kind of forms and so you'll need to break this layer you can see it's actually just basically candy so technically you could eat this because everything in here you pretty much can eat but what you'll want to do is you'll want to break the top layer so you want to just take like a butter knife or whatever you want and then just break it break it up both sides be able to get the candy out and then you just want to make sure they kind of detach that's why you want to put this there for the side now this one didn't turn out that amazing it's probably the smallest one but anyways you still can eat it and you want to just take it out and put it on a plate to dry out and just kind of drain the liquid off of it and then put this on the plate too to dry a little bit and you just continue to break the rest of them and then of course these are the adult ones nice and big and I really am quite surprised how easily this one comes out and there's only a thin layer on top just kind of shake it off and put it on the plate also so you can kind of see they're sparkly alright guys so I hope you enjoyed watching this video and I figured who better to test these candies out than my kids so this is Aiden hi and this was Tristan he just turned 11 but we're pretty much the same Heights pretty sad but anyways so I figured we would try this candy out you guys want to try it out yeah all right they've been waiting patiently it has been a long wait for them you guys think peg could even eat them superfast yeah alright guys thank you guys so much and if you have any questions just comment below and

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

And it doesn't really matter what color you use because we're going to cover in chocolate anyway So just like that Here are a few that I've already done and I've also done some strawberries as well so here I have some white chocolate that I used and I'm going to add some pink chocolate and I'm going to put this in the microwave and melt it so I only put it in the microwave for about 10 seconds because the white chocolate was already melted so now I'm going to dip my cake pops in to the chocolate Just like that and tap off the excess So now that I have coated all of these in chocolate I'm going to decorate them like this so that they are really pretty Here are two of them that I have finished and now I'm going to drizzle some of this milk chocolate onto these so here on put a piece of

super in your face strawberry but still has an essence of strawberry this is okay just to me though I think should just spend a little more forefront on strawberry if they're calling it a strawberry if it's not it mixed with something else to me this one was just okay it's not awful it's not bad whatsoever it's it is what it is it's a great juice for the price it is but for me I would have loved

guys very much brown", "p3lazS7YvpM": "- Hello everybody, welcome back. Today I'm gonna show you how to make the cutest chocolate lollipops. So if you haven't made\nchocolate lollipops before, I'm gonna walk you through all the steps on how to make it, and yours\nwill turn our perfectly. So let's get started. So first you have a choice\nbetween two different kinds of chocolate when you're\nmaking a lollipop. So you can either use regular chocolate, like finding a chocolate\nbar at the grocery store and melting it down using that, or you can use Candy Melts. The difference between the two is that Candy Melts is set at room temperature, they're also called Mercken's, and they stay hard at room temperature. You don't have to do any extra effort. Other chocolate, or more pure chocolate, because candy melts are\nkind of compound chocolate, not really actually\nchocolate kind of thing. Some people love the taste of them, I personally don't but\nthey're very pretty candy. (laughs) and they're really good\nif you are new to this. But if you prefer the flavor of real, traditional chocolate, there\nare some other steps for you. So you can either temper your chocolate, which I've tried so many\ntimes and I have failed, and where you bring the chocolate up to a certain temperature\nand then cool it slightly, and then bring it up the\ntemperature again, I think. And either way, it gives\nthe chocolate that beautiful glossiness to it and it makes\nit snap when you break it. When you melt chocolate\nit gets untempered, so you have to re-temper it\nevery time that you melt it. So yeah, that takes a lot of effort. You can buy tempering machines if you really want to invest in it. But usually what I do at home if I want to actually use\nchocolate instead of Candy Melts is I just pop it in the fridge and I store the lollipops in the fridge, and they will stay nice and firm while they're in the fridge. But they will soften a little\nbit at room temperature. So the Candy Melt option allows you to kinda handle it a little bit more, and they won't melt in transportation. And you can keep it room temperature. If you're using real chocolate, like just a chocolate bar that you get at the grocery store and melt down. You're gonna want to\nkeep it in the fridge, and keep it in the fridge\nuntil you give it to the person and have them put it back in the fridge. So it's totally up to you, but those are the two differences. All right so today I\ndecided to use Candy Melts because we have the cutest color. We are using pink Candy Melts today. And if you want to pick some up, I'll link them down below. Wilton makes a ton of them, this video isn't sponsored by them, but everything I used\nwas actually from Wilton. So all the products that you use will be linked below if\nyou want to pick them up. So I'm using pink and brown Candy Melts to get my desired effect. But again, you can use\nwhatever you'd like. So first things first, you\nwant to pop the Candy Melts, or your chocolate, whatever you'd like, this is the same for either material, into a microwave safe bowl. And microwave it at 30 second intervals, stirring each interval and just keep going until it is fully melted. The reason why we melt\nthem at 30 second intervals is so that you don't burn the\nchocolate or the Candy Melts. If you heat them too much, they can burn, and they can get all lumpy. I remember someone commented\nsaying that happened. And that's what happens,\nchocolate can burn, it's really frustrating. So you just want to gradually\nheat it and melt it. Another tool that I have\nthat has saved my life, it changed everything for me, get a little melting pot from Wilton. What it is, is basically\na little silicone pot that you put in another little thing. And when you turn that\non, it gently heats, you know the Candy Melts or the chocolate. And so it allows them to\nmelt without burning it. So this is more of a fail safe option, if you want to use it. If you're melting chocolate\na lot of the time, get this, it's so much\neasier, oh my goodness. So once your chocolate or\nCandy Melts have melted, pour them into any kid\nof mold that you'd like. So for lollipop sticks, you want to get the molds\nthat have the little spot to put the lollipop stick. I'll link a couple down\nbelow for Valentine's Day, since Valentine's Day is\ncoming up pretty soon. And then after they're in, grab a little lollipop stick, again these are also from Wilton, and just kind of swirl it\nin the chocolate a little so that you coat all sides of\nthe tip of the lollipop stick and then just set it into the little space it's supposed to be. Coating it on all sides just makes it a little bit more secure and so that when it's completely hardened, the lollipop stick will\nstay inside your lollipop. And now what you want to do is carefully transfer that to the fridge. Candy Melts do set at room temperature, but they set even faster in the fridge. And they set a little bit firmer. If you're using pure chocolate, I usually put it in the freezer because it sets much\nquicker in the freezer. You can put it in the fridge, but you'll be waiting\nmaybe like an hour or so. Whereas the Candy Melts it's like 15 minutes and then you're done. So then just un-mold them and you can get some more Candy Melts to\ndo a little drizzle effect. I like that effect because it makes them look like chocolate truffles. I melted some brown Candy Melts. And I popped them into a piping bag and I just snipped the end\nof the pipping bag off. So that will create a really beautiful and consistent drizzle. Sometimes you can drizzle it with like a fork or a knife. You can just dip it in your chocolate. But if you want it to look like more natural, and professional, and cleaner, and you want the drizzle to have kind of a consistent weight to it, put it in a pipping bag, or a Ziploc bag, and just snip a little hole at the end. It'll make your life so much easier. And then pop them back into the fridge for that layer to set, and we are done. So thank you so much for watching. I hope that you like this video.

today's video I'm going to show you guys how I wanna make my lollipops and they're a good size but they're the size of my palm so they're pretty big you can make these as big or as little as you want to so these are just a few that I made so what you're gonna need in this video a skewer lollipop stick or a cake pop stick whichever one you prefer now I use the skewers because they are a little bit longer but they do get heavy like the longer it is they do get heavy so it tends to bend a little bit I haven't had any snap on me but so first I'm gonna show you guys how I make my twist lollipops alright guys so you will need some polymer clay any color that you want to use you can I'm gonna be using a pearl teal color purple color and also a dusty rose color and a white need this for a little while just until it becomes soft so this is what we call making a cane so first you're gonna make a cane they're not really difficult I know they look kind of difficult and you're like how the heck did you make that well it's pretty easy alright so you want to make it about the same but you want to make these smaller and take some of our white make about three smaller ones to go in between each of these alright so with our white piece of clay we're gonna take our colors and we're just gonna start placing those on [Music] what you want to do is you want to mash these together mash those mash it on down [Music] [Music] just because those two are getting kind of close together and it might cover up that white I'm gonna put a piece of white right here just to make sure it doesn't cover up the white but I'm gonna put a little piece right here that way these won't cover up the white either [Music] [Music] kind of thin it's not too thin but it's getting kind of thin so you're just gonna turn it you're just gonna turn it you're just gonna start spinning it make sure you're very light which and he asked cuz you don't want to mess it up so you're just gonna turn it turn it alright guys so once you have that you're gonna sit it out the way and what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna make another one and this one's going to be teal and white [Music] [Applause] alright guys for my lollipop twist I like to use a skewer so I just take the skewer and I just wrap the cane around the skewer just wrap around it's really easy self-explanatory you guys can see it so you pretty much get it [Music] and what you're gonna do now is place both of them on a baking sheets I put a little foil down and then I put it in my toaster oven and I bake my super slow but I want you guys to read the directions on the back of your package so that you can do it correctly next up we have our lollipops so I'm going to show you guys how to make this really quickly [Music] [Music] dead of rolling this around a stick we're just gonna roll this on itself as he you come up with a big spiral circle that looks like a pinwheel then you're just gonna stick a lollipop stick in there I get in the oven Inger done now I did add some extra glitter for this because I wanted it to be sparkly so that's optional you can do that if you want to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after its baked and it's been cool for a while I'm just gonna take some of my triple thick gloss that I got from Hobby Lobby and I'm gonna glaze this up real nice now this is optional it looks beautiful the way it is but you can opt to make it a little more shine here so do this if you want to if you want to keep it matte looking it's beautiful both ways thank you so much for watching don't forget to follow me on Instagram my name

with it but yeah me personally um i honestly do not even like takis um that's one that's one of the kids things um not really my cup of tea but when my daughter saw it in the store she felt like that'd be a good thing to put on there i don't think they have these at walmart i have not seen them at walmart and i actually look for them at walmart end up finding them at the dollar tree yeah no i'm live um and actually it was just a dollar for three lollipops um about two packs yeah so we ended up buying two packs so i'm not saying we could eat i know i'm not gonna eat all three of them more

video yes so we could have opened it up let you open yours up okay so okay so at first when i felt it in the car it felt weird because like i felt this powder stuff but i didn't feel the lollipop until i took like a different spot right and i thought the lollipop turned by itself and then the powder okay so the way it's filling is the lollipop in here and it's a powder here now i'm assuming the way to eat it is to probably you know taste the lollipop for a little while and then dip it in the powder and then kind of have your whole sensation from it i would like to repeat it again i do not like tacos i just want to throw that out there taki's are good though he just don't like the way it tastes or whatever i don't know why kids like them like kids all over the world love tacos and i really feel like i don't know if y'all need to get looked at yeah so let me go try this out oh wow yeah i don't like the way she just said that okay so it already has the chili powder so he can't can't even taste the sucker oh wow okay so this stuff is drenched on the other side and it's crazy because like i don't know if you're supposed to keep on smell spicy so this is the thing yeah why is sucker spicy like some of these suckers spicy they're good why i can smell it from here i can smell it from here i'm trying to okay all right so what we gonna do is we gotta give it a shot um y'all

a galaxy I probably tell them they're a fool but that's exactly what this product is trying to be out of this world or should you just buy a kicker contrary to what you might expect given how ambitious the idea is these lollipops are actually homemade and so they're actually presented in a rather authentic cardboard box inside of which you get the individually packaged sweets something worth noting is that getting ten of these is actually going to net you $30 making this some of the most expensive confectionary I've ever laid eyes on each one is individually packaged but it seems almost a little bit pointless all the packaging does is just reiterates the ingredients which I've already told you on the back and then it reminds you the universe which is always helpful if it's something you can't deny it so these are some of the best looking lollipops you've ever seen while the back is plain from the front you can see the galaxies and they glisten they actually shimmer in the light and they look really really eye-catching what makes this package more exciting is that each of the ten lollipops actually represents its own galaxy and with that they come with their own unique flavors we've got everything from coconut to cinnamon to peppermint however the flavors are quite simple they don't evolve as you progress through the suite and there's nothing else to really spice up the experience on top of that considering the flavors are a little bit atypical you're probably not going to find one person who would enjoy all of them for example I thought the great forms really unique and really interesting and tasty but the cinnamon I probably have rather eaten my own toenail in conclusion though Oh does she say this works as a rather nice gift it's presented well it's something a little bit different and I'd say it's more exciting than just buying a standard set of however for example thanks a lot for watching guys see you next time you", "aW4iRWw0T7U": "hello I'm Jerry Ford god I have a candy sucker you know type thing here that I used to I used to eat these things all the time back in the back in the 90s when I worked for a restoration company and I worked with a lot of Hispanic guys and this this is what they introduced me to these are the bureau mango suckers from the grupo Bimbo company yeah they got me they got me anything and and I I used to after they got me hooked on these things I used to like go by on myself at the Merc and eat those little Mexican market that's for you that's where you find him and you get good prices there you know then when I worked at the same time I worked for the restoration company we would we went on a on a job that that we ended up going over to Texas and and when we was in Texas we were close to the Mexican border so we went across the board and went to a little a little store over there and yeah screaming big bag big bag to these things for for really really cheap prices and how about private three or four bags of them took him back to sorry took him back home and I had a little office and I would had a little store going myself in there and I would sell you know energy drink soda pops suckers and all kinds other candies and stuff and it was kind of a convenient thing for all the guys to they you know they would come over to my office and I would sell him an energy drink a cold coffee like the frappuccinos and stuff like that and I would take the money and I would go buy more stuff and I'd make a little bit of a profit it wasn't nothing big but it was a fun little thing plus the guys had something had resources they could just come to me and get something you know and I had you know had a little refrigerator in my office and I kept a stop with soda pops of stuff but oh yeah these little suckers these little bureau mangrove suckers are like I said I carried this thing with me all the time on jobs and stuff at first you know when they first introduced me to these suckers and I was I was a little surprised because I wasn't expecting you know what these things are these are these are candy covered are there candies there are chili powder coverage suckers is what they are Schuyler it says chili covered mango acylated a kick a kick a keep a sick you dude I can't read that good lollipop artificially flavored ingredients sugar corn syrup citric acid and qualia chili pepper I douse iodized salt contains milk and peanuts or making to contain imported and distributed by bar sell USA made in Mexico alright get in this time it's been a long time I found these at a little grocery store not too far from where I live I was surprised I saw him two dollars for a bag tin this is what they look like kind of a kind of a dark brown color that's kind of shy see the shininess got that it's probably the what they just you know you know the candies probably wet of course when they put that chili powder on there but usually makes me cough you got to get through the chili powder first get to the candy but look good me and to you gotta like chili bother the ball so it's not gravity and like a 12 pack or something like that with these things actually might not been that mean but so I've been you know trying to link them with what we're using stuff as I've juiced up 8.5% ABV let's clear this vido mango with that with this wheel Wow that's pretty good that's pretty good they got other stuff to that store getting better hmm you can get these in other other forms other kinds they make them and make this one that you like give you a little packet or chili powder and then the sucker and you can dip it in it and then lick it up the they like a thick coat of the chili powder it's coming off somewhat it's getting down to the candy you get a little bit of sweetness with it now put it you know see dip the strong chili powder is gone it doesn't heat up just a little bit left the lighter stuff that's but yeah these are good if you see these and you like chili powder and like these kind of things pick them up if you've never tried it before well good [Applause] [Applause] very good all right well I'm gonna get there um thanks for watching I appreciate

sweetness to it underneath this tastes like a pilot ah shot if you guys have ever had a pauletta shop this is what it tastes like this is probably where they got it from mmm good stuff the spicy sourness on the outside really complements that mango mmm it's just it's pretty sour for me so that's why I bite it cuz I like a little bit of the sweetness with the sour the other way you're gonna

last one so that's my first one that's my second that's my and that is my last so my last one is like oh it's really bad oh yeah I'm thus the cherry wanted to really turn up so badly but yeah right", "L4cK8oU3yho": "no I'm gonna start the videos from now on I'll just be chic and Rebelde she's a badass oh hello welcome to big deals with Kate me and her cat yes yes hey I'm cat so if you watched our previous video you'll know that we already did the Falcon tank which we're using today with our drags which we probably should have pointed out in the other video because we always use our drugs yeah but how am I gonna yeah mines raggedy - but I disguised it yeah and I don't so in today's video we're gonna be testing two of the same flavors but from different brands we have one up strawberry gummy and then we have the standard vape it's red gummy which is technically strawberry coming yet not one is a six milligram because she's a psycho and mine's a three milligram sorry yeah so we're gonna be testing them trying to see the differences because a lot of a lot of brands do this there's like 100 million blue Rises there's a hundred million strawberry hates the thing none of them do you've never supposed to be today yeah so we're gonna we're just gonna try out these to see the differences we'll probably do a lot more of these I'm thinking because we do get requests of people just like coming to the website and being being like hey there's this blue raspberry flavor tastes more like a sweet blue raspberry like more of a desert blue raspberry or like hmm it tastes like candy went to whenever I smile hers earlier I thought it was gonna be like strawberry milk smell like nice sweet smell the way it tastes so so hairy still tastes like lemonade because lemonade likes to stick in the coil mine on the other hand I just changed the coil you know and I can already tell you how that one tastes because tasted it before and we both have I know I just don't remember what it tastes like it's like it's not as sweet as this it's like semi sweet but it tastes like strawberry gummy like for sure for sure like I would always go me there yeah I would always tell people that it was either like a cherry or strawberry gummy depending on like who the person was or I would just say it's like a cherry strawberry gummy like and then they would try and it legit tasted like you just took a bite of a strawberry gummy cuz it even had that like powdery like back like hint to it and this one tastes it has it kind of has a creamy taste to it at the same time this one does like a that's what I was smelling I smelt like creamy like I got no click that shock there's strawberry cream the candies you nobody can find anywhere yeah I know what you're talking it kind of tastes like that and that they usually on those eggs need as coffee cough drops to boner the smoothies your holiday windows are good though the world I hate does like candy but then the SMS semuc I'm sent my stomach yeah that wasn't worried but yeah this kind of tastes like that nope it has more candy to it then it does cream which is nice I love how when we're not trying to do vape trick videos are just a fulfill dragon thing why was it doing that I feel like when I do it my way pretty big so I have to like spread my mouth out and I just plenty let me watch can't really breathe out of this nostril right now so it's not really helping I look funny but yeah this is a 1-up strawberry yummy I don't know if I said that did you say that yeah okay that one's yeah buy one up we'll have that right that's not available right now then this isn't I didn't he did oh nice yeah I still don't have my flavor in it does it taste like that I can't really tiny check I feel like I'm getting more of the flavor in it now yeah it's coming through but that lemonade's still there but it's it's good it's still really good that was one of the best one yeah hold out of that line and was that one in the blue one and then the blue one was blue raspberry gummy mm-hmm the white woman's pineapple gummy that one I still love that one it's really good no one's she surprisingly like me and pineapple don't get along whenever it's artificial cuz it always hurts like the citrusy flavors always hurt me for some reason it makes me cough really bad but that one didn't let me die okay I'll revive you this one does taste just like those mercy those candies they're like milky ones me no strawberry cream yeah that's weird because it's supposed to be a gummy I know I was like a milky creamy flavor exactly and it's super good it's really good yeah that one's really good because it has that hint of cream and I'm not big on like 30 flavors so whenever it has like a hint of something I can do it except I'm kind of scared cuz this one's a little more sweeter then that one so I'm afraid that I might get tired of it because of how sweet it is it's not extremely sweet but it's Morgan already mix it with like a fruity yeah thinking like that strawberry water vine mm-hmm monster if you don't want super creamy and you do want strawberry like a really good show brain like a light cream yeah that one is definitely it sounds better than I expected it to be honestly because the smell is throwing me what UPS apparently is super popular like high-end brand I mean their packaging is nice most people like you don't you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover but everybody does you know that consciously and the packaging is also really nice it has this little flat shirt under this camera so the packaging itself would get you just just simply because it's black and then it has like the accent color it's like very modern and simple and all of the same and then you just open it and it's like a little booklet and then it tells you like the little description even has a picture of the gummy bear definitely tastes like a real strawberry though it does it's a nice pick some strawberries and like I believe it yeah that one tastes like I'm real like sugary shoot me yeah like if you dip your strawberries and sugar which is never defeats the purpose but I do that all the time that's kind of where you just get like a perfectly ripened strawberry no rain whipped cream yeah this one just tastes like a straight-up red gummy bear no no it's not raised with whipped cream or you know those those fruit trays where it has that like fruit yogurt I don't even know exactly what it is I know what you're talking about so good yep that's that's what that tastes like oh my god yep I recommend this flavor I recommend that flavor these are both two really good flavors it's funny though because they taste completely different exactly and they're supposed to be the exact same mm-hmm that's why videos like this are good always do your research like if you're really hesitant about a flavor make sure you know multiple site yeah go to multiple sites not only do it have now usually they have reviews on the products on websites or you can just go to youtube and look it up usually people do have a lot of reviews on certain flavors I mean maybe you next time we'll just get like a like a few like instead of two we can get like three or four yeah but we'd have to get our teas but all right I think that's gonna be it for this video as always they go for watching if you want more like this just let us know like flavor profiles that you want us to review I'm sure we have said anything plenty yeah more than we should I keep getting more in yep so yeah just let us know and we'll do more of these soon but for today

enough of them it's going to be a good [ __ ] night but before we begin I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone I'm ready who shared my video I've got the word out there that means a hell of a lot to me so thank you very much anyway vodka lollipops first of all you're gonna need some vodka about quarter of a pint and a tablespoon of powdered food coats followed by 450 grams of sugar add the vodka to a measuring jug with a little bit of water and then put a pan on a low heat and add the sugar a glucose and lastly the vodka next year stir it until it dissolves and then crank it up to a high heat and put the lid on then just put grease proof paper onto a baking tray and get you all these sticks out after about three minutes just get the mixture and pour it onto the lolly sticks the shape might come out a bit weird if you're not very good at it as you can see like I am but it doesn't matter because you can still eat them anyone after you've done that just let them call until they pardon oh these are delicious I know that the shape came out a bit weird but nonetheless it's a sugary lollipop with [ __ ] vodka in it what gets better than that make sure that you subscribe make sure you tell your friends since that's the only way we can get this [ __ ] show out there and I really appreciate you guys talking about talking about how you're going to do your recipe so leave a comment below I'm off to get drunk on sweet", "r2yYGuMWhns": "hey everyone welcome back to the awesomer pop channel ah love is in the air valentine's day is coming up in a couple of weeks and i'm sure many of you are starting to think about what you want to get your loved ones maybe you should already have the gift but this is for all my procrastinators also don't worry we're not trying to single out all the single people this is something anyone can make for anybody i love all of my fans so these roses are for you today but before we jump into it if you're new to the channel be sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on that notification bell so you don't miss any awesome videos alright let's begin in order to make jolly rancher roses we are going to need a lot of jolly ranchers i'm going to be using red green blue and purple but feel free to use whatever colors you like i'll be using these wooden skewers for the stems and those are all the ingredients we'll need pretty simple right now i'm going to pour boiling water into this bowl it may not look like it but this water is hot hopefully your love for someone is just as hot oh that was good okay i'm being lame now we don't need to peel the wrappers off just dump the jolly ranchers into the bowl we'll start with red and you want to keep them in the water for about a minute or two at that point you'll notice that our hard candy turns into soft candy you can poke it with a skewer to check it out if the candies are mushy you can take them out of the water make sure you use a spoon because the water's hot and for this next part you definitely want to wear gloves so the candies don't stain your hands now we're just gonna peel all the wrappers off and then we can shape the candies into a rose now if you're wondering why we didn't just peel the wrappers off in the beginning well the wrappers actually help prevent the candies from clumping together and turning into one giant jolly rancher you'll see later but we'll need each individual piece to make our delicate jolly rancher rose and i know it can get pretty annoying peeling the wrappers off after they've been in boiling hot water but don't get lazy you're making this with love and it'll all be worth it at the end okay enough mushy talk let's check out our mushy candy to make the rose grab your wooden skewer place your flat jolly rancher towards the tip and wrap it around as much as you can you should be able to wrap it all the way around like this now we're going to grab another piece of jolly rancher stretch it out make it look like a laffy taffy and then you just want to wrap this around your first jolly rancher and as you can see we're just making layers of rose petals you want to pinch the bottoms and shape the top part to look like petals this can get a bit tricky because the candy is still pretty hard to shape but the good thing is this won't break so take your time with it and make the rose look as pretty as possible let's make one more rose petal and i think we'll have a nice looking jolly rancher whoa rose done shaping it here's our beautiful red jolly rancher rose but we still need to add more to this now let's use the green jolly ranchers to make the green leaves just like before we'll stretch this out a bit and then shape this into a leaf best way to describe this and maybe not the prettiest but try to make a giant toenail now let's put the leaf right under the rose now this looks much better all right here's a look at our jolly rancher rose what do you think this looks really pretty right let's put our jolly rancher rose in the cup we'll keep that in here while we make another flower this time we'll use a bunch of different colors let's use red again pretty much we're going to do the same thing i'll wrap this around a bit tighter this time now let's wrap a green jolly rancher petal around the red petal oh i'm slowly getting the hang of this shaping it is getting much easier now oh yeah this looks really pretty it looks like the green petal is hugging the red petal now let's wrap the blue petal around the green petal for this flower i'm making the top part more flat that way we get these rounder looking petals i think it looks really pretty now let's do the same with this purple petal going to do a double layer there we go here's our rainbow jolly rancher rose this one looks beautiful i know i made this but i'm pretty impressed here's a closer look to all my awesomer fans this one's for you okay let's make one more this time i'm going to start with the purple petal wrap this around tightly guys i think i'm a pro now if anyone's looking to hire a jolly rancher rosemaker i'm your guy all right now let's wrap a blue petal around now let's wrap a green petal and let's finish this with a couple of red petals doing this the opposite way and it looks really cool so far not sure which one i like the best yet also i made these rose petals a little different than the other ones here's a closer look which one was your favorite and i know these look amazing but remember you can also eat these too alright and here's a little jolly rancher rose bouquet if you had to give this to someone who would you give it to let us know in the comments like i said before these are from my awesomer fans love y'all awesomer pop fans thank you so much for watching we can't do this without you if you're new to the channel and became a fan click that subscribe button for more awesome stuff and if you want to be the first person to watch our next video hit that notification bell to have a chance see ya [Music] you", "4sfOiLjglac": "hi guys welcome back to my channel in today's video I am going to share with you how to make these really cool giant life of decorations they're really effective and if you look online you can actually find them and they are quite expensive so it's definitely worth making them at home if you fancy being a little bit creative if you watching this video and you're new to my channel I would love to you subscribe I post loads of different DIY videos on my channel so if you like that kind of thing then I would love for you to hit that button it down below so for this DIY you are going to need some pool noodles so I have got two two blue ones and I have got two yellow ones because I am making these two different and lollipops the reason you're going to need two noodles of each color is because you want to join them together like this because if you just use one noodle you're naughty pop will not be a giant so as well as using two noodles you're also going to need some duct tape I have got this pink one because together with the yellow and the blue it just looks really really effective we're also going to me that some piping this is actually just poking from whips you can get from any hardware store and it's actually just like a plumbing pipe it's like a solid one that's hollow so it's really really good for this DIY you're also going to need a glue gun and finishing touches you are going to need some of these compact sticks because this is what I kind of use as well to secure everything together and then since cellophane in a bone to finish everything off so what I would suggest you do first of all is get your cool noodles and just bend them slightly this is going to make them a little bit more flexible because when you buy your pool noodles to begin with they are quite rigid and tough so obviously you as you will be bending them you want them to be quite flexible and I just got these from Amazon so you can kind of get this pool noodles anywhere they're $1.99 a noodle and you like I said and buy these big lollipops for quite a lot more than that so it's definitely worth making your own if you are interesting right so the first thing that you want to do is to get some of your glue garnet blue and then stick your two pool noodles together once but quite generous onto two ends of your pool noodles so they stick together and just hold them like that for a couple of minutes to make sure everything is dry and they will stay in place what I also like to do is go over the join in the middle of first off so I will wrap my tape around there and then I will get your duct tape and then just work your way down the pool noodles wrapping it around this way it gives a really nice lollipop look and it gives a really kind of vibrant look as well what I try to do is make sure I go in with a join in the middle as well just to kind of like straightening up so once you have done that then you're ready to roll when it comes to the rolling process it is quite hard work so you need to either get someone in to help you I got my husband Chris as he was the official roller and I would put on all of the glue stick down at the very first part of the roll this is I would say the hardest bit to get stuck so just make sure if you have this bit right then the rest of your noodle will roll up really really well as you work your way down and you don't just keep on applying your hot glue gun glue and just do it really slowly to make sure everything sets while you are rolling once you have finished rolling up your noodle you can then secure everything with your kebab sticks I just put four kebab sticks and I push them through the middle to get all the little sections to join together once you have done that you are then ready to cut a hole at the base of your joint roll up and you can then pop your little filament tubing into the hole I like to secure mine with a little bit more glue and just to make sure it doesn't go anywhere once you have done that you are then ready to wrap everything in same thing pop a bow around it and you are ready to decorate your party [Music] so much for watching today's video I hope you enjoyed it let me know if you try these out at home and I will see you next time bye guys [Music]", "dTzGqms0zyU": "[Music] tasty tasty ah this is that time I want to

think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better

these so that way you could see the vanilla flecks in the lollipop itself we're then going to top it with some rainbow sprinkles I am trying to hit 2,000 subscribers on my birthday in June so if you haven't hit subscribe hit that button now here's how we're going to make those lollipops the first thing we're going to do is make our candy base and I have 133 grams of light corn syrup in my saucepan I went ahead and measured it in here because I didn't want to waste any of that stuff because it's so sticky we're then gonna add 200 grams of granulated sugar and 75 grams of water we're going to take this over to the stove and cook this until it reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit off to the stove we go while that's heating up on the stove we're going to prepare our candy making station I have a towel here that we're going to set our pot on as soon as it comes off the stove once it comes off the heat and it's here we're going to add a quarter teaspoon of vanilla bean powder this is crushed up vanilla beans and vanilla pods and we're going to dump that in and stir it through with our heatproof spatula well then take the mixture and pour it into a heat-safe jug well then pour these onto a Silpat mat I'm using my Mac around one because it has a template already on it but you can use a piece of parchment paper you can also use candy molds if you like we'll then sprinkle on our rainbow sprinkles and stick in our lollipops once that comes off the stove this is going to happen really fast that's what we're going to be all prepped and ready to go you [Music] our lollipops

episode of the daily session YouTube channel for cannabis patients and adults as you can see by the title today we're gonna be reviewing on some strawberry banana so let's get right into it guys strawberry banana I believe is a strain by DNA genetics to cooperate collaboration with serious seeds and I believe it's a cross between Crockett's banana cush and a strawberry phenotype of bubblegum so for anything guys let's get a nice smell test for ya wow the berries smell just really smacks you in the face it's very very very sweet it's also got that skunky smell very good smelling wheat

and hail it up guys Cheers I don't know if you got to see that man I got that really close my eyebrows like I said in my video yesterday little bonds are the best for taste we get the full flavor very nice but first thoughts on flavor for the strawberry banana definitely very sweet and I can taste strawberry in it weird it's very sweet it's a different tasting lead-out I like fruity we did so is different good to smoke every now and then strawberry banana is a good strain for stimulating hunger if you if you have problems you know you ain't hungry it's also makes you really happy and euphoric so yeah guys let's take another hit I love this little mama to the chugs man chug so good alright but overall I give the strawberry bananas 9 out of 10 on the smell is it's definitely dank smell I

that would be the lollipop the original lollipop machines were invented in the early 1900s and their output was 40 lollipops in one minute today's machines make almost 6,000 lollipops a minute and one of the biggest lollipop producers is the Spangler candy company the 1920s were all about great invention cars radios television and the birth of the dum-dum lollipop the best thing since sliced bread which was also invented in the 20s people have a wonderful nostalgic feel about dumbness the Spangler Candy Company bought the dum dum brand in 1953 today the fourth generation of Spanglish produces 8 million puffs per day the original sales manager of the Akron Candy Company which developed the dum dum pop thought that Dum Dums was a name that children young children could both say and remember weighing in at only a quarter of an ounce this tiny pop packs a punch after more than 80 years it's the second most popular lollipop in America at the Spangler candy company in Bryan Ohio it all starts with equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar get in a copper kettle in about a year's time for dumpling pops we used about 20 million pounds of sugar and about 20 million pounds after comes out of the copper kettle we add flavoring and coloring and mix it up citric acid from sugar and malic acid from Apple's add sweetness or tartness two different flavors there are ten core flavors in each bag but new flavors are added and old flavors returned every few years so a root beer dumb-dumb might be replaced by pink lemonade butterscotch or a primary mixer needs the candy for five minutes in order to blend the flavor and color throughout each batch then an elevator carries the candy up to a press to flatten it out roll it into a cylindrical shape and then insert the sticks the Pops hit this order where they get ready for dum-dum signature sashay wrapper it's got a little flat four fold on it and one of the nice things about it is it makes it easy to rap there were seven original flavors lemon lime orange coconut pineapple cherry grape and butterscotch but today flavor specialists create new pops based on their list of four hundred potential flavors this is spicy citrus and then we have a dragon fruit and here's a cinnamon bun but how about that mystery flavor that comes in every bag of Dum Dums do you think you know what it is what is this flavor what is a mystery flavor a lot of people say I love your mystery flavors the truth is the mystery flavor is different from batch to batch so they don't have to stop production in between flavors all of our dum-dum lines are continuous and a one batch of grape is followed by a batch of sua say strawberry so there's gonna be a portion of the candy that's gonna be a mixture of strawberry of grape or both mystery solved you never know what flavor combination you're going to unwrap producing two billion dum-dums a year the Spangler lab continues to explore a growing flavor frontier this one is a noir chata flavor it's a Hispanic flavor that's real popular it's a cinnamon creamy type flavor but one flavor in particular generates both complaints and compliment buttered popcorn which is one of the most controversial flavors we've ever had it was hugely popular and hugely unpopular that chocolate dum-dum didn't get a lot of praise either sort of have those flavors that you like or maybe your favorite flavor and it's like going on a little treasure hunt every time you open a bag you know it's just a little sweet moment in the day in a world that's you know not always so sweet", "0tcSVXYyC6U": "hey guys it's Ken from Cuba D productions TV welcome back to a kendama k-- thirsty Thursdays just for you I was in a convenience store this morning and noticed these Jolly Rancher drinks and remembered that a bunch of guys told me about them that they existed I just never seen them before until today soon as I saw them there's a whole shelf of different flavors in the fridge section this one is strawberry and this one's while oh sorry blueberry blue raspberry if I was gonna be a wild berry for a second there and this is a 20 ounce 20 fluid ounce bottle or 591 milliliters and it's a hundred and ten calories per serving and their serving is eight fluid ounces or 240 so it's probably like 220 plus calories per bottle if you drink the whole thing obviously let's go in quickly to do the blue raspberry artificially flavored nose 0% fruit juice and it's a 31 grams of sugar probably again per serving in 35 milligrams of sodium carbohydrates just 31 I don't think it's good I don't think it's going to be oh it is I didn't think it was gonna be carbonated you're that whoa it tastes like you just bit into a raspberry it's got that sour raspberry flavor not overly carbonated Wow artificially flavored a listen tastes like ice artificially flavored tastes like it's got the real juice in there all right let's go into the strawberry there's no name beside strawberry no it's just straight-up strawberry since I opened it up whoa that smells like artificially flavored that doesn't smell like artificially flavored this one's like almost overly scented artificially scented not too keen on the strawberry this should have bought some actual Jolly Ranchers just to compare but this this doesn't taste that good I don't know why whatever flavor they used whatever chemically flavored stuff they used to make it taste like strawberry it didn't do a very good job at all look ingredients carbonated water is the number one thing high fructose corn fructose corn syrup natural and artificial flavor and well it wasn't that good this one's definitely better I'd buy this one over that one any day red loses this would be a would not recommend doesn't really taste like strawberry it just it tastes like a horribly flavoured drink I don't know what I've had better strawberry flavored things that had no juice in it but that would be a would not recommend but this would be a total recommend a Sinkin mate would it be a go out and get it now it's not like blow in my mind for the fact that be like oh my gosh I gotta go and get another one of these it is very good again way better than that not to go out and get it out compared to that but that is a very very nice flavored Jolly Rancher soda so guys there you go if you're interested in grabbing a quick whoa beverage next time you're in a convenience store I totally recommend the Jolly Rancher blue whoo raspberry I keep wanting to say wild and I know that's wrong so blue raspberry give it a shot my recommendation from me to you if you've had them and you have a better idea of a better flavor all there goes my cat if you think there's a better flavor out there let me know in the comments below I'll read through them and I'll go and buy two more flavors and we'll do it in the next couple weeks coming up to do some more reviews of Jolly Ranchers make sure you give me two to compare but definitely this is a wouldn't and a

pink raspberry and red berry you see it comes as a lollipop and a dip now i'm not going to try both of them because that would really mess my teeth up so i think i'm going to go with pink raspberry okay so includes a lollipop and dip i think it's kind of like fun dip okay this is gonna be really hard to open apparently there we go hope the dip doesn't get everywhere so i really like sour patch kids i'm sure these are going to be pretty awesome so let's see yeah that's really good basically just tastes like a sour patch kid got turned into a jolly rancher um yeah if you know what sour patch kids taste like this is pretty much you know what you're getting if you know what sour patch kids taste like this tastes exactly the same except it's a lollipop it's got the um sour candy dipping powder when i saw these on the internet i figured these were going to be really good i think most everybody really likes sour patch kids except if you don't like sour candy yeah it's pretty sour you just taste it let me just try it without the sour on it without the sour dip on it yeah that's really good i really like these a lot out of all the things i've tasted so far in the show except for maybe the detroit style pizza this is probably the best thing i've tried i know traditionally for valentine's day you want to get your you want to get your partner chocolates but i think these would be really good for for valentine's day i actually have a big pack of them that's how i was able to get them the packages the packages the package has hearts on it so i presume that they made these for valentine's day since they're putting out valentine's day candy now valentine's day comes sooner every single year like christmas and halloween but the thing about halloween and valentine's day is the candy's not going to keep for very long i guess everybody wants to try it wants to try the candy wants to have it for a while yeah i'm sure the red berry tastes great too i mean again this isn't one of those things where it's like sour patch kids sometimes are good they're good all the time um you have you know like sour patch kids you have the sour patch watermelon these are really really really good i would be thrilled if i got these for valentine's day and if your partner likes sour candy too they probably would love these for valentine's day they might not even know these are out but i got them on amazon i'm sure you can get them at target walmart whatever yeah these are awesome anyway as always thank you so much for watching have a safe and fun valentine's day and please like always

pops these are fun and easy to make and they're really good okay now let's get on to the story all right so the ingredients that you'll need are sugar Cointreau blue Jolly Ranchers red green and purple and also you will need four appliances lollipop sticks and silicone molds the first step you will need to do and to make these is we need to crush up all of your power Jolly Ranchers except for purple this is because you will need those later on for your dark background then you put your different color matches into your molds separately randomize them for different and cool colors then you want to pre-heat your oven to 275 and then you want to put the Jolly Rancher molds in for 15 to 18 minutes and then when you take out let them cool after these have cooled you want to set these aside and go get your sugar and your corn syrup for this next step you will need a bowl to put your mixture in boil your mixture you will need one and a half cups of sugar 3/4 cups of chords are [Music] and 1/2 cup of water and then you will need to mix it around till it's a big mush and it looks sort of a brown color now you want to boiler your mixture until you get to 300 degrees Fahrenheit stir frequently for good texture and smooth surface for your lollipops now with your mixture you pour some and take each of them home that you'll be using so fold them up next crush your grape Jolly Ranchers do you have a a nice big shake now put the pieces of your grape Jolly Rancher into the molds as you had done you earlier make sure it's good and tight Cicotte whole mold filled up after your grape molds are done put your sticks in and then take your previously made candies and push them on top [Music] next let them cool and then have your own homemade lollipops now the last step of your homemade lollipops is to dig in [Music]", "AnCIJjpixdo": "hey there everybody it's clear in real life and today I'm going to be trying some candy from the Philippines so basically what happened is my dad went on a work trip to the Philippines and he brought me back some candy for me to try and they all look really good and I can't wait to try them so let's do it alright so first I have old puffs it's a mango flavor it says it's mango cream filled with marshmallows oh wait no it wouldn't be mango crisps little modules it's mango cream filled marshmallows that makes a lot more sense and it says oh wow so let's try it this is nice so they come in my grill individually wrapped containers and they feel really fluffy so let's try it these smell good and then there's a little mango and then shows the little marshmallow with the cream so let's try it alright here we have it oh it smells very good very mango e mm-hmm Wow mmm that is really good it's that's too bright there we go so it's very fluffy the marshmallow is very fluffy and it has a very real mango taste like it's very good then it's the cream is very subtle and it's very nice and it's very light and it's not overly sweet it's the right it's like a natural sweet and it's really really amazing and the marshmallow is very light fluffy and it's got like a like a sugary coating on the outside but it's not not overpowered like sometimes the candy in America can be really overly sweet but I've noticed because I've been trying the candies from Japan and now in the Philippines - that they can't the flavor the sweetness is more natural and it's very subtle and it's really nice it's really nice so let's try the next candy so next up we have the happy Cola pop and I like how the packaging is really bright and colorful and there's the ingredients information information and let's try them so it's just like a lollipop and it guys we have confirmation it tastes good I feel like it should and especially if the company is saying it then she tastes good so here is our lollipop but let's try it yeah and so it tastes like Cola and but I have tried with some Japanese candies and the fist can sometimes be overpowering and a lot of fizz but this is just a little bit of fizz which it's really good the only thing I would have liked is if the lollipop stick could be a little bit longer because I kind of feel like it's falling out of my hand at points and but other than that it's really good it's really good so let's try an excandesco and we have is Phillips Tarzan bubblegum and I was looking at the packaging and it has instructions and it says please just go please dispose of chewed gum responsible it says wrap gum in original wrapper and scarred into a garbage bin so like they don't want other people stepping in gum which i think is nice Oh oh it fell but I love how I love how the packaging is very talent so I got it blue but they come in a bunch of different colors there's gold the blue green yellow there's green another green and a pink in there there's all these different types oh no they're falling out that's nice well notice about these candies is that you get a lot of candy with these not just like a little tiny thing like a lot of candy so I think I'm gonna try the gold because I think the gold wrapping it looks really pretty there's the gum oh how hard to choke with bubble gum in my mouth but yeah it's just tastes like it's again the flavor is subtle which is nice but it tastes like the pink bubble gum flavor like if you know the original like the bubble gum flavor it tastes like that but this is nice it's like the right size of gum and it tastes really good too and then I also like that there's a lot of gum in there there's not just a little bit so we'll be able to last you a while this is really good so let's see our our necks candy so the next candy I'm going to try is Fox's crystal-clear fruits I don't know what this is it might be like a hard candy its packaging kind of reminds me of Mentos which are here in the United States and let's open it up it kind of unrolls that it is like a hard candy so it's like a little orange one and we have there's also like a purple I'm assuming that could be like a grape and they are they're not crystal clear but they are translucent and then there's like a white issue and then the purple there's nornes let's try a the whitish oh maybe this is like pineapple or something really good let's try hmm hard candy but oh it's a good little with like a lemon it's like a citrusy lemon flavor mm-hmm Wow that taste taste really good it's especially the lemon I have to say like that was really awesome cuz it mmm it's so good again it's very natural it's very just it tastes like a real fruit that's really good these are mmm we're supposed to put the lemon it's really nice it's really refreshing so the final candy that we have are these Chupa Chups milky so it kind of looks like it's a strawberry milk lollipop so let's see we got our scissors everything's ready to try our the Chupa Chups so again I really like this it comes with the oh they're all they're all connected oh okay so you get as you can see a lot here you can bond into little shapes Oh hard for little shape there we go the heart again very easy to open it smells really fantastic but yet again the lollipop stick is so short I don't know who these who they're making them for it's like they're making them for little babies there's so the law the stick is so tiny it's the size of my thumb I get very small hands but smells amazing hmm it's oh wow these are really good it's taste like strawberry milk like you know how there's chocolate milk it tastes like strawberry milk good well it lives up to its name strawberry milk milky strawberry and cream lollipop but these are really good again the flavor is very subtle but the cream flavor is also really nice and really soothing and the design looks really cool because it's stinking glam but it's got a really cool like marble design and that's also really really nice all right so those were all the candies that I tried today I still have more I have a part two video coming up soon so stay tuned for that and post in the comments about what your favorite candy is from around the world or even the country that's a little different or a little unusual because it's always cool to experiment

"sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "neOErb5QOck": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the sour patch kids a lollipop with sour candy dipping powder there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "zz1YApGkOAQ": "this is sour strawberry same thing grown with high pressure sodium and how I like I had for 1000 watt genesis high-pressure sodium puffs and three 600 watt in between and there's a linear straight down of a narrow room seven foot by twenty and it was three 600 watt extra side highlights between them this is a dense blood I'm squeezing it and it don't budge it off they weigh a lot heavier than they look we sit down your butt is lighter size comparison and this earth grew stout or easy when we thicker stems well supporting itself really big butts that's just an average side but a lot of them I break down to smaller sizes off the stem even a large Cola or terminal but at the top I break it down to smaller blacks this earth is sour lemony a slightly sweet wood a hint of fruit in it is not really expensive I flushed all of these about three weeks with clear water after going organic with the soil for the worm castings compost a little bit of Steve Bergman of bat guano and organic amendments and coco peat our College I'm Coco core I do a super soil mix myself where I use mostly coco peat then peat moss then organic topsoil then compost manure humus and worm castings then Steve bird and bat guano kelp mill rock phosphate which is an organic substance which is actually ancient dinosaur bones and marine seashells and stuff that has broken down into a bone like rock that's full of phosphorus and I use soil inoculants like mycorrhizae fungi to work as a beneficial additive a living part of the soil they interact with the fine hair roots and allows the plant to consume more of the organics in the soil and then I use soil natural bacteria microorganisms worm castings is one of my favorite additives and then I make a compost tea with molasses worm castings bat guano seabird guano kelp meal and my coast tea just full of microorganisms I've put a hare stone in a five-gallon bucket and I'm bubbly for about three days and I string that and water the plants like that and like I said last three weeks I just flush it with clear filtered water and I always run my water to a carbon whole house water filter before I use and then let it sit some of that I use from my my fish pond I'm gonna

done that though next is the mixing since these are sugar free will be using xylitol so first to get half a cup of xylitol okay and the next you'll have half a teaspoon of cream of tartar okay guys I screwed up and accidentally put half a tablespoon in but hopefully it'll be fine so yeah okay next will be 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid just in case you're wondering use cream of tartar there sick citric acid fabric okay so yeah here it oh okay so just gonna get that again one time we put too much citric acid in then what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix it all around so then next what we do is we stick this thing and then we stick it like right there like in the middle of the oven and it's pretty hot as you can see 25 minutes hmm so then you cook it for 25 minutes and then you start it yay okay so you have to do this part very quickly so what we're doing is we're putting coconut spray inside I like you know like the lollipop molds right now so then what I got to do is you know like I'm gonna get like one drop of red food coloring and then one drop whoa that's fine it'll do it'll just be it'll just be red then I guess and then no and then the flavor will be Barbie and then I put Barbie and cream in and then you'll need to mix it up and then what we'll do is we're pour it in there okay so we put the liquid in the lollipop molds and we uh put the lollipop sticks there now just let it dry for four hours", "itzoVn1MYrY": "hi everyone um today is the next day it's sunday and yeah and i'm so excited because i have one more week of school until my spring and all spring fall vacation and right now if you guys are wondering why am i doing this video it's because i'm tasting a little lollipop i've been tasting a lot of lollipops in this package and yeah so this is what it looks like let me just spread it out so this is what it looks like we ate all we need the rest in here so yeah this is what the pasta package is supposed to look like there's blue pink um blue pink and pink and green and we taste all of those but except for this yellow one right here so we're gonna taste it and we ate all the rest and the one that i don't really like is the cherry blossom it's so sweet for me that i don't really like it and here's the back so we ate the rest but we're gonna taste this one this is a lemonade one so um this one there's another one there's like there was three in this so this is the one it's the chupa tubes lollipop package and um i'm gonna taste this one i just opened mine um and as you can see the the um brightest yellow is on the top and the light yellow is on the bottom and we're gonna try it it smells like soup like curry floss soup and like that'd be so gross if if it is made out of it so we're gonna try it okay three two one uh that tastes gross no this tastes like this tastes like oh my god i taste this tastes familiar that i don't like it this is like old spray yeah just old spray and then the top when i eat the top it's not good the bottom's not even either so no no let me get into this guys this is disgusting i don't really like it i bet my sister's gonna like it because she is a baby oh my god oh i got juice guava juice and then we have like animals there's a whole pack of this it's 36. look how much 36. look how much it is and there's like more over there hold on don't mind my uncle the football is playing today look how much we only we only only ate this row and like there's two more so that's crazy and i have cocoa puffs um i'm going to show you something guys so yeah i really want corn but i cannot make it so yeah egg you know so that's what i had um i think i told you guys before tomorrow i think i told you guys yesterday that i was gonna do a room tour um and i did say i might do it today because it's the weekend and i have a birthday at three o'clock um the pool was really fun today i mean tomorrow um yesterday it was really fun but i got to see my cousin birthday i mean not on birthday um i got to see my cousin's um baby which is i think it i think his name is like jariah yeah his name is jarya um he was super cute he really liked me keep on staring at me wherever i go so yeah it's really nice it's really nice seeing babies and it makes you feel happy enough and then just enjoying your life because um i know um it's the pandemic going on and a lot of things are happening you know you'll never know there might be another lockdown or maybe this year of the coronavirus might end ocular 19 because this year has been totally rough and i believe that if we spread spread um love teamwork by wearing our masks keeping a shutter six feet away and just hand sanitizing make sure everybody's safe i think that will make a faster to the whole world um to get better because i really think that this needs to stop you know it's from a like a certain animal and i think we really need to eat because we're bigger than animals like small animals or tiny animals so yeah i think we really need to um work together and that makes me feel sad because we never had this before um this is not the worst year by the way and there was a worse worse worse here in this since instead of this time so i really think that it's important to learn the plan um teamwork because you can do teamwork with anybody you know um the world changes and the word changes a lot and that doesn't mean that it doesn't have to say this stay the same because last uh most of the years we never weared masks and things got changing bad stuff had happened last year's all those years through what happened and then since now this is a serious conversation so anyone who doesn't respect the world or anybody i don't think that you should do this stuff i mean we we have our rights everyone has the rights no matter where you go no matter where you are no matter what time it is no matter what will happen we have our rights but we need to respect and stay safe and just let teamwork in our community you know i feel like that i mean it's not the end of the world it's only the pandemic because it's caused by a animal a certain strange animal and it lives far away i believe and we're bigger than that more than a animal we're bigger than that since only that certain one animal were bigger than one animal one person or animal we're bigger than that we can make teamwork we can save our lives we can teamwork we can teamwork and i feel like that's important because mostly all the time i felt i know people are bored in their homes and i feel like that needs to change because we need to put everything back to normal and if we want that back we need to get teamwork you know so have more fun and go out without marrying a mass but maybe next year will be a great great year more than this so it doesn't matter if 2020 is crazy it's only because we're focusing on the pandemic it's only it's not our fault that we did the pandemic it's because that it was the animal because it's not our fault of course we're gonna we're not gonna do anything to the world like just like make a big disaster in the world that's crazy and it's not fair that we have to stay home and i know we have to stay home because everyone has their rights so yeah i wanted to do this video to talk about pandemic and tasting that crazy lollipop so i hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys smash that like

CooCoo and today I'm sharing with you guys my Christmas in July DIY so the summer is a great time to get some crafting done before the busyness of the holiday set in this year out front I want to do a whole gingerbread candy land theme and summer is also the perfect time to pick up pool noodles so let me show you what you'll need for this project first I picked up two of each color of pool noodles from the Dollar Tree as well as some colored duct tape I also picked up some of this clear wrap now out of this one roll you can wrap 2 of our giant lollipops then you'll need a plunger yes a toilet plunger from the Dollar Tree one for each lollipop and I just pulled out some white paint I had on hand to go ahead and paint it to look like a candy stick you'll also need lots of hot glue I also figured out rubber bands came very much in handy for this project let's get started the first thing I did was remove the sticker from my plunger and I left the plunger portion on as it made a handy stand for me to paint it I went ahead and gave each plunger two coats of paint letting them dry thoroughly in between and after and now we'll just set it aside and get started on our pool noodles remove your stickers from both then we're going to glue them end and I used my hot glue for this and once I had held them in place to stick for a few minutes I went ahead and added a layer of duct tape to secure them now let's go ahead and take our duct tape up to the top and get started on striping our candy so just start at the top winding it evenly removing any bumps and then it became quite easy to go ahead and tuck in the top portion doing this on a large flat surface definitely made it more easy I would just pull the tape out and then roll my noodle continuing all the way to the bottom before I snipped off my tape and tucked it in now I found where both the duct tapes met and decided which side was going to be on the outside and which part I was going to hide inside of the Roll I did find out that doing just about two or three passes of hot glue is more than enough it's most important to hold it in place while eight dries so for that we're going to go ahead and pull out those rubber bands I mentioned after you've glued it together and secure it so that it can continue to dry for at least 10 or 15 minutes now it's time to attach our candy stick once your noodle has dried it's time to remove the rubber bands and get started attaching our stick so you can do this with either a razor blade or scissors I just poke my scissors in twice to make an X and then go ahead and start cutting to connect those little triangles and then you can remove them then you're going to want to stick your scissors through to sort of puncture the next two layers and sort of carp it out now it's time for our hot glue I filled it up with quite a bit before 6:00 my stick pushing it down through three layers and letting it dry now we're going to do our clear wrap you may want to have on hand a rubber band or a zip tie before you get started on this just measure out the amount that you like go ahead and cut it and then it's time to wrap it around your lollipop gathering it around the bottom before securing it with either a rubber band or ribbon you could stop here I decided to pull out some white ribbon I had on hand and use it as a bow so I'm using two zip ties removing that rubber band and some ribbon I had on hand just securing the first zip tie and then snipping off the bottom to create the bow turning it over and tightening the second zip tie and again snipping off the bottom and that's all there is to it I just love them and I know if I were to go to a store and try and buy them they would cost me so much more they only cost me 450 apiece I'm really relieved to know that I've already knocked out this DIY and they'll be waiting for me to decorate the front of our home come December I hope you guys enjoyed seeing this Christmas in July DIY thank you so much for watching and I'll see you back very soon in the next video you", "dMaHAtYXIqc": "how do you [ __ ] duty what is up in CB squad babe says your two hosts friendly neighborhood vapors Matt and Pat

like a small channel started out it's been around probably for like a while actually I'm not sure but he's pretty damn cool reviews I really like his juice reviews they're very thorough so I'll put his channel link down below so you guys could check that out as well so shout out to you uh oh my god I was like Wrigley his first name I just can't think of it off the top now it's all about that vapor anyways get on with this review so what's the flavor description on this bad boy so flavor description is strawberry sour straws eliquid sour straws takes a sweet strawberry and licorice taste and covers it generously and sour coming that is so good that we challenged you to believe to be able to handle it I mean we'll be having a comparison video we will compare the bazooka sour straws to the re-up red delight so keep your eyes peeled for that review coming out and stuff anyways let's top it small here you get someone from bottle one smoke from the RDA suppose nice smells nice kinda smells like a mix between a ripe strawberry like a candied stronger than me yeah yeah as I seem same smell as it's the watermelon just put the strawberries like the same it's got like that belty kind of smell do you think like it smells like almost strawberry sour belts like like that belt II kind of almost reminds me of like the these the sour strap should accept the sour strap way way too strong dude hard to explain like how that [ __ ] tastes but uh so we're gonna be using the dub PO twisted messes box mod with the twisted messes version one gold sitting on top got some fuse Clapton's in there I went out to a point one two those are 24 gauge core can't fall with 36 gauge stainless steel outside got it in 105 watts using some whole foods or getting 365 cotton there we go yeah it's got that same kind of Bell tea flavor almost is off what the [ __ ] seller straps sour straps looks similar to the nectar sour stuff too you know the nectar sour just like strawberry with a bit of sour didn't even want he has to kiss our belts to me sounds like that gun kind of camera gummy candy flavor in there kind of makes it taste like a yeah well of course you can for whatever the [ __ ] they lot in the description and [ __ ] just to try to make it different yeah sourdough I mean that's really what a sour strong [ __ ] in these really think about it dude basically a sour bill that's good it's pretty good I want to smooth for the most part to it something under nicked it's not too overly sour like the UH blue raspberry it's pretty good I want to say that like the watermelon are neck-and-neck I want to give like that like I want to say like a seven million seven point five or something like that I think we gave the watermelon loud like this actually I kind of like the watermelon a little bit more though side I probably I'd probably say seven for this one it's good 2699 two for the 200-mile ball that's a good deal definitely so make sure look out for that comparison video those will rate this between the red delight by Rhea but overall this will give this juice to seven seems we're me and Pat both stand it's smooth Scott could play for a good price point I definitely give it a thumbs up and a recommendation if you're thinking about looking for some type of strawberry belts eliquid there's a lot of them out there and stuff and a lot of them are good for the most part because they're all about the same yeah somewhere a little bit better than others so that in mind but uh what do you say Pat I say I say it's definitely definitely something like we're checking out maybe like it's definitely something you can like I could keep my rotation watermelon yeah let me know the oh babe I like the watermelon do your goodbyes and stuff I could buy a 200 mil

throughout this holiday season today's video is going to be for a super fun and easy 5 minute lollipop video and this is really customizable you can put in whatever flavors extracts colors you can make it really unique and sparkle with different sprinkles or candies so I hope you guys enjoy it and you can check out my other glass candy video it's a very popular video on this channel I'll link that in the description box below if you want to check that out as well and if you want to see more DIYs like this please give this video a big thumbs up I would love that step one is to combine 1/2 a cup of sugar with a quarter cup of light corn syrup for this particular recipe I recommend that or Lyle's golden syrups only step two is to give it a stir it will be crazy thick but that's what you want step three is to cook your candy in two minute increments and you can find the recipe link in my description box there are two very important facets to consider when creating this candy and number one is to be very careful the sugar syrup will get very hot so you don't want to walk away from it you want to keep your eye on it and number two is a very important factor as well probably the most important and is that you want your candy to reach 300 degree Fahrenheit this way your finished product isn't too brittle or too soft and gooey and that it's just right but beyond that you can really have fun and have creative Liberty and inject in some edible glitter or whatever your heart desires step 4 is to pour and decorate and I'll link in my description box the lollipop sticks

Bebop Oh a classic anime from the 90s back when the aunt what Oh or not okay let them what are we reviewing Oh oh sweet aunt jemima alright well this is something called a scorpion pop and it happens coming a blueberry flavor of course because when you're actually eating a scorpion you don't want that tricky poison to come kill you that would be now you don't want to taste the poison this is the first time I've ever actually had to put my life in danger for a can you review I don't know how active the stinger is or if I'm gonna have some sort of allergic reaction to this thing but I do it all for you I do it all for the people this is from a company called hot licks and they're notorious for making all sorts of weird candy infused treats I mean from chocolate-covered maggots to barbeque crickets yes barbecue crickets they don't seem to have a filter as to where to stop so alright I'm kind of afraid of eating this thing one thing I should note is that it's really heavy like I don't know what this scorpion ate before he died was really weighing this thing down alright well let's go ahead and crack this bad boy in half oh boy there it is and then it looks a lot more terrifying and light than it did in the packaging actually this reminds me of this old SAP candy I used to get back in the pic back in the 90s basically what they would do is they would take the sap from trees which I know comes naturally and just court of occasion and sell it it was like maple honey this is like maple death alright here we go now let's go ahead and okay let's go ahead and now let's go ahead and say good take a dirt oh why is it so crunchy why does it taste like I'm eating a giant cheeto oh okay this is the one thing I truly regret eating at the same time I don't regret eating because for one thing the blueberry flavor sort of tastes like cotton candy surprising that's for one thing but the Scorpion it tastes like a toenail clipping that's been sitting on your desk for the past two weeks if I had to compare it to something scary well you know that big ball of foil that sits in the back your fridge you know the one your parents ain't never ever to touch yeah well I imagine that's

went to see her home and I found some juicy juicy a team clearly cinnamon was lying to all of us I mean she told us she went on a date at that cottage without late for it but she was lying she never went out with him because when I went through her phone iPhone attacks and a guy les cinnamon on bread several times like she complexing him where are you why aren't you picking me up and he just never replied so either he realized that Oh H or he just never existed I'm going to assume that he never existed but honestly cinnamon as a witch to her place of doubling with that being mm-hmm also

lot because cinnamon husband am I aim for the past like weakest week-and-a-half I have a new C huh and every time like a rhubarb and I would like her she wouldn't reply or it would be like really flying like a dog you know like what was she doing here what she wears it's just really sauce but I will get to the bottom of this I sought to confirm if Tut's and cinnamon weren't actually together I've heard don't worry I have sources in every city in this entire country some and other continents how do you think I know what cinnamon is doing when she's in Paris I have French sources so that's all I can offer you right no I will be doing some more digging the way I always dig I'm like a little groundhog it just was the game I will get to the bottom of this and cinnamon hmm don't think you

strawberry slices it's supposed to taste like Twizzlers candy and here's the thing if it tastes that good that means you've got a all natural pretty much fat-free sugar-free except for sugar that's in the fruit treat for you and your family so I thought I would try this little did I know when you slice up these strawberries and bake them in the oven you put some parchment paper down on the tray it takes 3 hours to do this because it's only on like 210 degrees so it does take a while and I also found out if you slice them a little too thin watch them because they get a little brown see that one kind of burned but I didn't have better luck with the thicker slices of strawberries like this one so now we're gonna see does this taste it does it taste like Twizzlers candy I love Twizzlers so here we go oh that's kind of squishy tastes like a strawberry oh so we don't do not BAM I think was far as saying they taste like Twizzlers but if you like to eat like the special cave with the strawberries in there a little serious and the dried strawberries that's what this tastes like and I strawberry so for a quick treat it's almost more like to me squishy like a fruit roll-up we saw natural so Twizzlers not so much but I tasty little snack when you don't burn them mm-hmm that's the key watch these don't cut them too thin like I did there I should onto them so now you can try it

mm-hmm need some chilli powder don't get in there that'd be good but these are okay Jolly Ranchers aren't hugely sweet they're just very lightly sweet victim to me anyway okay along the end it there Jolly Ranchers watermelon sucker lollipop I thank y'all for watching I appreciate it let me know if you've tried I mean how much difference is this all the apart from just the regular candies I wouldn't think be very that much different I mean nothing special for Valentine's Day just they just put it in a sucker and made it a cart right okay well I think y'all watch and I appreciate it we'll see on next one", "fLA_lx1gku4": "hey you there you're watching candy surgeon today we're going to talk about push pops no I'm not telling you to shove your father I'm talking about some of the best candies that capture the hearts of 90's kids everywhere push pop is a part of a line of candies that include baby bottle pop juicy drop pop and ring pop you see me here pulling the top part by the plastic but I mean you're going to take the plastic off eventually and you will have to push it from under as expected the great thing about push pop is that you can save some for later by putting the top back on which is a great advantage over similarly flavored lollipops from the wide variety of push pop I've tried I really don't think there's a bad flavor or a overwhelmingly preferable flavor I mean I think that the candies are but from a good base and you can just dive into any flavor so if you're up to it I suggest you try to push pop as soon as you can", "gsp17MQ6yqU": "[Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ngoSbRl6css": "hi everyone this is gonna be a quick DIY on this lollipop flowers that I'm making for Leah's birthday slash baptism it's coming up on May 9th and I just wanted to show you guys how to make them in case you want to use on the ass you know table decorations or something like that so I'm using dum dum lollipops and the reason for this is because they are small and pretty easy to handle with and also my sister and I picked them because she's the one with that came up with the idea so yeah and also just take regular tape and you're gonna use whatever kind of paper or not paper Sprenger that you want and what I'm doing right now is I am just getting a long string I'm sorry for the background noise Aliyah is favorite toy and yeah all I'm gonna do is just grab a piece and rip it and also get a piece of tape it could be maybe like six inches long smaller however you want it to be but the shorter you do it it gives your your lollipop like that more flowery look so yes you can see I taped it down to the table oh it's not taped down to the table but I put it on the opposite side of the sticky side so I can just easily tape the the paper the paper I keep on saving paper the springer into the tape directly and after that I'm just gonna like kind of like fold it and like tape it and fold it a bit hold it is it's something really easy it's hard to get used to but once you know how to do it and you do the first two or three you'll get the hang of it I promise another thing I forgot to tell you guys or I almost forgot to tell you guys is that don't tape your springer all the way down just leave it halfway down so the other little part or extra tape that you have fit there you're gonna use it to tape that to your lollipop so yeah just be careful and don't take the springer all the way down okay so now I'm just gonna grab my lollipop and I'm gonna start taping it from the stick of my lollipop and then it's just gonna work itself through and it's gonna just work its way up and that's totally fine if the tape just you know starts going up towards the lollipop it's actually going to make it look more like a flower because it's gonna make it look more puffy so it's fine as you can see here I had some trouble and just keeping it in one place but I noticed that if I just let it keep them going up and then I just had to do what it wants to do it'll actually make it look more puffy and more pretty see I told you guys there it is this is the final look and however you don't have to put it or I just have it now which is in the Springer you don't have to put it there I just put it there so I could show you guys but thank you all for watching don't forget to Like subscribe comment down below and I'll see

also carry an assortment of nostalgic and novelty candy and one of those includes a scepter with a cricket in it this is a new product for us so we've just had them about a week this is a new product that we are carrying in our store and that I know of no one has tried it yet but we do have a volunteer here Megan who is going to try it for you I'm a brave soul here we go there's the cricket are you chewing it mm-hmm what's it taste like what what's its um what's it taste like I'm taste like chicken was a crunchy earth very crunchy I'm very sweet a gag gift or serious skip lots of Croteam ma'am bring up", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day

vegetarian locally manufactured but the license of this company that fitting lick on the top and see it change color I think that's the monster but the top embedded portion is missing please ask for a replacement so that part is not that you can ask for a replacement and I don't know how they old I take it without an opening and I don't know how they would take that without opening the packaging okay that's real and now this is how it looks compared to what's on the packaging let's try let's see the events that was a mistake looks like this it's supposed to look like this and this was a big stick but I think this makes more sense those are monster then this let's try the color-changing part and see if it works yep you can see it's already faded it was on this color now it's this again the insider that candy tastes like mint deep level the outer part is a mango the packaging shows a dramatic color changes like the whole thing changes in their local er and then the orange but only the top part of it changes as you can see dot because it's raw mango but the interior is quite sweet so combine the tastes quite nice this should have one with that this well this again the glow come up with the type of ice have you slept around today kipper doing a few mod mices", "0bf4NtxIhNY": "hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later thank you so much and I can't wait to see you guys on the next video see you later bye", "p6Sb_7hm0XU": "hey there and welcome to Ali's allergies the show where I Ali I'm allergic to everything and today we are trying young earth organic pots which are lollipops very exciting at this point I kinda have to ask am I actually eating things to review them or just just fan service which I have to answer the only fan service if you have fans follow  anyway this looks like their variety of flavors smells like a dentist's office which i guess is unsurprising considering the lollipops are the favorite candy of children who are terrified of orthodontists strawberry smash smash or wet face watermelon I can't quite tell lots of flavors listed on the on the front here wide variety and young earth is the same time for me that made the gummy bears that I had and they are very big on including no GMOs and and I don't give a  about GMOs if somebody makes a genetically modified wheat it doesn't have gluten in it so that I can have normal flower again i will give you as much money as i pay for the gluten free that tastes to everyone has bad textures i'm not going to give you a million dollars because i don't have it but i will give you like five dollars for a bag of lollipops seems like a  steel to me and this is much smaller than like a bag of lollipops you would get for halloween and much more expensive um so yeah I guess I'm I guess I'm trying whatever the this is that I can't quite tell some of these are the same flavors is the gummy bears the gummy bears also have pomegranate pucker and perfectly phn googly grape it's not gooey grape it's googly grape goog ly grave like that's an odd thing to call a grape-flavored item very very cheery makes sense wutface watermelon seems a little inappropriate for a children's product perfectly peach makes sense but like what the is going on with you you mer i'm now very confused I'm very curious anyway so yes this is what I'm going to try and I still can't tell which flavor it is it's kinda like the texture of a warhead and this warheads do you remember warheads 90s kids will remember um and everybody else will just suffer because if somebody tries to hand you want to try to be mean to you I like them but a lot of people don't anyway I'm like not super excited about this I don't actually like lollipops that much but smells okay wow it's really good um yeah I do feel very strange about eating this on camera also i know it will take a while and i'm not going to try to like crunch it up into pieces because i don't have super awesome teeth um which like you can see my smile I've got my little gold corners like yeah this little this this is probably harder than my gold crowns like I don't think smashing it up is a good idea but it's really a little bit tart it's really good it's really really good it does feel like it's going to eventually like lacerate my tunnel like normal hard candies do which I guess means they got the texture of corn syrup right yeah that's delicious I still don't know if it's strawberry or watermelon but now I want to eat like I was worried that it was going to take me like a year to finish this bag of lollipops I'm not longer worried about that this is very tasty um I'm not going to break into any others because I don't want to just suck on candy on camera because it's weird but these are very tasty if you have kids who have issues with gluten you have issues with artificial flavors if you're concerned about corn syrup and your kids products which unless the corner allergic you realistically should be nothing and science says the corn is dangerous for you or the corn syrup is any more problematic than they get any other kind of fructose syrup but if you have a cubic corn allergies like this is this tastes very good this is delicious and them yeah i'm i'm gonna eat there after this and it's going to destroy my lipstick so i'm also going to I trying to camera off for that purpose anyway thanks for watching this is ali and this has been a leader jeez like and subscribe and yeah we'll see i have a couple things on thinking of doing but i only have like 15 subscribers at the moment so maybe when i reach a certain number of subscribers i will do

bunch of candy and i'll see you soon bye", "xWwZphvhY8k": "good morning good afternoon good evening I'm here with my mindless wife Laura I'm here with my skull husband Nathan and we're here for a very quick very tasty Halloween video well I don't agree on a tasty but spooky and Halloweeny yes so these are chopper chops lollipops but they're in the shape of a skull and they're two flavors with an amazing taste yeah that makes you lose your mind if we lick a baby's a different flavor their strawberry oh my yeah I don't recall strawberry lime being a staple in the chopper chops um they're also they also have a like bag of face shaped chopper chaps I assume this is just an extension of that just Halloween I saw the candy cane chump chops yeah to again this year okay yeah we've got a video of those all not on this channel but I think that would be up on our that was our Food Channel anyway let's crack into this can I open up one yes cause they are both the same and Laura does not like lion nor the event in two lollipops also if anyone thinks this is weird that we're both trying the same Molly pop we are husband and wife we did you just will live we I thought we're dating no anyone who is wondering by the way if you're just here for our food reviews they are Mondays and Wednesdays very nice if you're all kind of smoke if you're just wanting to watch the food reviews that's when you'll find them hmm it smells like artificial I'm gonna lick the brain so the brain is the lime part which does actually have a bit of brain detail which is maybe a bit tricky on camera and the bottom is the strawberry which is a little bit more see-through would you say like it's a different is read like a solid like you haven't they've the crema like flavor isn't that's more traditional so the strawberry tastes just like they're regular strawberry flavor the lime is definitely blimey yeah oh yeah that that's like lime cordial so it'll taste but cheap lime cordial like home brand lime cordial um the strawberries okay it's an artificial strawberry sort of lollipop the lime is not for me but I don't like lime but give you a like strawberry in line to get you you know might be all right for you but suddenly marks on there weirdly um yeah not not for me I'll be honest so hey what was really cool about these was I got these at 7-eleven that a massive plastic skull that looked identical to this on the stand with the actual robots were stuck inside the actual stand I think was cool it Ilocos themselves this is something though that might be quite a bit of fun for kids and then who knows how long they'll hang around they probably just fallaway yeah why clearly they're very for Halloween yes oh yeah get more lost if you enjoyed watching this video give us a thumbs up let us know hey well let us know down below if you are eating sucking on ooh you got something stuck to it um lollipops and what your sort of favorite flavor would be doesn't have to be a chopper chop mine was cherry but you can't get it here anymore and that makes me sad I'm very sorry to hear that blue snakes and Ellen bags snakes bring them back bring that whole bag of them actually yeah press

we always try taki's products right so i've made a playlist if you guys want to go check it out it's under playlist on my channel of all the takis products we've ever tasted so we're going to be um starting on that trend i mean the um series yeah that series again and we're going to be trying to get um other taking flavors online and in stores so i was just at walgreens okay whatever i was just at walgreens okay so and then i saw these we got some takis lollipops guys legit there's a lot in here i know there's street i thought there was this one um so i got two packs one for me one for my brother i wonder if the tacky powder actually tastes like coffee powder so here it is hockey suego this is how the lollipop look here's the packaging actually so yeah we're just gonna get right into it open these up so each pack contains three pocky lollipops and one taki is shaped like a sake a taki so here we go so if you guys thought this is made out of clay i made it let me know what you guys think down below i made it out of clay and i'm painting it red but let's actually get right into the video so here's how one looks looks pretty cool and then it says it comes with chamois acid lollipop with chili pepper powder if you guys don't know i've been in a cache for about a month okay so let me explain the cast situation my god no okay so i was in a cast an actual cast for about two weeks and i got this bad boy on for another two more four more weeks but i have two more weeks in this and i'm done so yeah let's get right into this thing you already opened it how did you open it oh you just went like this like a bag of cheese okay so holy okay so it doesn't look anything like the packaging i know i think the lollipop just looks like a massive dookie on a stick my guys so it doesn't work on the top not at all so not even from the bottom like on the packaging you can see that there's a hole put it on the bottom and there's no hole so here we go let's just get right into it ready three two one yup oh oh it's so hot and sour can't hop kind of just all went down my throat tastes pretty good i like it i don't like it it's too dry let's see if i can get the lollipop what do you mean like just try to get all the powder off guys i'll be back i guess it's just me now i don't like it it's too dry it's pretty yes it nasty to me it is it just looks like tahin yeah that's the powder for the lollipops that you dip the lollipop in pretty good it's pretty nasty to me where would your rating be no i'll give it a five out of ten i would give it a six and a half it's not the best it burns my lips yeah it's pretty hot for a lollipop it doesn't remind me like anything of a taki i don't know but you're just a giant blob tastes like a hot lollipop any mexican lollipop actually this is what it tastes like okay so yeah this one looks like tahin just more grounded up because look it's like finer than baking here it is and then we're just gonna dip it again uh i don't really like the powder but the lollipop's okay okay so i brought myself some water so i could try to get the powder off because it literally just started in the package with the powder on that so guys i'm gonna explain something to you guys the reason we haven't been uploading a lot is because quarantine i've been doing is staying inside you know so it hasn't been giving us much content i'm gonna try to bring you guys more content you know i haven't uploaded in a month gotta gotta bring the vlog central back to literally you know someone i used to upload every day i ran out of videos guys drop some comments below of what should i upload the lollipop by itself is not too bad i just don't like the powder yeah that's what i said are we done here because it looks the same okay so my rating was uh six and a half miles of five just five so yeah thank you guys for watching please subscribe like and comment i'll see you guys in the next one", "SDOkqQD1cc4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey what's up guys and welcome to a brand new episode of spike reviews now today i'm reviewing a product that i didn't even know existed now i've reiterated this fact many many times over but you guys know that i am in love with talkies and i have a fixation for them and i love them so i'm wearing purple for a reason this is apparently a brand new takis related product in candy form so needless to say i'm excited and i got a whole box of them yeah so it contains six portions of the candy it is chamoy flavored lollipop with chili and it's by barcell the people the company that makes takis of course and that's all the information that's on the outside is a very plain box it looks like a box that you would set up at a store so i think i got the big boy industrial version it says cut and remove so let's go ahead and unbox this because yeah i'm interested i didn't even know this product existed to be honest so uh yeah try and do our best here oh there we go there's one two one more side it's full of tape that's why it's so hard oh there we go there we go look at this look at this oh okay okay it's not focusing [Music] dang that's a big bag there's six of them all right let's get one out let's save the rest for later oh okay oh damn this is this is definitely a uh display box here so i was thinking that it was gonna be six portions with one lollipop per portion but apparently according to the bag there are three lollipops with chili powder to dip so this is like a very very mexican version of a dippin pop what are they called dipping dipping pop so swim swamy slippy slappy slimming salmon simmons swan swenson swanson lolli dip whatever i don't remember right now but i'll put it on the screen i don't know why i can't remember but this is the very very mexican version right here the takis version of that candy um but yeah apparently one of these bags is three portions so it's an unboxing within an unboxing so let's dig into this all right let's see what we got inside i'm loving how that smells it reminds me of those mango chili pops that hispanics grew up with man i love those things this smells just like that and uh it has a little bit of a tacky smell to it too alright so each one of these bags six bags to a box a big boy size this one's stuck there we go so each one of those bags has three individual little bags so that's that's a lot of candy that's a lot of portions hopefully i like this because i have so many uh who knows maybe i'll give one away hmm maybe i'll have a little giveaway i should have giveaway alright so here it is takis fuego lollipop with dip now i'm really curious to see if the lollipop's actually shaped like a takis or if it's incredibly deformed uh like a lot of candy is why are we still here [Music] just to suffer so let's see 70 calories nobody cares about that it's candy if you're eating candy you're not looking at the calories [Music] mouth is watering already all right opened one up we'll save the rest for later alright let's smell test don't breathe that in kids that's very strong all right smells delicious and it has a lot of powder about that much powder in the bag which doesn't seem like a lot but there's a lot of sodium in here so that's plenty you don't need any more than that so here's the lollipop kind of looks like a taki kind of not really there it is it's already it's already very heavily covered in that powder so i guess i won't have to do much dipping for the first dip for the first taste test i guess so uh yeah cheers let's just dig in is this tos am i gonna have to [Music] you'll get the uncensored version on another website yeah all right but in all honesty that's pretty good oh there it goes now you can actually see the little uh shape of the takis the little roll i guess that you would see on a rolled takis corn chip so kind of similar but the taste pretty good this uh man this is bringing bringing childhood flashbacks right here growing up in a hispanic household ah so good so good that's good that's really good now i will say does it taste like the takis seasoning that comes on the chips kind of not really it tastes more like the traditional chili powder that you get and you come to expect with the mexican tamarindo candy and i probably should have paid more attention to the packaging here because the reason it tastes so similar to that mexican candy is because it's a collaboration look at this right here on the wrapper is takis and vero vero is the company that makes those mango lollipops full of chili powder that we all love so much growing up uh so it makes sense as to why it tastes exactly like that lollipop probably should have looked at the packaging a little closer but still very tasty this is the collaboration of childhood mexican dreams the collaboration that dreams are made out of but uh yeah so this is a winner for me i mean it did y'all expect anything else from ataki's product when it comes to me reviewing it come on now all right simple enough i'm gonna have to give this product a 10 out of 10. very rare 10 out of 10. i will be eating more of these now that i have so goddamn many and i might give one away so i'll come up with a little contest in the future maybe in the comments below but in the description below i will think of something i'll put it in the description and maybe i'll send one out to one of you viewers so pay attention to the description of this video on how to get one of these alright guys that's been another episode of spike reviews as always please like comment and subscribe hit that

purple minion you stagger them so that when they melt they don't hit each other as for our parents hope for this part because you have to use the oven now my mom is going to go and put these in the oven at 350 degrees for 5 minutes I know I'm just got them out of the oven and they're really hot we just put our stick and like that and twist and then I repeat for the others we have all the steps and now we have to wait 10 minutes for it to cool now we're going to add the eyes what we do is we take one of our eyes and there we take our black gel and raise bit on the back and then we put it on one of our minutes and then we repeat for the others you actually came out where it looks like he's funky hair just like in the movie we gotta check our black Decker Angel and we gonna make it the glasses they're all done in here's what they look like now for the best part the taste test let's try it oh wow that's actually really good we have lemon a blue raspberry it's actually a good combo it's a little sour but overall pretty good actually he's real off on the make and it's a really good if you liked this video if you did give it a big thumbs up we want to subscribe see you later bye", "DGIe1XpRQfI": "hello everyone today we're going to be making kool-aid dolly pops and so this is a recipe that I have made a couple times and I truly like this recipe because it works for me and it's easy to find the ingredients so basically all you need is water cooking spray corn syrup or honey sugar and one pack of kool-aid so I'm just gonna start off by taking my molds and I'm going to spray them with cooking spray just so when I put the lollipop sear up into the molds they don't stick so just like that I'm going to put that to the side now in a on a small saucepan I put half a cup of water in it with 1/3 a cup of corn syrup okay I'm just gonna pour the corn syrup and with the water you always want to make sure the water goes in first well that's what I always do just so I make sure I think sticks to the bottom of the pan okay oh I'm just gonna go put this in the sink okay so now I'm back um and I forgot to mention you're also gonna need some other supplies if you want to wrap it you're gonna need some pops I mean really pop sticks you're gonna need some cellophane bags and some twist ties and you can find the twist ties anywhere it's like you can game at the grocery store and this last thing is a little bit harder to find but you can find it at any craft store it's a candy thermometer and we're going to be needing that and so what I just did was I put I'm 1/3 cup of corn syrup into the water in the pan and I'm also going to add to that one cup of sugar white sugar and so this is a four sided four were these right into the pan so one two three four okay and we are just going to turn that on to high heat and let it boil um and stir it once and every once in a while real quick I just forgot to mention um once it starts to boil you want to turn it down to medium medium heat okay so I let this reach 300 degrees and I'm going to take the kool-aid and I'm going to put it in with the syrup that has been sitting for about five to ten minutes now and you want it to sit because the kool-aid will not be will not flavor it you don't let it sit long enough it'll actually um evacuate evaporate okay so I'm gonna pour these in time old okay everyone so I just poured it into my mold so that is what they look like and I prop them up normally stay up without a paper towel and just to ensure that the sticks are actually into the zero up and that's what I do I pop them up with a paper towel and so I'm gonna share with you some cleaning methods for this because this can be really really messy and it's hard to get up clean so I'm going to fill the pot with water and I'm going to put this on the stove again and this helps the syrup um sort of get into the water um I'm just gonna put that on um heat again so the syrup actually goes into the water and it makes it a lot easier for cleaning um Wow our lowly pops sit okay so I took a pot of water and I'm putting on the stove and I just did this method because it takes about two times for it actually get all of it off and so after you get some of it off the first time just put more water back in it until um it's clean I guess and so I'm gonna go call the cops right here and I'm just going to take out these little things then I put underneath them I'm staying up because at this point your lollipops should be pretty solid um I wouldn't touch them yet because they're still in their hardening stage so this is what it should look like when your water oops when your water is boiling it should be red or whatever color your kool-aid was and that's the sign that the kool-aid is actually wearing off on the from the pan into the water and so in a couple minutes I'm going to take this pot and just going to dump it down the drain and I might have to do this method one or two more times but this is the only way that I've used to get this off so I know it works so I'm just gonna turn the heat off I'm going to go pour this into this thing and at this point or after the next time you boil your water it should be easy enough to scrape off the side and so I'm just gonna let this sit with more water in the pan on the high key again for a minute or so just so we can get the last little bit off of the pan okay so oops sorry for that um I finished cleaning up my pan um now I've made this only times that I have designated a special pot for me to use because some of it doesn't always come out and so so I still have like a little bit of syrup from every time I've made all it helps in it which is fine by me because it was a small pot that we don't use at all and so I'm just going to take my molds at this point this should be hard I'm just going to flip them over and I'm going to gently pop them out and so it shouldn't take too much I hurt to get them out just so this is one of all the props that you know and it's a dragonfly a little son I think so a bumblebee and so my molds are like just molds that I got from joining fabrics and I got them and say oh I think they were like $2 but um they're only like four but you don't need to keep buying new molds if you always clean them and stuff so yeah and I'm gonna show you how to wrap them actually so I usually take these um let me see if I can find it um I can't find the wrapper for it but um there are like little old bags and they're like I think there's so things it's all the thing Thanks but they work really well for my lollipops because they fit really nicely inside them but I think they make different sizes too so you can choose which size fits through all the tops best but basically I just put it in and I wrap up the end just like this and I put it this high round it and I got gold twist ties um this time so that's what it ends up looking like and I think it looks really professional and I'm actually going to start selling these because I've made so many so I'm just gonna show you some my other products that I made and these are my honey lollipops and I'm actually making these for my grandma because she has cancer and her throat is always sore and Scratchy and so the honey actually really helps my mom was sick once um a couple weeks ago and she had a really sore throat and this helps for like in it it helped coat your throat so she could eat right after and it yeah she said it helped for about 30 minutes after you you're done eating it and these are some of my other kool aid lollipops and I made this with the mixed berry which are one of my favorites with and yeah I haven't tried this flavor yet so should be interesting so I'm just gonna finish wrapping these real quick I'm going to be starting a new series and this is gonna be in the new series on my channel and I'm it's gonna be a food channel because I love baking and I love anything to do with baking so I'll be filming all the things I make and all the recipes so you can turn making onto and maybe you like baking as much as I do after you watched on my videos but yeah I'm trying to think well um I will list all oh like the prices of the products down below if I have a chance but I'll mean the right now just so you know the solo fan was about two dollars for a pack of 15 the twist ties were a doll or something for 50m and you want to get the same um same amount of the twist ties and the bags so that way you don't have to twist ties or too many bags and not enough of one of the other um throw a lollipop sticks want tips fun too and I got all my supplies at dry and dry hand fabrics so I'm just going to finish wrapping them and I will show you the finished product this is a finished product of the kool-aid lollipop now I would really like to see if you guys make these lollipops so if you watch this video and if you have an Instagram or Twitter do hashtag cooler the light pops with Maddy and so that way I can see all of your lovely creations with this recipe because you can do so many things with them and yeah so I'm going to try it this is definitely my new favorite", "R1rJ7TicIKQ": "hello and

i'm out peace", "7P9-wsy1ix4": "hi my name is bethany beck and i'm going to be teaching you how to make candy with honey all right let's get started so first who am i my name is bethany beck as i've already covered i am not a beekeeper yet although eventually i would love to i recently graduated at covenant college my passions are plants as you can see behind me bees and the environment i am huge on all three and how did i get the idea to make candy with honey um this is kind of weird i love to cook but i never really tried anything with candy until i started playing a certain game of dnd with my friends um if you're unfamiliar with the game basically you make your own character and then you play that character with your friends you fight villains etcetera etcetera it's all in the imagination and my character that i created she was a beekeeper which was so much fun and one of the things that she did as an act of kindness is everyone she kind of came across she would give a honey lollipop and eventually after playing for this character for about a year i was like you know what i should actually try and make these uh so i looked up some recipes i've researched some and i finally found something that i liked made them and then i brought them to my group and they loved them i brought them to bee club and everyone there loved them and then somehow i'm here and i have an etsy page so um don't like if you want to just buy my lollipops not make them then you're more than welcome to do that uh my edgy page is called bex honeysuckers and yeah it's super great all right so let's get into it what you're going to need as far as tools goes you're going to need a measuring cup tablespoons pot a basting brush molds stick and a candy thermometer if you don't have a mold and you want to try it out for the first time one of the things that you can do is take a flat pan fill it with powdered sugar and then take like a cup and make indents into the powdered sugar and then put your sticks in it kind of works as a mold i haven't tried it myself but i know it works from research but i will say the molds that i use these guys are only 2.99 from hobby lobby and there are every other week they are 30 off so it's pretty easy and they're also reusable so you can use them as many times as you want um and then i do want to specify if you're going to do this you need to use a candy thermometer there are some people that can do it without but it is very difficult to know when it's reached the proper temperature and it is very vital that you take it off the temperature as soon as it hits that so i really suggest using a candy thermometer now the ingredients you're going to need sugar which all of you should have you're going to use some light corn syrup honey and water and then additionally if you want to add flavoring that's totally totally optional all right now here's the recipe i will go ahead and let everyone write it down you can take a picture of the screen it's pretty simple 2 cups of sugar 1 4 cup of water two thirds a cup of light corn syrup and two tablespoons of honey um i videoed this because i've already done that and i just want to get into how to make it once we get there and a lot of people look at how much honey there actually is in this and they're very surprised um and i will say you can make these only using honey but to be honest it's a waste of money because honey is gold and using a lot of honey to do this would be kind of crazy so it is much better especially for the structure and the smoothness if you just go ahead and follow this recipe in addition you can also use different flavorings for the batch that i'm going to be making today with you guys i am doing one tablespoon of honey a few drops of essential oil and a tablespoon a little splash of lavender syrup which i'll get into all right so the directions first you want to prepare your molds do this before you even touch any of the ingredients because if you try and do this later you are going to regret it again i got these at hobby lobby pretty cheap you can also find them on amazon um i like the ones that are flat and circular just because they're really simple and you're going to want to make sure that these sticks are about halfway into where the lollipop will be that just gives it a good structure before you even touch the ingredients again make sure your molds are all prepped up and that you have placed a stick in every single mold because there's nothing worse than pouring your sugar and realizing half of your molds don't have sticks in them and real quick i'm going to go ahead and show you what it looks like um so i have this set up so that the edges are covering each other so that there is no table shown that's a really good trick for not getting your counter super messy um i am going to talk about cleanup a little bit later um but it is just easier not to have the mess to clean up in the beginning um and then you can use pam if you would like to keep the the mold really well greased um it's not necessary though so you know i just kind of avoid it because why why waste that money alrighty so the next step is going to be take all of your ingredients and put them in the pot i've already done this because i wanted to make it easier for us to go ahead and make them and when you do put all the ingredients in you're going to make sure you give it a nice stir because this is going to be the only time you stir i made this mistake several times but it is best once you've got your ingredients in just to let it sit and then you're going to put over medium-high heat i've been doing this for a while so i'm going to go ahead and put it over high heat the medium-high heat just to allow you the time to kind of observe and make sure it doesn't get out of hand and then one thing that you really need to do is take a basting brush and some water and then just go around the rim on the inside and use that water to kind of wipe away any of the sugar that might be on the edges this is incredibly important because the way sugar works if sugar comes in contact with sugar crystals it will start to crystallize um when it gets to the point that you're pouring and it comes in contact with that then you're gonna end up with lollipops that are really rough on the tongue and not very fun to eat so it is best to make sure that you're wiping the edges as you cook it's not gonna affect the sugar or anything it's just gonna make sure that that crystallization doesn't happen alrighty so you're going to make that sit you're going to let that sit until it starts to [Music] thicken and then you're also going to use your candy thermometer and you're just going to add it on the side and i generally mine doesn't stick very well to the pot but i just kind of like to prop it in and just let it sit there alright so you're going to put your candy thermometer in and you're going to keep an eye on the temperature as soon as it hits 300 degrees fahrenheit you have to work quickly so it is very important to keep your eye on that temperature i will say though it will take a little while to get up to 300 degrees fahrenheit alrighty it is getting pretty close to being 300 so i'm going to add a few last things i'm going to add a few drops of lavender essential oil and a few drops of food coloring i'm going to it is hit 300 so i'm going to turn off the heat i'm going to pour it into a separate pan that i used for pouring these which i'll show you in just a second there's this pan it has a lip and then i'm going to submerge it in an ice bath and i'm not going to let it i'm just kind of letting it sit there until it stops bubbling as hard just calming down quite a bit so i'm going to go ahead and wipe the rim and right now i'll go ahead and show you this is how it kind of looks it's purple because i added that food coloring and i apologize for adjusting the camera so much but we have to work quickly because again this waits for no one and you're just going to pour it into each one of the molds and as you see as i'm pouring it is quite bubbly it will lose some of those bubbles once it's cooling um but some of them actually do stay and it kind of looks pretty cute so i don't mind it and optional you could add things like glitter um or like gold leaf or you know any like dried flowers some people do that you prep your molds in the first place you can just place it on the bottom below the stick so that when you pour it in it's going to look really good and it won't mess with it you can also add toppings on top of it but because this is such a time sensitive thing most of the time by the time you're finished pouring and you get back to putting toppings on those first lollipops they're already hardened so i don't recommend doing that i'm glad i added that food coloring so you guys can see how it looks alrighty so once you saw once it hit 300 degrees fahrenheit it is fast and quick work um there is not much time to kind of talk about the directions so i'm going to do that now again once it hits 300 you're going to remove it from the heat and you're going to submerge it in an ice bath the point of that is to make sure it does not go any higher than 300 degrees fahrenheit once it does it starts to become caramel and you can't really work with it and then you're just going to leave it in there to the point where the bubbles have really calmed down and it stopped boiling then you're going to pour each lollipop as carefully as you can try not to get things to spill really give each mold your your undivided attention because it is very easy to have a lapse of judgment and overfill or spill it's not a big deal but it's just you know it's a waste of that wonderful candy um and then you're gonna let them sit for about five minutes to cool um and then once they're finished cooling you can wrap or enjoy them right there um so yeah it's pretty simple straightforward um again i would not do this with kids because it is very dangerous working with hot candy but it's still pretty fun so kids could watch i just wouldn't suggest them doing this part of the they can mix the ingredients that would probably be the only thing i'd let them do all right now we're going to talk about additional flavorings um as you saw i do have this infused syrup that i use i made it using lavender this is food grade that i ordered online so i know it's really good and pure and i can send that recipe to anyone that wants it if you just shoot me an email i will have my email at the end and then you can also use things like essential oils as far as this goes i really really suggest you only use one or two drops i think i accidentally used four in this batch but i would say that's probably too strong because essential oil is good in very small amounts when it comes to food but if you do too much it is not good for your health so please make sure you only use small portions of that and then you can also do flavoring and coloring um when you are buying these make sure that they are only meant for food um again with like essential oils it might be tempting to use the cheap stuff that you can find on the shelf of any store but really make sure that you're getting it from a good place that it knows it's for food i'm not sure what the health risks are there but i i wouldn't want to mess with them i use lori anna oils lauren's makes food coloring they make all oils they make flavorings and they they make a lot of stuff specifically for candy making so that is a really good source um and then if you do end up using food coloring make sure that you use a water-based food coloring not a gel because that's not going to work as well in a mixture like this alright then i wanted to also give you guys a little instruction about reusable wraps so one thing that i like to do just as a fun little additive is wrap my lollipops in these beeswax wraps just kind of adds another layer to the fun so your supplies for this you are going to need fabric cut into five by five inch squares that's just what i found has worked for me you're gonna need a hanger with a tiny clothespin you could probably use normal size but i use tiny so you are going to need a pan that you don't use for cooking i got this at goodwill for super cheap and it works really well especially because it has this really thick bottom so it retains that heat really well and then you're going to use some really good high quality wax shout out to harold lanier because this wax is gold it's amazing all right i'm going to go ahead and readjust and then we'll make these real quick so for this we're only going to use a very low heat again because my pan has a really thick bottom it's going to retain that heat so i'm not going to have to do i might even cut off the heat while i'm doing this just because it doesn't need it you are going to let it warm up so you're just going to melt a little bit of that wax and set that aside for later and you're going to take your fabric and just drape it into the wax let it soak it up again you only want a very thin coat of the wax you don't want it to be super thick i'll show you why in just a minute once it has absorbed all of the wax you're going to turn off your heat and this is the part where normally i have my hanger hanging on something and i just pin it to the clothespin um but i don't have anything to hang it on so i'm just going to hold it and i'm going to go ahead and tell you why you don't want to do a super thick coat of this wax so i have found that if you do a really thick coat of wax it makes this very like crinkly and the wax will come off whereas thinner coats are way more durable which you wouldn't think but that's how it is and easier to use and wash all right so it is already done it's not quite fully dry but it's dry enough that i can set it aside and i'll go ahead and show you two how i wrap them all right so now i'm going to show you how to wrap these in the reusable wraps we just made so this is the lollipop i just made it is gorgeous i might have taken it out a little bit too early because you might can tell it's a little warpy but that's okay it for now that's fine all right so you're gonna take your wrap and you're gonna center the lollipop right in the middle so it's gonna look like that then you're gonna take the other end and fold it over the lollipop and kind of squish the side down so it molds and then you're going to take the corner fold it downwards so it's going to look like that and then fold the bottom corner upwards so it's going to look like that all right and then what you're going to do is do the exact same thing but for the opposite side so again i'm bending it downwards like that and then bending it upwards like that all right now it still looks a little wonky but this is the fun part you're just going to twist it and then the way the wax works is it molds together and you can reshape that as you need and it looks gorgeous so that's the main purpose that i use the wax wraps for all righty and i'm just going to say this real quick if you do end up making these make sure that you only ever wash them with cold water and a mild soap and make sure that whoever you do give them to knows that because if you wash it with warm water the wax is going to go away all right so these are examples of some of the things that i use these wraps for they are quite small so honestly there's not a whole lot that you can use them for but you can use them for just preserving produce for covering up mugs but the main thing i use them for these lollipops all right now before i end my presentation i do want to go over how to clean up because this is a very messy task your best friend when cleaning up is going to be hot water and soap helps as well but hot water is the key here when you've got your pan that still has a pretty thick coating of that sugar on the bottom because it is going to solidify while you're pouring go ahead just add fresh water to that and then you're going to put it on high heat and you're going to add just a few dollops of soap and now you're just going to let it sit you're going to let that sit for i would probably do a good 20 minutes it takes a long time for that sugar to kind of dilute in the water that you're boiling so definitely just sit let that sit and forget about it once it's finished boiling and you've kind of can tell that all the sugar has reincorporated all you have to do is pour it down the sink it has saved so much time to do it this way and it's fantastic um same with cleaning your molds you are just going to use hot water and soap there shouldn't be too much of a cleanup as far as the molds go because i'll pull one over here you can see where i spilled a lot it just breaks off so as far as cleaning that goes you mostly just have to break off the sugar and then if you have any spots that you spilled on the counter or on the eye of the stove it is a little bit more tricky to clean that up again boiling water is your best friend here so make sure that you have boiling water and then i usually use a rag and some soap but again boiling water is the key and yeah it's pretty easy to clean up if you just kind of let it sit for as long as you can um it's not that difficult and because i use two pots there's a little bit more cleanup but it's not too bad all righty thank you so much for joining me and learning how to make these suckers i hope that you try it out and enjoy them i am so

one's called grab pop and looking at this box it looks like we got grape strawberry and green apple flavor these candy toys are always fun so I can't wait to play with them you let me take off this plastic wrapper move this to the back right here all right one two three four five six we have two rows of six so that makes 12 grab pops here's a closer look at the green and yellow grab pop I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this is green apple let's see what happens when we press this green button Oh while it extends to club pinches it's like a jab claw here's a different color this one's pink and purple this flavor could either be great or strawberry we'll have to check out the other clocks if I down these things are so cool hey guys look I have claw hands now don't make me pinch you our last color is blue and purple I think this one's the great one and the other one strawberry hmm I wonder if it's easy to pick things up with this we'll have to try it out later let's see if I guess my flavors right there's a plastic that's wrapped around the middle here but I think we could just pull it out you gotta use a little force there we go now let me just peel this wrapper off I got one right this is green apple if you can't finish the lollipop in one setting you can just put the cap back on and you can always grab something too I was a little confused at first but let's see what this labor is I guess strawberry nice I'm two for two I forgot to mention earlier but these tastes really good put the cap back on for this one claw jab so it looks like this one's the grape one YUM I've that too many lollipops already I'll save this for later you guys ready to test out these claws let's give around the club floss for our volunteers get it hey juicy orange oops sorry yes I grabbed Twilight Sparkle easily put you back down but oh don't worry i'll pick you back up these things are actually hard to use you can't really grab them nah behind Ali oh nice I got all up in one go let's see if I can grab them quickly nope whoa skeleton guy dodge my claw jab I'm barely holding him by the arm okay I could do this that was a bit too strong sorry cheesy whoa that was a nice grab
