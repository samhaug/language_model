lot of people already noticed my people don't right but how do you check if there's or do you fight over it more and more like how to find holes in your blood one Army's in common way is looking for them right oh no when you can't really find it you and I would have [ __ ] the whole that right that would have flipped the whole let you trying to steal their something fix it right you can't find it all right well let me tell you something senator keep low key looks better all right so you blowing it and eventually you know fire every time I say fire with my man much I myself foot when I was little that's right when I was little those little toys that you buy and they say fire fire do this we just sold dance I want to say it's about two grams in here I almost forgot to review the week all right guys look so this right here has a beautiful smell oh it's strong the smell is strong man the bud is frosty oh man so yeah I've seen that already but let me just show you I wish I could see if my taste my but my taste buds there you go are like whack I know when a weed hits like a certain way like the south or just the flavor that leaves behind this one it could either be the Duchess I smoke because I tried a new Java champ not the new ones this is new to me because I already smoked those and I mean it kind of let the good taste and on the rap like really the bread left a good taste but the we good taste like what I hate it right now it tastes a little strong but anything bad but anything good you know mmm this is a I did make a little research I'm like I'm gonna tell y'all I know this for a fact I just this is just on top of my head I remember eyeful reading this I always leave it the information are pletely in the description so go read that go read that like it see it's all India if you need more information it's all in there but um it's like a sativa dominant obviously it's a hybrid it's a cheap Adame good for like you know getting chilled out relaxed but also as a day time we do you know isn't a time strain you can take it day time anyone like have you knocked out and [ __ ] but you don't have your relaxed relaxed you'll be chilly damn we taught minutes in and we all looked over but it usually takes me about 30 minutes about to take 16 I say all these time but the times don't really stay on the video because you know it gets edited it gets cut out 7-eleven should like let me do it out for them or not bad but I sponsor me I'll be like go to 7-eleven and get your new hot chocolate median size for just $1.99 I think it's probably I'm already [ __ ] them I can't do it easily but I'll be like welcome to the new cafe where you can smoke weed and drink your latte no I mean like I actually do ads for their life with this mask on [Music] from one to ten how high do you think I am look you started your pout lovely there you go definitely how high but my reasonable bees we don't smooth the whole thing that is blue dream let me talk about the effects the low kill forget about well let me tell you how it feels to be honest the highest so pan instead the way that I cubed is like I feel the hair change I know I'm highest but I'm faded issue I can feel them higher [ __ ] the citizens it's so balanced it's just like it feels normal you know but your mood is definitely so like chill down as you can't see but you know you can stay focused on what

to Dutchman's medical marijuana Channel today I'm going to show you guys where that was a couple things we have Holy Grail in week 10 finishing up here nice beautiful buds looking nice and pretty today he says ones yelling up real nice she's getting pushed out on her second week of flushing so she's getting real close to being ready to pull out they take her down tomorrow and that one over there will be next actually they'll pop you first then this one I kind of wait to my leaves yellow up nicely then I pull them down that way I know my plants flushed through the entire plant not just the root system or the pot and what I really want to show you today is the beautiful blue dream haze this beautiful girl right here is gonna be my keeper I can tell already she just smells absolutely phenomenal got that nice creamy blueberry haze smell and the other five just don't have it so I end up popping five seeds and that back there's another beautiful one massive colas in that sucker I think that's gonna be my best yielding one but this is my best tasting one we got a couple right there things looking beautiful they've been all States moved all the clasp up and we are starting week six just so you guys know week six and we are under thousand watt double-ended bulbs with the king wing hoods and lr5 light rail system I have 6,000 watts here down from 10,000 so I took my ten thousand I'm out room put the lr5 light rail in and cut my legging back and I'm down to six thousand watts and I can put about 35 to 40 plants under this setup and that keeps me under my limit and everything staged beautifully about two to four weeks apart so they only got about three to six plants getting done every month and just keep spacing them out keep them going perpetual so that's about it I just want to kind of show you guys the blue dream haze how she's coming along looking absolutely phenomenal our next video will be on the tangerine Dream's which don't really know if I have any favourites on these ones yet I usually wait till about week six to start phenotyping for smell and stickiness and kind of get a better idea of which one I'm leaning towards so that's it that wraps up our video we are in week ten of Holy Grail and week six of blue dream haze thank you much hope you enjoyed our video talk to you guys later peace Oh", "kxPDtpbK-Q8": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the duke grows on today's episode i'm super excited to show my first run and my 4x8 tent in my new house so everything that you guys might have seen in the past was at my old house and in this house i decided i'm going to do four by eight tents everywhere and i have some other size tents as well but this is all from clone all basically i'm going to show you from the cloning process all the way to the final yield so yeah hang out and let's take a look so i wanted to show you before we get started kind of what i'm doing here with the setup i have my fans i have uh the intake fans the outtake fans the carbon filter i have a spider farmer 4000 light on one side and an hlg v2r spec light on the other side so yeah it's pretty nice everything is nice and clean right now on my first run um you see there that little intake fan with a little cloth kind of over it i don't really feel like i need a carbon filter fan going in but i do want some kind of little covering so stuff doesn't really get in too much but yeah that's uh pretty much the setup for this tent for this run i was taking a bunch of clones off of this blue dream hybrid plant it's called blue hash or blue hatcheson it really is similar to a blue dream so i've been really happy with the results on this in the past if you guys have seen a handful of my videos you've probably seen this strain pop in and out but yeah i had this uh this mother that needed a bunch of defoliation anyway so i took a bunch of clones from this um the real way to just do clones if anybody wants to see how to do cloning i am not an expert at this honestly i failed this way too often but basically try to get like four nodes down and then do like a 45 degree angle cut and then put them into these rock wool cubes you can also also put them into a root hormone first which i uh do and then put those into those rock ball cubes and after about seven to fourteen days you'll see roots starting to pop out of these things they won't do anything for like a week to 10 days and then you'll start seeing the roots just start exploding out of them and from the rockwool cubes i just put them right into a solo cup once they start rooting i should say then i put them right into a solo cup and let them veg for a little bit before i transplant into a final five gallon [Music] pot [Music] from here really all i'm doing is just watering i'm using this little two gallon hand pump sprayer thing which is pretty pretty soft so it doesn't like disturb the plants too much well yeah they they really do like a lot of water with if you transplant with a heavy root structure already they really kind of transpire quite a bit so you can soak them pretty good and uh it's definitely important to keep the humidity pretty high i like to use a humidity dome to make sure the humidity stays like 80 90 percent and then yeah i mean keep them keep them wet keep them uh water them every day if you can every two days is probably fine if you if you have the humidity high enough yeah they'll start exploding [Music] so from here i just let them veg out for a little while in the solo cups i could have transplanted them into the final five gallon pots a little earlier but i just didn't i mean they got in there pretty quick anyway but um after that i just ended up topping them all when they kind of have about five or six nodes i would top them and that will let them bush out a little bit more if you want to learn more about topping there's other videos out there for i think i have one on that as well but uh yeah it's pretty simple stuff that's about all i really did for these things and then yeah letting them go from there [Music] as far as watering goes i would do water on monday with nutrients i'd water with nutrients on wednesday and i would only give it water on friday and then i wouldn't water again until the next monday so basically three days a week i would water i think i didn't ever really super soak the medium either i think that's a different way of going about it you could maybe water just monday and just friday give it like three days four days rest between but i didn't really really soak the medium i just kind of gave it about you know one pitcher of water about a half gallon of water on each of those days and sometimes on friday when it was just water i might give them like a pitcher and a half [Music] the nutrients that i used for this whole run were the general hydroponics three-part series i would uh just take these nutrients put it right into my five gallon bucket fill it with water and then hand water i ended up doing something a little different after that but i'll show you that later on in the video that being said this is actually the last time i'm going to be using general hydroponics i have not just not been happy with the bud density when it's all said and done and so i have been using nuke heads which uh they sent me some stuff for free a long time ago and i've actually really liked it so um the bud density that i used in the white widow uh was all nuke heads and that was like twice as dense as anything that i've gotten with the general hydroponics stuff so i'm going to be switching over entirely to nuke heads in my future grows however this one i wanted to use just general hydroponics and i have another 4x8 right behind this one which i'm using only new cut so i'm really excited for the side by side when it comes to that [Music] well we're cruising right along here and this tent is just getting filled out like crazy and i'm like i knew that i was probably going to be over planting a little bit in this tent but it's getting pretty pretty jungly in here so i did a big defoliation before flipping over into flour and i knew even after flipping them into flour this tent is going to be absolutely packed so you know i wasn't that sad about it i'm like i think it will be fine i'm just gonna have to really fight things like high humidity and mold and stay on top of my defoliation and maybe if i really pack out a tent like this i'm actually gonna have better results you know more plants more more yield that's not necessarily going to be the case though and uh you'll see why as this continues on it was really helpful though to defoliate every plant before flipping them into flower i give them pretty much a haircut at least a third of the way up the plant like pretty much choose the line everything below that gone so all that stuff doesn't really get enough light anyway and you're not gonna really gonna ever ever have anything that produces decently down there so that's the first thing i did before flip them into flower and as of this point they were looking pretty good [Music] from then i'm still just watering my normal schedule i put up this trellis net uh i knew these things now that they're in flowering are going to be growing right up into these nets into the lights so when you go into flowering from veg you can expect the plants to at least double in size sometimes triple in size as far as growing up growing height i also ran this uh exhale co2 bag try to increase the co2 levels in this tent not sure if it helped a lot or not but i know having higher co2 which it definitely did did have uh should increase your plant growth so yeah i'm going to continue doing that in the future too [Music] and from here they're just filling out like crazy you know you defoliate one week and the next week they just looks like he didn't do anything to him so i didn't defoliate here for a little while right now they're just growing up and up into these trellis nets they're not quite there yet but they're really close and uh yeah they're stretching out [Music] and in just three days they've stretched right up into it so pretty excited about this every time basically they start growing up and through the trellis net i just bend them over somewhere else put them through a different trellis net hole that's that's i'm going to do that as much as possible to try to maintain an even canopy well they're getting wild and at this point i'm like all right i think there's just so much foliage in here i gotta give it another good trim job so ended up taking all these plants out trimmed up a bunch of the undercarriage some more took a bunch of fan leaves off the top as well and uh yeah just trying to trying to fight the canopy to make sure that i give as much possible light coverage to all the bud sites that i can i'm always looking for ways to optimize things do things a little easier too so i ended up getting this like uh sump pump a little submersible pump and a 50 foot hose and a garden sprayer and i fill up this uh 20 gallon tub add my nutrients to it and then i just run the submersible pump right to my garden hose and then i can basically water all my tents with one hose and it's also an extended arm so i can like don't have to get way deep into the back of the plants and all that stuff you don't just reach back there and do it so that thing has been absolutely awesome like watering is one of the pain in the butts when it comes to this kind of stuff and something like this is just super easy i know i've talked before about like auto watering solutions which i'm not currently using i still think they're great and they have their uses but just with my setup i'm actually hand watering everything now but i made a lot easier on myself than filling five gallon buckets and hand watering everything just with a pot too so yeah i think that's a great solution if it's something that you guys struggle [Music] with for now just watching everything grow keeping uh things tucked in trying to keep the canopy as even as possible some of the plants are just growing a lot more than others there are a couple other plants in here outside of the blue blue dream so those are actually growing a little bit differently which i was i mean yeah it's something you gotta expect i guess but yeah tucking and tucking and super [Music] cropping [Music] you can really start seeing these flowers pack on quick though i was uh at this point in the grow i was like man i think this is going to be absolute fire it's like just blowing up and not much time at all so if they kept putting on weight like this i was like this is going to be a record harvest and um yeah we're super happy with what's what's going on [Music] also if you guys have watched a handful of these videos love it if you subscribe you can see a lot of these kind of videos coming up if this is the kind of stuff you like i'll be having a bunch more of these type of videos four by four auto runs two by four a three by three ten it's all coming up in the next month so yeah hit subscribe and uh you'll hit you'll see uh some more videos like this coming out soon and if you want to support me in any way any of the amazon affiliate links down below if you ever buy anything from amazon click one of those links first and uh it gives me a little kickback so it's always appreciated but a like and a comment is more than i could ever ask for definitely like you guys uh sticking with me and appreciate you a lot of people have asked how far away should you keep the light there's so many factors to that but the light itself is probably really dependent on it for these i try to not go closer than like 18 inches a lot of times some of the top buds that are growing up might be within a foot though so as long as they don't get light burned these things have been within six inches of these lights and get very minor light burn at most so yeah i don't know 18 inches a foot is about what i usually run [Music] well here's where start things start to get a little bit more interesting like not bad not great just something so i was leaving for a week in the middle of this grow didn't really know exactly what i was going to do i i had a buddy that was going to come over and water it but i was like hell maybe i can actually just really soak them and so i'm not too worried about that but then i was having high humidity issues this this tent was getting like 80 90 humidity at some points after watering and so i was like man this thing is just so full i'm not so sure that i can i trust i don't want to i don't want to leave these for seven days and come back to a big bold fest you know with high humidity in there and so i talked to a local hydroponic store owner who i'd get a bunch of my stuff through and uh he's super smart when it comes to growing and he's like dude just chop all the top butts right now like if the top buds are looking great and they're like only a week away from harvest anyway maybe two weeks harvest them a little early you won't be sad about it you're still gonna have some great big buds and then let the all the uh lower stuff finish up on its own after that and it's like that's genius i'll definitely do that so what i ended up doing was actually harvesting all of my top buds and i left everything else below that so this is what it looked like right before harvesting all the top buds they looked done to me i mean they were only about eight weeks maybe just over eight weeks some were right right then um but they looked finished they had like nice colors already coming through i didn't give them to two days of like darkness before i only gave them just a night before of darkness so that could have played a factor as well in how they finish up but they were still super frosty they looked really good and i'm just going to let the other lower stuff finish out from here and in about two more weeks i'll harvest all this well here's a lot of the top buds that i ended up taking and then um here is the rest of the plants after they got topped so let those things roll and hopefully all that lower stuff ends up getting a lot more light ends up dense enough a good bit more because that light lower stuff was not even worth touching at this point so definitely needed to give it some more time [Music] [Music] so i ended up having all this stuff dry uh while i was away i put it in this dry drying rack and i was going the next week and had this this drying for the week that i was gone so i felt pretty good about that and came back and yeah started trimming i did hand trim all of the top buds uh i was live streaming for man probably three or four days i was when i was pretty much hand trimming i would just go live and uh a lot of you guys would hop in and talk to me so that's really fun and um yeah i plan on doing that more i don't want to do more than just trimming but it's definitely easy to talk to you guys well there's only 15 15 people in there maybe um yeah it's a lot of fun so if you aren't subscribed subscribe so you can see when i go live if you ever want to chat i love doing that [Music] well back onto this lower stuff i'm really hoping these small buds start to take shape a little bit better and and really uh firm up so i think they're okay they're definitely very light and larfy so i'm not sure how much better they're gonna get because they have been shaded out a lot of this stuff has been shaded out not all of it there's still some pretty good sized buds on here but a lot of lower stuff i'm just hoping will turn into something usable but we'll see [Music] you can really see these fall colors starting to come through like crazy i have been giving them only water since probably week seven so yeah their nutrients are all used up and they're starting to just cannibalize themselves and uh yeah all these fall colors are looking really pretty [Music] well i actually really debated even telling you guys this i always try to be honest with everybody so i'm going to and there's going to be so many that hate me for it but i plan on doing a lot of production so this is a one-man operation this is just me and i needed to figure out some solution for trimming so i ended up getting this i i can remember what it's called some trimmer bowl um i will find it and i'll put it in the description below but i could do about five or six ounces an hour with this auto trimmer compared to maybe an ounce an hour to doing hand trimming and with all this little the larfey little buds and the um just small denser buds doing a wet trim with this thing it saves so much time did i get as good of a product as hand trimming no i don't think i did at all but if i'm doing i mean i can't be spending 40 hours every every week i'm just trimming either so anyway this is what i did for good or bad i actually don't think i'm going to use this again because it seemed to destroy a lot of the very small micro buds that being said i have some really high quality trim which i'm gonna use and maybe turn into bubble hash or just turn into oil and stuff like that so it's not like all is lost but uh i think the final yield actually did get kind of hit because a lot of the smaller buds just kind of got ate by this trimmer either way it is what it is a lot of people have been telling me i need to get this trim bag a a real-life friend of mine uses it and he swears by it and then i've had other you guys talk to me about the trim bag as well it's like 400 bucks for a piece of fabric you know whatever it's fine if it works it's worth the price but uh yeah i'm probably gonna give that a shot once i uh can afford it so yeah i'll i'll keep you up to date if i use some other kind of trimming method if you guys have any other way of trimming that might be cool and helpful and save time and not uh not ruin the bud love to hear from you guys as well [Music] all right so now to the good stuff for the people that skipped all the grow video because you just want to watch cool bud that's all finished here you go so ended up german all this stuff i have it kind of separated into my first batch of hand trimmed top buds and then all my other stuff which is drying in the rack from the auto trimmer [Music] did end up getting some really nice dried buds even off of the lower stuff so i didn't get all the biggest buds i just got the top bud so some of the smaller plants still had some really nice colas from the lower branches so yeah some of these looked really great as you can see here have my setup going and uh yeah just weighing everything up [Music] so when it's all said and done i had 13 ounces from the top buds so i have that all on the right side here and then on the left side i have all the smaller lower branch buds which were also right about 13 ounces so i got about half from the top and half from the bottom my um grams of total grams were 708 grams of dried bud and in trim a lot of that is pretty high quality trim i got a little over 850 grams of trim so gonna be doing a lot of stuff with that 700 and whatever grams of uh bud for this this size tent with this many watts is a bit of a disappointment i was hoping for about two pounds ended up getting just over one and a half and uh i mean my goal was really three pounds for this tent that being said it is what it is i am not going to be using those nutrients anymore i'm going to different nutrients i have the same plants going in a new 4x8 tent uh they are pretty much they're close to done two weeks probably they'll be getting harvested and i gave them a lot more space so they're taller they're fatter they're wider but there's also a lot more light penetration that gets all the way down and so it'll be a nice comparison to see like less plants in the same space just given more room to breathe is the like inner nodal difference something that makes a big difference because if they don't get enough light they're gonna be basically buds more spread out so you know it's all it's all process it's all just learning so i learned something i think maybe i don't know hopefully you guys did if not hopefully you enjoyed it yeah i think that is about it for now i do have a bunch of stuff coming up i am going to be talking a little bit more about my little three plant autoflower grow with the mars hydro ts 3000 and um i have my giveaway which is next week on the giveaway video i think is my last video if you guys haven't done that sign up for a free light there's kind of going to be a neat little twist to that too so uh yes i know just all you have to do is comment on that video on that 3x3 video so look at my last video and uh throw a comment up on there and we're gonna have something fun with that next week yeah i think that's it for now oh yeah and then i have a three by three granddaddy purple four plant tent that's almost done too so yeah there's there's all sorts of stuff coming up anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed it till the next time you guys take care [Music]", "f16zgvvG2Jg": "this is a quick video for week 9 of my blue dream haze grow mostly ten gallon pots except for one of them those are seven gallon if I ran out tens on do a quick phenotype review so if I can remember which string is which when I cut this down and start testing things later and drying it out number one is my favorite smelling one yeah that really nice stretch has the best smell I'm guessing the best flavor as well only problem is the stretch which is good and bad good because it could be a royal ice plant but bad because it didn't fill in all the way there's about one to two inch or more spacing from node to node I don't like that about this plant now it's possible I could shorten it up some but still you'll see what I mean by it just didn't fill in right so we'll never compete against these other ones here in a minute my show you show myself ah so that's number one female here is probably the largest building Fino if not second largest this only could be tied with the other one and this one is number I think it's two yeah number two it's right number one number two those is number two now number two it's got massive friggin Cola runs all the way down that stop there some of these other ones are really huge he's got massive colas nice like nice killing plant and it's got some calyx seen in Week nine which number one has no calyx II now the smell on this one is kind of stinky er it's me it's like a more sour smell it's not nearly a sweet like savory smelling as number one so I'm not really a big fan of number two when it comes to smell but for yield this plant is freakin insane just absolutely insane you know I hear you see what the potency turns out to be in this plant all right now we're gonna move over to number three number three also didn't calyx up as much yielded phenomenal very symmetrical like its counterpart number two it will yield about as much as number two it's there to be really close nice colas I mean everything about I really like except for remember the smell now this one since it didn't calyx up kind of reminds me a little bit more of the smell of number one however the thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have nearly as much of the smell to it as number one does so that it doesn't have that real beautiful haze or blueberry type smell to it that's why I didn't like about that one so phenomenal yo they're beautiful plant possible keeper just like it's number two counterpart but for smell and a kind of sewer no and then here we have our last two numbers females number four and five and I don't like about this Louis is number five I believe let's just confirm yes number five now this was the second smallest plant I put in if you consider size to bud ratio this plant is freaking insane I mean this will be the heaviest yielding plant for sure for its size I mean just absolutely incredible I mean that butt is about as big the top buds both both the main two colors are about the same size as the cola size on the big plan over there sorry this plant will had a chance to really explode and get bigger and grow before I put her in she might even out yielded those ones so this would be a nice plant to keep an eye on however again doesn't really have that great smell it's more of a lemony sour or type smell to it its calyx and up nice again which means it's putting on more size and need to be pulled as well but putting on some more size and then last one is number four that's more of a straight-up corn stalk Christmas tree design grow plant it was the smallest one and didn't really get much time to branch out and do much and again that sour smell so definitely not gonna be a keeper so pretty much right now they're gonna be number one because of smell and flavor and decent yield and sacrifice the meal for some phenomenal taste or to go after yield and not be so concerned about taste and we see what potency is instead so that will cover my quick video to myself about my Pinot's", "EvJ1pswvHMo": "all right

Welcome to Life Noggin! Oh there's a fog rolling in! Wait a minute! [Blocko Sniffs] That's not fog! People have been using cannabis as a sleep\naid for decades, mainly due to the feeling of relaxation and calm it\u2019s commonly associated\nwith. And many believe that it can even help with\nsleep disorders. Studies evaluating the effect of cannabis\non sleep go back to the 70\u2019s, but, because marijuana use has been illegal in the United\nStates since the 30s, research in this field has been largely restricted, and we are still\nlacking verifiable evidence of its effects on health. But scientists have been studying its main\nchemical components for the treatment of many medical issues, like the nausea caused by\ncancer treatments, seizures in children, pain and different sleep disorders. Before we get into how it affects your sleep,\nwe should probably talk about how it all works. What we call weed, pot, or marijuana is actually\na mixture of the dried flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant. It can be smoked, vaped, brewed in teas, made\ninto foods, or concentrated into resins and oils. No matter how you take it, the chemicals in\nthe plant will make their way into your bloodstream, travel throughout your body, and end up in\nyour brain. How fast you feel the effects and how strong\nthey are depends on the method of ingestion. And your experiences can range from relaxation\nand euphoria, to anxiety, fear and panic depending on how much you take and the potency\nof the drug\u2019s active chemicals., Some who have taken large doses have even experienced\na temporary psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. So it\u2019s really, really important to be careful\nwith how much you\u2019re taking and how. And cannabis use has been associated with\nharmful side effects on brain development and the lungs, and can even result in addiction. The main chemical in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n- but you can call it THC. THC is a psychoactive chemical, which means\nthat it can alter your mind. It does this by attaching to neurons in your\nbrain and activating them. This disrupts normal mental and physical functions,\ncausing the sensations typically associated a \u201chigh\u201d. Cannabis also contains another chemical that\nis not psychoactive, called cannabidiol, or CBD. Older studies looking at the effect of the\nwhole cannabis plant on sleep had mixed findings, with some indicating that it can help you\nfall asleep faster and stay asleep, and others showing it can decrease REM sleep,, - which\nis thought to be involved with storing memories, learning, and regulating your mood. More recent studies focus on these major chemicals\nin cannabis, THC and CBD. They found that THC may only have a short-term\nbenefit, with continuous use causing a habit or dependency, as withdrawal from the drug\ncan cause difficulties sleeping.,, Studies also found that THC caused daytime\nsleepiness and bad moods, increased the time to fall asleep, and reduced the body\u2019s circadian\nrhythm - which is needed to regulate your sleep/wake cycle. However, medicines made from it could help\nwith certain sleep disorders like nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder\nand obstructive sleep apnea. It\u2019s clear that more research needs to be\ndone before any definitive conclusions can be made. But, until then, it may be better to stick\nto natural sleep methods like avoiding caffeine, exercising, and keeping a regular sleep schedule.", "U1zq4T7MEWw": ">> Good morning, Mr. Smith--\nmy name is Tammy.

of you on the blue dream so without much further ado let's just get right into it here's some dope shots of the nugs we can get to smoke in this joint so blue Dreams is sativa dominant hybrid coming out of California and it's definitely one of those like legendary West Coast strains everybody's heard of it essentially the genetics are a blueberry plant with a Hays plant and it really gives you like a full kind of relaxed feeling and not too heavy the smokes a little harsh not as smooth as some of the other leaves up reviewed but it's got a real good taste to it just the right amount of bite and the taste on the exhale is actually quite excellent it tastes a lot more like the blueberry plant smell definitely reflects the haze plant this meat is one for you guys out there who don't like those mind rape indicas you know who you are this is gonna be a good potent strain if you're into the sativa is you but it's gonna be an active high you're gonna be able to go around and do [ __ ] after this variety that I picked up is definitely one of the more indica heavy phenotypes just from the way that the buds are grown into sort of like a thick sticky column so the flavor profile on this weed is very very heavy and tastes and smells very sweet even once it's lit doesn't really have that cush smell that a lot of people find mandatory in their weed but personally I find it to be quite quite a nice break from the constant indica you know purple death bucker or whatever the hell you know these crazy strains are called essentially this weed is is it's a good daytime smoke I say that a lot about various weeds and I think this one really sets the bar at a new level because the blue dream is a an especially tasty smoke that's not gonna get you fry mind you I am still feeling pretty good off of this little joint I feel very settled in calm relaxed happy yeah I mean the blue dream itself the weed is great the flower is just there just perfect but another great thing about this weed is the way that it looks while it's growing it's actually a beautiful beautiful plant so if you are gonna grow some blue dream you should know that it tends to grow pretty tall and it tends to have a pretty high yield although it's a moderately difficult strain to grow because I believe it's kind of susceptible to lots of pests and things plus it stretches while it's flowering so there's a couple of things you should know before you go and try to grow the blue dream but if you do get a chance to smoke the blue dream I highly recommend it you should definitely pick up a big bag if you can anyways I think that's it for me on the stringer view of the Blue Dream thanks for watching guys don't forget to like if you like what you see comment if you have something to say send it to your friends share it on your Facebook each of vegetables all that good [ __ ] and and yeah peace out guys thanks for watching", "dHcbmIAOl44": "going on everybody Connecticut medical marijuana critic here

another Terpene Profile Breakdown Video. As usual I am joined by my Chief Lab Tech; Professor Matsumoto (What's up), my Media Director; Audrey (Hi), and we are here to do one of the most popular strains in\nthe world: Blue Dream. Blue Dream terpene profile that\nwe've created. Now if you don't know what Blue Dream is, I need you to turn off\nyour computer or your cell phone, and question why you're in the cannabis industry, maybe come back five years from now. Blue Dream is probably the most popular\ncannabis strain on the planet, whether you like it or not. It's controversial,\nsome people like it, some people don't, but it is what it is. Parent lineage is Blueberry mixed with Haze. And it is by far our most popular\nselling terpene profile, it is very good. If you are just starting out and you\nneed somewhere to go, that isn't gonna be a problem, and you need a good product;\nBlue Dream's gonna make it. We really nailed this one, why they considered it to be our best profile. You'll notice right off the bat that the bottle, right here in\nthe center, is clear. That's because this is in our organic line of terpenes. It is\npure organic terpenes, there's nothing artificial, nothing synthetic, terpene\nonly blend. First thing you're gonna do when you're in the store or you buy it,\nthinking of buying it, you're gonna smell it. So let me tell you what it smells\nlike. Smells like a mild earthy cannabis. There's no distinct flavors in it that are different from one another. It just\nsmells like good weed, quite simply. One of the things that I tell everyone in\nevery single video, because it is of the utmost importance; is you should never\nbuy your terpenes based on what the bottle smells like. That is a rookie\nmistake, don't be a terp rookie. I will explain it so you understand it. I explain it\nalways because it is so important. Terpene profiles like this are created\nfrom about 20 different terpenes. Now every liquid in life has an evaporation\npoint. These being liquids, all the different terpenes evaporate out at\ndifferent temperatures, at different rates. When you smell a bottle, you're\nsmelling it at room temperature. You're smelling the few terpenes that evaporate\noff at whatever rate they do at room temperature. That is gonna combine\ntogether and form one type of a smell. That's not the way we make these\nproducts. We make these products so that all of those terpenes evaporate out at\nthe temperature inside of a vapor pen, to create the flavor that we've done. It is\nanother level of engineering that most companies don't do. That's why our\nproducts are scientifically better. I'm gonna let Audrey explain that a little\nbit better to you, or in more detail. Right, so the most important thing to keep in\nmind when you are getting into terpenes, buying terpenes, learning about them in\ngeneral, is that that pen almost never tastes exactly like what the bottle\nsmells like. You need to know this because at the end of the day your\nclients are going to be tasting that pen, not smelling the bottle you have. That's what makes our products so much better. We've spent hours formulating these for the\nend-user and the customer, not walking up to the counter and sniffing the cap. That's right. I'll be honest with you, I would just forego smelling these\nterpenes at all, whenever you buy them. It's not an accurate representation. We\ndo not make perfumes, we make flavor ingredients, and those two things are\ncompletely different. Your customer will never smell your bottle of terpenes. The\nonly thing your customer is ever going to interact with is the pen. And what\nreally matters is what the pen tastes like, and that is a different formulation, okay? So luckily, the professor here has created a pen from the Blue\nDream, and he's gonna tell you the customer experience on what they're\ngonna taste like in a pen, the way we formulated them. All righty, here we go.\nTaste testing gauge. I'm getting a bit of a light gassy note in there followed by,\nsome would say, a floral note. And I can't stress this enough; it is a very,\nvery clean flavor, almost uplifting. It's crazy. That's right. A lot of our profiles are differentiated by whether they are separated profiles\nor combined profiles. Now a separated profile; you're going to taste those\ndifferent notes at different times. First you're gonna taste gas, then you're gonna\ntaste earthy, maybe citrus on the exhale. Combined profiles; all those blend\ntogether into one flavor. You taste it on the inhale and the exhale. Where's the Blue Dream come out? I would categorize the Blue Dream as a very well blended terpene profile. Meaning that you're gonna be able to taste that really clean\nflavor, that gassyness a bit in there, with those floral notes all mixed in\nthere, from inhale to exhale. So we have this designated as a light cannabis\nprofile, meaning that it tastes of-like cannabis. It's not a super robust G 13,\nit's just a light cannabis profile. Now that is different from how strong the\nactual profile is. There's the cannabis level of it, and then there's the strength of\nthe profile, in relation to other profiles. For example, six drops of this\nversus six drops of this. This may be really strong, this may be really light. So where do we fall under the strength of the profile? Blue Dreams, I believe, is\ncategoried into our medium strength profiles. The other thing we do is we base this on\nwhether they are enhancing agents or masking agents. Some of the products we design are created specifically to mask your cannabis, so that you can smoke in\npublic. Some of them were meant to enhance it so everyone knows you're\nsmoking weed. Where do we lye on this guy? Blue Dream is an enhancer. That's\nright, that's right.

and now you turn this back on is hot [Music] see this stuff's good to get again [Music] [Music] yeah very good taste I don't know that community so yeah [Music] you're brand new people no no come on we are the best freedoms in the area you know Ruby this month I and I know look timeand og [Music] go until I've been Chokin 420 you know hey look how resonated that is Dimond oh she [Music] [Music] [Music] when you pour the mushroom yeah white and check it out man I bought this alone for 20 and the first thing it did not even three seconds from heating it up as well for us to use [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "D5dj6yzbIls": "well that's going on YouTube be easy here we're on day 26 flower here in a little grow tent we've got the candy crush and we have the blue dream as you see they're [ __ ] huge pretty breasts this candy kids got really gonna tell you see it's like an inch away from the edge of the light they're not a problem i guess they do it up get camera good and you see it's just solid meditation a lot of you solid vegetation towels and you see if we're good here in the blue dream really frosty to get real stinky the Nick burns starting to go away and then just give them fresh water the last two feedings so I'll probably give them another feeding I've been doing the same given this just fresh water and it's definitely starting to get hungry see that but yeah this thing is just just just huge um I mean here's massive should be a pretty good decent meal be interesting to see house turns out they're starting to fill out real nicely i wish i had some of them method 73 get in and see the sugar maybe i'll do a night video here pretty soon and there is happy extremely healthy doing what they do in 26 of flour see they're all lollipop now all the branches see I've got it staked up a lot to the branch is starting to get to having a lot of a sudden lay down this has got a couple states and in that the genius seal it just worked out wow wow pretty cool I like it the old fence stop whenever you want to call it treats from yeah all right until take a look in the bedroom real quick like grateful dead poster pretty [ __ ] cool oh yes there's the big huge super stunt still haven't done anything with it I really need to this is just no room in the flower tent right now I mean I probably could throw it in there but it's only an optimal light let me get optimal yield so I almost kind of I mean I spent a long time and I don't I mean it might surprise the [ __ ] out of me and just explode and throat when I put it in the flour might just shoot up I don't know but I really like the way it's going rate them make sure want to get a couple good clones of this because that's a badass fino of a super skunk if anyone's grown super skunk you know what I'm talking about you know when i get [ __ ] 56 feet before even know what happened but these are blue dream clones they actually survived and rooted I looked at him one day and all of a sudden I was like [ __ ] they started coming back and I looked at their roots and they were just exploded but yeah we've got all those are the blue dream these two big ones here which I've already topped our candy crush clones and I gave the rest to other caregivers caregiver but yeah this one I'm really upset I thought it was dying and I saw I didn't water it and then I went to look at it and look at that they're almost still really white I don't know if i watered and I doubted come back but yeah look at that thing I had no idea it was living it was kicking [ __ ] ass blew it [ __ ] blew it this one had a route to [ __ ] blew it ruined it effed up be easy at not in the clone dome but yeah look at this big emerald beauty I think I totally knocked over my fan in my flower room because it is tickin really really bad right now I don't know if you guys can hear that in the background probably not but yeah I want to cut this video off before that thing blows up all right thirteen percent out of here", "WFOmLLHl0Wo": "what's going on YouTube be easy here doing a little update showing you guys what they look like before i do my lollipop in cloning which I would be doing later today when i get off work just doing this real quick video here and snorted so now you can see they're extremely healthy no burns at all very big very [ __ ] see that i had to move the Super Skunk over here and turn on another light yeah that's really healthy a big green bush a bush too but yeah I mean you can see it's been like I know maybe a week I don't know exactly when I posted last video when I cage these again you see there now over top of them a lot actually have to raise the light a little bit be out there gonna be beast beast bushes me I don't know if you've seen a seven gallon pot but you see top of the point and then see how big the pots are get an idea of how big they actually are but yet alright be easy out enjoy this little beds video because next time you see them they will be lollipop k and almost ready for father", "eeg8au4I4vI": "hey guys welcome back this is Belle BC here doing another video episode of growing for freedom and as you guys can probably see here in this video we are hanging out in the epic 4000 watt the record breaker or at least we hope it will break the all-time record that we set with blue dream a long time ago the last time that we grew blue dream but as you can tell guys in this video we are doing things a little bit differently with the dubbed audio actually still don't have my Panasonic camera with me I've left it over at the other spot because we are getting ready to make some videos from HQ but I am waiting for all the work to be done there first and we're still wrapping things up although a lot has been done and I'm really excited about what we're gonna be doing here with the new moneymaker 4k nursery but that is the subject point of the video let's talk about what's been going on here in the gardens so you see that we're running around basically just getting multiple Vantage's of the enormous buzz that we've been growing here the the blue huge strain has definitely not disappointed this time around the buds at all areas guys are just absolutely huge and I'm gonna try to get as close as I can in here with my 24 millimeter prime lens and I do apologize again for the the lens there's no image stabilization it's a geared lens I'm like trying to like frantically mechanically operate this thing but the shots actually got a pretty decent I'm actually trying to get a little more used to shooting with primes for up-and-coming projects so although I don't plan on doing on the handheld quite like this it still helps you know to become a little more adept at using them but yeah guys the Blue Dream is just doing great I'm pretty sure that at this point we are definitely going to you know exceed seven I think we should definitely be able to at least match the best that we had ever done before with this it I'd be somewhat surprised if we didn't quality factors though I think that this one could shape up to be one of the great only because the fact that just done such a great job of maintaining the the canopy quality you know the buds everywhere around are just getting access to such great light and the feeding has also been perfect no real complaints there at all whatsoever I think the only thing that I really wanted to complain about I think with how the plants you know not having to deal with the light you know light bulb going out at everybody but with the plants themselves we did or we have had plants that are consuming a lot more water than others so it is difficult you know to keep them on a unified watering but aside from that guys it has just been absolutely spectacular the the regimen that I use to vog you know obviously the every 16 basis combined with advanced and botanic here a little bit of GH additives you know basically the mixed I've talked about in previous videos it does incredibly well for blue dream and that's pretty much what I anticipated as well you know obviously with the SF EOG being as finicky as it is whatever really does well for that is obviously going to be really good for the blue dream which is a plant that just you know seems to probably it just does good on anything really you know I know a lot of other people that run different feed regimens that get similar results so this is just a really kick-ass strain one thing to that we're changing up here at the end is that we are starting flushing a little bit earlier I'd mentioned I think in my previous video that we didn't update from here that I wanted to try to sneak in one more full-strength feeding but that is just not gonna happen day 70 is gonna be I believe the second to last day of the month and that's what we plan to take these things and that's generally what always gets it done so with that being said I decided to instead start just flushing the plants that would give us about 11 or so days of flushing maybe a little more I lost the exact account but we are gonna be able to get at least I think three you know full-blown freshwater inches through these plants heavy floodings and remember the last reservoir that was fed the plants wasn't tapered down and we did not put any Spikers in that either so after we gave the the plants that really big full strength feeding with basically all the additives you know the highest ppm single feeding the next taper down or the you know the diluted reservoir had no additive Spikers and then we're leading these things right into the flush so definitely gonna do a good job of getting all the nutrients out whatever salt buildup sand accumulations that might be there they're gonna pretty much be gone and then the plant should ripen pretty well we should see a lot more yellowing in the leaves and they'll be ready to come down here guys in just a little bit so that is pretty much it guys for this video update next view update we will definitely be going over to over HQ to check out all the new stuff that you've been doing we have done some drastic changes to the setup it's been it's been the first time we've done stuff like this in a while so it's gonna be really exciting guys check out the new production facility and to see how many clones we can produce guys is in its pre massive you know as we build out pretty much the largest you know nursery open to the public and also Cal so thanks all for watching see you all next time [Music] you", "UgXMuzyuWxI": "what's up YouTube welcome to the first

do it coming from be easy don't do gotta study but yeah alright anyway 30% er out", "qIzAiGAGmnc": "[Music] what's going on guys and welcome back to another md fish tanks build video so behind me is my blue dream shrimp tank that i had set up for about a month now it is just a temporary setup so the plan was always to do a nice skate for them as well and we are now at a point where we can do that so let's crack right on with the build so one of the first things that i need to do is actually take everything out of the tank and put it into a bucket that includes the plants the soil the aqua soil you know even that leaf and that moss ball and including the filter i need to keep the sponge filter running so that it's basically everything there is now in a bucket that i don't have in front of me anyway that doesn't matter i'll get a bucket but let's just put it all in now [Music] click subscribe right there we go nice empty aquarium love it this is the exciting part so i've kept the soil down here in the bucket the sponge filter is ticking away there with the water that was in the aquarium and all the plants the shrimp are up here all doing absolutely fine they'll be fine in there whilst we're doing the build but the first thing i want to do is get some media in some bags these are the bags i'm talking about here so these are all made of plastic even the zips plastics there's no danger of any sort of you know rusting or anything like that i want to put lava rock and the aquasol in this bag the reason is i want to put sand in the aquarium like i want a different look so we haven't just got aquas all the time but i still want to keep the soil contained now i know that if i don't keep it contained and just put it underneath the sand the shrimp will get it out it'll come forward it'll get annoying increase maintenance time all that we don't want any of that so we're going to put it on the bags and just lay on the bottom first [Music] so yeah we've got crushed lava rock in this one we've got aqua soil in this one mix them together in the bags and then we're sorted [Music] so the reason for the media in the bags is for two reasons actually one it adds height to the back which means we don't have to use an absolute ton of sand to fill it out two it stops the sand compacting and three well there's three reasons all right three is extra sort of surface area for beneficial bacteria and this will just make the tank even more healthy because the filtration is only going to be one of these little sponges like you see in this tank and it's not huge surface area is it but we've created a ton more now and height and you know it's gonna work perfect but let's get our sand in and i've got quite a lot to choose from um i don't know i think i'm gonna go for more sort of a whiter sound so this hugo kamishi that's a quite good one i like that i think we'll go with that [Music] so that's quite a steep angle but that's going to give us sort of a depth look to the tank and also more substrate you better plant into as well because i want to actually plant it in some areas i want to keep it clean in the foreground and clear to be honest and i'll probably make a border so that it's like separate to the back and then have a nice little dish that we've got here you can see where you can't really see it because it's being surrounded by that hair grass but i've got like these cute little dishes that i can put in for the for the shrimp to feed in so i want to have that in the foreground but we'll just see hard skate wise i want to go for sirius stone [Music] yes we've got a nice good selection here i mean some of these bits are quite big but maybe we should just go for it i'm going to stick some in and see how it looks i might need to break some up or might not let's just have a go [Music] well that is quite bold but i really like it i did actually just shove it in there just to see you know roughly where if it would fit for size and then i just plunked it down a step back like now but look at that that uh that looks really good i don't want it on its own maybe another small one that way one that way and one that maybe i just you know a few smaller ones i'm not even sure yet i just keep going just keep going [Music] yeah i really like that so this rock is slightly different sort of color but not something i'm going to worry about it'll all get a sort of you know just dusting of algae anyway kind of like these rocks in here you can see they've all got that sort of greeny tone to them which i really like it looks awesome but the reason i've gone for the whiter substrate on this well it's an off-white if you like is because the blue dream shrimp were getting sort of darkened out on the dark substrate so i couldn't even see a lot of them um apparently they do go darker on darker substrate as well so now that i've got the light one they're gonna be like proper vibrant and blue now i've only put those three stones in there obviously and i want to do more than that because in nano tanks you can very quickly just start sort of putting way too much in and before you know it it can just look a bit of a mess but that's nice and simple i like that so we've got two going in one direction and then one in the opposite direction that's enough we don't need any more i want to put loads of different like plants in that all around this as well so it should look pretty cool i might build up that back area a little bit more though only because i don't want like dead zones behind there there will be some dead zones obviously but if i build up a little bit higher i'll also be able to see around there more actually can i see around anyway this way oh yeah i can see all the way around that's awesome okay yeah no need i'll just leave it as it is and it just gives more space then for the stem plants to grow but currently obviously there is no nutrients in this this gravel it's just or sand it's of course sand fine gravel there's no nutrients for any plants to grow so we need to put some root tabs in nice and simple just push it in under the gravel to as low as you can go wherever you're going to be putting plants now i don't know where i'm going to be putting plants so i'm just going to put it everywhere and just hope for the best [Music] well that's looking great i'm just going to fill up the water now and just get planted straight away like that i don't want to put loads of stems in that flop over i can't see how they're looking i want to fill it up and get planted straight away obviously i'll leave a little bit of a gap so that i can actually put my hands in without it all overflowing i don't usually do it this way but i just want to give it a go let's try another way and hopefully it'll look good straight away [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and you know what i might as well just put the filter in as well and just that way we know where it's going to be when we're planting and there'll be space for it [Music] right that's all bubbling away i let that all clear a bit because it's got a bit misty because i've disturbed it a little um but yeah we'll come back and plant it once it's clear it'll look better then don't know why i'm saying that because the second i put something in it's gonna create dust anyway it's okay it's okay so it is now the next day since we filled it up the water's crystal clear oh all the lights are coming on it's very early in the morning you see that you probably tell for my voice but yeah now looking at the tank i think i want to add some details to it just give it a bit more of a natural look so yeah look we've got some really nice clean lines the filter fits nicely working away purifying the water or making it look perfectly clean anyway but this foreground is a little bit too clean i do want it to be clear in the foreground like right there but maybe i'm going to add some detailed stones around all these rocks just some small pebbles that sort of have got got that grayish look and i can do that by selecting something from here one of these maybe we've got some delay sort of chippings and different different gravels and that i'll have a little look and then we'll put some in so in this bag down here i've actually got like a mix of a ton of old different pebbles and completely different sizes in here and i think that that will work really well yeah i'm gonna put it in so obviously the best thing would have been to have done this yesterday before i filled it up but you know you live and learn [Music] okay not my greatest of ideas but let me just i'll just do a quick water change with some dechlorinated water so we don't affect the filter remember the filter cycled so we don't want to just be putting chlorine-filled water in that will just destroy any beneficial beneficial bacteria that's colonized on it but also i want to be able to see what i'm doing so let's just get our water out put it back in again [Music] okay there we go yeah a little bit fuzzy but that's more sort of bubbles in the water than actual floating particles but that's absolutely fine it's going to get a bit stirred up as we plan anyway i don't know why i'm doing it but like this by the way but i just want to try something different so i can literally see how it's going to be straight away rather than you know planting and then filling up and being like oh that's all there and that's what you know i just want to try it this way just see so the first thing i want to do is start getting some of the foreground started before i move on again this is backwards and i'm going to start at the back and come forward but all the details are at the front here i really like how this has turned out actually to be honest looks so natural isn't it it looks like a little outcrop you'd find like near the beach or something oh beautiful [Music] so there's three of the plants that i want to use in sort of the foreground progesterone erectus now this is actually quite a tall plant but you can keep it short quite easily it doesn't grow massively fast especially with no co2 or anything or you know i'm not using massively high lighting either then we've got s weapons next to it i've always struggled with this plant but hopefully we can get some success in this tank and then this one at the end here pagostamin hal how fairy anyway that stays nice and small and it's all sort of like carpets a bit like uh s weapons when you trim it and then you can replant it and trim it and replant it and trim it and replant it and then you just cover the whole bottom so these are the um one two grow range from tropica basically there's no pest or anything like that in them and they're just like they're like baby versions of the plant if you like and i've always found that if you use the the one to grow in new setups they adapt really well sometimes potted plants can melt back and and that but these that never seem to for me so yeah give them a go plus their small size also means they're going to suit the escape really well [Music] and there we go just a little couple of hints of the s weapons and that's enough really because obviously a small skate before you know you're going to fill it up anyway so moving on now we're going to put the pagostemen hella fairy hello ferry yeah [Music] okay looking good looking good right next up we've got some liliopsis brazilian hem helianthum tenolum green i'm getting good at this so the reason i'm adding more is because these are sort of like finer uh shooty ones shootie plants if you like whereas these are more stumpy so i want to just mix it up a little bit get it in and amongst it just add a little bit more detail that's all [Music] yeah i've just realized now is actually a really good time to put the shrimp bowl in so just to make sure i don't cover up that space with any plants so the reason we put a bowl in is so that when we feed the shrimp we can see how much they've eaten and then we can remove what they haven't eaten very quickly and easily just with a turkey based dust so just put it in suck it out of that bowl job done if it's all in the substrate and falling in amongst it and implants and you're not going to catch it all are you but with this you can catch all of it which is why for instance in this tank look if you look down in that little one there's no food at all because i've sucked it all out and ready for the next feed and this is just because shrimp can be quite sensitive and you know water volume in this tank isn't a massive amount it's a really weird way of saying that there's not a lot of water in this tank so it can be quite easily fouled so we can just make sure basically we're taking out any waste but i think that's a really good amount for the foreground plants remember all this stuff's going to grow really quickly so i don't want to just fill it right out instantly and not have any progress to watch and now moving on to stem plants for the back of the tank again stem plants are really really good for small setups purifying the water when you haven't got a ton of you know filtration plants are nature's filter they work so good i mean all of my tanks are pretty much filtered nowadays but i could probably for instance with this tank here i could probably take out the this an awasee but if i took out that 250 it would probably be absolutely fine you might get a little bit of haze to the water but in terms of water chemistry it wouldn't be affected at all with the bio load that we've got in there which is these uh emma tetras which are thinking that i'm about to feed them and i'm not because it's very early still nighttime now we definitely need some red in this tank so if you come over to my better sorority tank over here look we've got some really really nice rotala hr which is just starting to get to the point now in height where it will soon be properly read from the light so the closer it goes to the to the surface or the light source the redder it will get just like these red root float as you can see on the surface here which are gorgeous hello hello ferella but yeah i'm going to do some trimming and take some of those again it means that these will grow more compact and more shoots every time you trim a stem plant two shoots come up so we're actually making it more [Music] so i was watching some aquascape tutorials on green aqua channel actually and one of the i think it was josh sim who said that if you've got something impactful it needs to sort of go on both sides so that's why i've added in the rotala hr that side and that side just a little hint of it and i think that'll look really good especially with the greenery that i'm going to have swooping over the background now if you notice in other tanks i've obviously got clumps of plants like that one and that one now they're all sort of held together at the bottom with a bit of um you know weight and filter floss so this one originally had some in there's some down here in the bucket and i just took one apart because i don't want to use the limb the feeler in this one because it's quite sort of but so i've taken out some of the rotalas now they're quite long so i'm gonna get them all to correct size it's a mix of rotala green and rotala rotundifolia and they're already so healthy and they just get the tank off to a flying start they've got beneficial bacteria all over them to help colonize the new new tank we'll be adding beneficial bacteria as well anyway so but yeah you always reuse old plants if they're healthy and good like look at that one like why would you not use that looks so good [Music] so there's the rotunda folio bunches in they're looped over slightly weird but that's just how they were in the other the tank previously they were obviously bent i don't know really but they'll straighten out it only takes like a day or two for them to straighten out and they'll be looking great but now that can't be it we need one more fine textured green for the background and i've got just the plant it is over here in the tank storage plant this is going to be a really cool escape at some point soon but for now it's holding plants for me a lot of plants as you can see but this is the one i want it's like ah what's it called home let me look it up milfoil that's what it's called so it grows crazy fast so i'm gonna have to keep up on it like because very quickly it can like triple in size in like a week but it's really really vibrantly green really nicely fine textured as well and you know just super easy plant i haven't actually seen it that often i've only seen it in the last few months and i just grabbed it and was like wow this is great why why don't we see this more often but yeah loving it so there's just one more thing i want to add before we're done and that's some floating plants i might take them out a later date but to start with it's going to be really good at keeping the nutrient levels down and just keeping a flood of algae away algae will build up like it does on this tank on the sides which is good that's what we want for the shrimp but it just stops all the rocks and the gravel the diatom all of that it will just help massively just to start with the flowing plants i'm gonna use are over here so in this this is like a sort of black watery sparkling grammy tank i've made hello fella look how good they look so sparkly that's what they call them sparkly grammys sparkly grammys no sparkling gouramis hello sparkly grammys anyway i am after the salvinia that's floating on the top there's not a huge amount there because i fished a load out and actually put them down in this bucket so i'm going to take them from there and then put them on the surface and there we go that's going to massively help to start with and they're cute little floating plants as well they don't get massive long sort of roots that go all the way deep into the water like frog bit that i've actually pulled that because it was so long whereas the salvinia it doesn't seem to do that it just keeps it sort of about that length we've got now to an inch yeah ideal right that's it i think we're ready to rock and roll and get the shrimp in their new tank so i've just transferred the shrimp over and they're now doing laps in this jug it's like the shrimp olympics anyway let's put them in that seemed to go really well everyone's sort of strolling around they already look good they look just look good oh love them love them so one of the things i need to do now that i didn't do last time when i did a re-skate was add beneficial bacteria you need to get it straight in i'm going to do it every single day for a week and i'm going to double the dose because why not [Music] [Applause] [Music] so another thing that i'm going to add in is some bacter ae this is basically something that creates a biofilm on everything the tiniest of little amounts goes in now and that should do the trick [Music] and there we go we're all set up ready to go i think it looks great it just needs time now to grow in i'm going to stay on top of the maintenance to trim in the replanting it's going to look absolutely fantastic in no time at all notice guys i also put the snails back in some people are like i hate snails always use snails in your tanks nails are amazing like don't worry about them like breeding too much the the population it sort of limits itself based on the amount of waste food that's available so if you don't over feed your tank you just won't get a ton so this tank had been set up for like two months if you notice i only had about six seven snails in there and they're ramsan snails and bladder snails which are renowned for breeding massively so just goes to show don't over feed and you won't get a like massive population increase in snails and then they can just carry on doing their job really well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so you", "dYzrjqEjEEM": "what up YouTube the UK back veena on down time for a while but the stardom I check back just for sex glancing at the minute we got our blue dream

I'm hoping that they're gonna pull through and you see that when there's not as bad on that leaf but the main parts of the plant themselves are alright so they should be able to pull through these

see blue dream I mean I see it all over the place it seems one of the most popular strains out there virtually everybody likes that's a great strange period smoke hi everything blue dream is one of the most commercially successful strains in California it is like the McDonald's of marijuana back in 2004 when I was growing it with my business partners it was very new it looked different and so it's sold very very well my name is Beth and I'm one of the original growers of Blue Dream I made it popular I had just graduated college early and moved to San Francisco to work for a law firm and was hanging around with a couple like DJs who were very much into the nightlife scene one of my deejay friends like hey like I know of this after-party and it happened to be house and we met it was like fireworks like immediately became in love like it was just an instant connection that we had with one another and ever since been we kind of became inseparable and he told me that he was a freelancer he had like three or four little plans alight and I was like very cute and humble and I told him during that kind of like look don't fall in love with me because I'm moving to New York and I'm going to law school and he very concisely drafted a million dollar cash business plan that he presented to me in an excel sheet that said and this is how you're gonna make your first million dollars in cash honestly at 21 the idea of being hundreds of thousand dollars in debt and moving to New York versus traveling the world and doing it cash and tax free sounded pretty awesome it was really important that we were creating something that was visually beautiful and that it was packaged in a way that made it sexier and for me it was creating a brand story because the market was so flooded with so many other strains that were being grown outdoors I was what's cool about blue dream is that like the buds are so blue and crystally and they smell awesome because that was the only strand we were growing and we were flipping it every eight weeks we were able to tip the market because it was like what is this new strand where is it coming from and how that were able to get so much of it all the time I met the buyer that bought for 17 different locations in Southern California loved it he was like we're not getting this kind of stuff in Los Angeles this is going to fly off the racks in LA and because they were flooding the LA market with it we couldn't keep up with it which has been when we got our second house between 2006 and 2008 it was the most popular it was the hottest people wanted it everywhere I quickly realized that they were taking our products marking it up and then driving it down there and getting almost twice what we were getting here in San Francisco for it so when I realized that there was a large margin that I was missing out on I started doing it I was only like 22 and drove the horrible speed limit of like 55 miles an hour down the 101 to 5 yeah it was a little bit scary you know to be doing what we were doing and I didn't want to get in trouble I didn't want to get busted I didn't want to spend days in jail because I was growing plants don't get caught yeah I would think about my family a lot you know I'd be like don't get caught guys don't get caught I visualize what my life would look like when I was done and out of this job out of his career like what are my next steps and knowing that like this was not going to be it for me it's just something that I didn't want to do as a lifelong career and eventually I made my goal and I got out I learned so much from my experience and growing blue dream I learned about relationships about trust you know I always tell people yeah I mean money grow on trees before I made flower arrangements for brides and grooms I learned to use the things that I had and the tools and the gifts that I had to be much more successful [Music] [Music]", "LmBGsBkrFS4": "Hey guys welcome back to Greenbox Grown.\u00a0 My name is Dylan and today I am going to give\nyou an update on my Current Blue Dream Grow. \u00a0\nSo first off I want to give you some background info on this grow.\u00a0 I am growing 4 blue dream plants in this greenhouse\u00a0\nwith a coco coir / perlite mix and they are in week 7 of Flower.\u00a0 Also they are being grown in 7 gallon smart\npots, and I am using the Fox Farm Dirty Dozen Nutrients pack on these plants.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHere is a quick close up of these buds.\u00a0 And as you can see they are getting really\nfrosty and are starting to get some orange hairs at the top.\u00a0 What you cant see from home is the smell,\nwhich is incredible.\u00a0 I have always been a fan of the Blue Dream\nHigh and Smell, so I\u2019m stoked to finally be growing it myself. \u00a0\nI am currently growing through some pretty frigid conditions so that\u2019s why I have that\nheater in here.\u00a0 That little guy will actually allow me to\ngrow through snow if I wanted to. \u00a0\nYou can see a couple of our branches didn\u2019t make it through the SCROG so I used some string\nto hold them up a little closer to the lights.\u00a0 \u00a0\nI\u2019m really happy with the way these Lollipoping has held up through Flower.\u00a0 I have only had to trim it up once so far.\u00a0 Again here is another shot of how well these\nbuds have developed so far!

"[Music] [Music] which is my hello medical marijuana grow-ops and for those of you guys that haven't been following along and haven't really updated this garden in a while I think last time I updated it was when we flipped this garden to flower actually but you can see where we far surpassed that or actually I'm thinking around the sixth week in this garden now but for those guys that have not followed along this is a 6000 watt adjusting garden it's in approximately like a 10 by 20 space and there's 25 plants in here only intended to have 24 but I gave him one snare and he actually just threw it in the middle and she's got the biggest [ __ ] butt out of all of them which is hilarious but yeah there's 25 plants in here and you know things have just been looking really great you know the buds are getting big they're getting nice and frosty see I think I kind of briefly touched on the nutrients that we were running last time but I'll just kind of go roaming in really quick is we've got we're running the house and garden AME base with the bud candy at one point another we ran all of these the roots accelerator the budding so top booster don't think we're using shooting power this time we are using the overdrive but he also is running a liquid karma and hikers I'm you know but should get good stuff and you know with the addition of you know the three additional lights this grow I'm doing a mono crop style grow with all the same strain you know a little bit of updated on the the nutrients you know we definitely converted this grow to 100% cocoa like I've done in my rooms and it's made all the difference in the world for the success of this garden you know I've been really happy with the way this canopy has turned out you know it's really even and believe it or not guys this is only my buddy's second grow the last grow that I showed you with the Blue Dream in the purple cushion here under a few thousand watts was his first grow and that was really just with me helping him set up the garden kind of showing him what you need to do and you know do it himself and this time I haven't been here at all since the last video you know so he's done all six weeks by himself and yeah guys I mean it just looks great some of these buds are even bigger than ones I've done without co2 if you look at this big fattie thing definitely got some time to go looking great so basically what I extracted to do if you wanted me to see how far away they were from being finished and in my opinion there I think there are news that they're on bad day 43 or 44 in the moment so he's going to actually give these plants for one more feeding of the overdrive and after a couple days is gonna start diluting that solution down into just kind of reduce the concentration a little bit as we wind towards the end of this grow and yes so we are basically shooting for about a 60 to 63 day harvest in this room which is going to put it right on line with a lot of my other blue Dreamgirls in the past so you know I'm really excited to see the bro you know I think it's definitely more successful growth in the past so I think that's pretty much it you know he has added a couple small things you know we've got another fan of here on this wall now isolating you got another fan up there on that wall back there oscillating we also added in let's get back here got it in a an intake right here so all the we've got a the 8 inch exhaust back here in this corner and any negative pressure that's created is brought in through this fresh air duct here from the garage and then all of the air Kushner's and heaters are set on opposing schedules and what that means is you know that this small 12,000 BTU wall not on this side is keep that it keeps it cool when it's running or when the lights are on and during the winter time we've got this guy which is a 24,000 I think and that works as a heater to keep the room nice about 65 68 degrees during the lights-off cycle which is about exactly where you want it that helps keep the the blood density really nice and tight so that's basically you know all we've got going on in this grow you know it's gonna be a couple more weeks and then we should be looking at harvest and once we get the numbers and everything we will keep you guys all updated and I'm not sure exactly we're gonna grow in here next it's probably gonna be a company either of another round of you dream or the the Green crack I'm not exactly sure yet it's gonna really depend on my clone numbers cuz I just don't know what the hell I'm gonna do yet so yeah guys I think that's basically it oh yeah one other addition was I got a little diamond fire right here in the back just to keep things in check but the conditions in this room geysers awesome never emitting spike or temperature spike so these blue jeans are definitely doing very well very very happy with this garden right now so if you guys have any questions please let me know other than that we will see you guys next time you", "V3VBVhloncs": "what's up everybody that's for us here good morning hope everybody's having a good day you got a two different things here for you I got a little

"IkoR-sgosIM": "good evening everyone just doing a quick update super Lemon Haze we are one two three a lot more popcorn everybody looks happy nice and lush turning in some precise comparison for you guys she just took off this last week she's finally done stretching [Music] [Applause] I ain't on in this life but I got no other options you guys are stuck with it [Music] so far so good other than super soil the only other additives really have been build a soil there aloe Coco and potassium silicon as soon as I started using those three my branch diameter is much better [Music] much sturdier [Music] yeah anyway and then in the blue dream still out of control [Music] she is pay 51 so not too much longer leaves are about done in the light stress last time here on this indoors I think this summer I'm actually gonna try to throw on living together [Music] and out the biggest but there's a lot [Music] so anyway that should be it for now see you guys later", "Iy2qQbNmtGI": "hey I got that seconds ago huh lot of these [ __ ] lost [Music] chickens an awful lot of these [ __ ] little oh they broke they think it's my fault don't smoke we blowing Oh coach I want that [ __ ] see coach I'm trippin I'm stuck with the sauce yo [ __ ] be [ __ ] me wrong but she let you don't cut the [ __ ] off Brenda Levin she is right let me there Louie that's right right from the city that's life led look at the light [ __ ] don't like put your fingers", "KoX9vDNBeyo": "[Music] what's going on YouTube Kerr MD and we're back over here as I am following up on the Blue Dream Green crack cannabis crow that we got going on in here and just wanted to take a little quick second to update you guys as to how the girl is going and some of our observations so let's just jump right into it first and foremost I think today's are either on day 43 I'll put the exact date in the video description but I think we've got about two to two-and-a-half weeks left in this garden about guarantee week of that will be one more week of feeding and then the next about ten days or so we'll be done with flushing and I got to say I'm pretty happy with the way things are coming in this garden obviously the disparity in terms of height is a little bit more evident when things start to really pack on weight I would say that these plants getting a little taller getting a little bit bigger bugs but I think they're seeing a little bit more stress from being taller and closer to the light than what I'm seeing down here in the shorter half of the garden come these these buds over here on the shorter half filling in pretty nicely they're not getting outrageously thick but they have more of a standard shape to them these buds over here you can see they're just huge in terms of the size I mean I can I can't grip them right now but they've got a little bit of fog feeling kind of going on the ends and I really do you think that's just because of co2 this room's been lower than what I've done in the past in my rooms but I think it might be sealed potentially a little bit better I'm not a hundred percent sure and I think it's just a lot of co2 in the room is really making the fox feeling going on we've raised the lights up a lot I don't think the lights particulars should be you know causing stress I'm leaning more towards co2 mainly from this this bud right here you can see this one he's kind of just flipping you off this little long awkward top right here this but it's tough it's absolutely huge I mean it's getting nice and thick and hard and everything but it's not anywhere near any of these lights you can see it's got a lot of distance it's essentially you're right in the center of all four reflectors but it's lower than the rest of them you know right next to a lot of other very normal-looking buds and even this guy right here is no taller and it's thicker doing just fine so that's why I'm leaning towards it being co2 so starting this week we're cutting the co2 back down to a thousand PPM's we've only been running at about 1400 in this room the entire time but yeah and so on top of that we're continuing along with our house and garden feeding schedule everything is basically the same application rates as the last video that I just made we are using the golden tree still and so far so good looks to really be helping these plants boost up I think it's gonna be a great yield in this room you can see just right through this section there are just a lot of fatty-fatty buds so getting really excited to see these things all cut down also I'll be making separate videos about this in the near near coming future but I have started making plans and diagrams or my personal little grow room project that I got going on so you know for those you guys stay tuned and expect to see some build-out videos and some design videos on that and I'll be doing some QA for those you guys I have questions but it's gonna be really fun for me so I hope you guys stick around check it out so yeah plan moving forward like I said ten more day or seven more days of feeding about 10 more days after that of just pure water on a flush and this should be ready to come down somewhere in the day 60 ish range we are kind of on the schedule here since my buddy over at site M is going on a family vacation right after this harvest is done so there may be gap after this growth is over with before you'll see anything else coming in this garden I may still make a video while they're gone about the results but we'll take that one step at a time you want to get too far ahead of myself since I'm really just just trying to keep up with everything that I got going on and at this moment right now so anyway I'm just gonna walk around really quick here show you guys some of the buds and they're all still want me to talk about a little bit more about what golden tree does golden tree is really it really helps the cell division so it's going to allow your plants to really replicate faster and produce more increase their overall potential and so far it looks like after only about a week or week and a half of getting bad nutrient added to our regimen in this garden you know these plants have really blown up it is quite characteristic of Blue Dream to explode around this time frame of the guard of the Grove but I definitely think that the train has done quite a bit to help the plants a curly green and healthy and really happy so far so those guys the all the info is still in my last video for those of you guys that want to still try out golden tree and like I said before you can get a 10% discount by using grower md checkout so i encourage you guys to give it a shot and see what it does for you guys so there may be some additional stuff coming along with this coming shortly but I will make another video when all that stuff comes so I think that's about it everything else has been quite on cruise control with all the automatic feeding and everything else I think since it's been a while since I made a video about the functional aspects of this garden when this grow is over I'll try to get in here when it's all cleaned out and show you a little bit of what the garden looks empty what we do in between cycles for cleaning and maintenance things like that to make sure our growth keep moving nice and smoothly and yeah I think that's it we'll go over the drip system then I know a lot of you guys have questions about this this manifold system that we got going on over here so that'll be in one of these next videos as well and if you have any other items that you have questions on or want to see videos made of please email me do not leave your suggestions and questions needs in comments apparently I get spammed by a shitload of people trying to sell cannabis on my channel through the comments I'm gonna be more diligent about banning those people so they don't continue to just spam the [ __ ] out of my comments but in the meantime try to focus all your questions to grower MD at gmail.com I'll have a lot more access to get back to your questions from that venue so that is pretty much it I want to rant a little too much here but like I said if you have any questions comments please feel free to let me know other than that see you on the next one you", "Yew9raTvbqc": "hello everybody quick update we are let's see here day 17 of this super Lemon Haze really stretched this last week that's a better view well yeah taking off and she spread out really nice exactly what I was trying to go for anyone that's interested it's just three and a half nodes I have but yeah three nodes or so and then the blue dream good god I don't know if I've showed everyone this I just opted and then top the top so this whole thing is for branches that's it and the blue dream it's going along nicely 45 severely light stressed I don't know if you can tell them this light but pretty pale and then the back here great so I think I'm gonna move this other plant the haze up put it on a stilt or something and then turn my ballast down maybe to 750 but yeah those four branches came out very nice got one tall girl in the back that's not getting anyway but yeah so there's my quick quick quick update so blue dream super Lemon Haze see you guys next time", "kHgHFZ9uh38": "what's up YouTube Janie here is IL GM and today's stream is blue haze this is a sativa dominant hybrid with long bright notes and a sweet berry aroma this is an easy grill with medium tall plants high yields and a flower time of seven to nine weeks this is a cross

everybody there to go on here just I'll make another video and I know there was a few people asking about this blue dream auto sorry about the lights guys hope that's a just halfway decent but yeah anyways that this is the blue dream odo from a just hanging out a second I can't stay in that like just alright I'm back as that metal halides firing up but get back to this blue dream Otto right off the bat I started her and way too small of a pot I mean she could have done a lot better but I mean that's just a little itty-bitty one gallon and it's the way she's growing she's already you know sucking out the nitrogen out of her big families which I don't really like as much I mean I'll give her another feed at nitrogen but she's getting close and I just don't want to I don't know but most of it is because she's rootbound you know she's got roots coming out although you know the square holes on the bottom you know she's just root bound and but other than that I mean she would have been a beast of a plant she's got about two weeks to go and like I said she would have been a beast but I put her in this little one gallon pot and it's just you know it can only do what it can do with its you know feet all squished together and you know and then over here is that sweet tooth Otto same you know same situation it's in two small oil pot yeah that's that's the blue dream Otto loves the food as you can tell because it's you know would have been a lot lot bigger the truck production so far I mean it's okay nowhere near the way I think it should be but it she's got two weeks ago you know you never know if she could start selling something out there now as far as smell she's got that typical blue hazy snow you know typical blue dream smell I guess you could say you know like I said it's a she would have been an excellent plant if I would have put her in a big pot and just let her do her thing and if you guys go to now this is the dream from Humboldt seed organisation so if you guys go in that's the blue dream out if you take a look and get it they're a little expensive but you know it all depends on you know what you enjoy what you like and you know as far as taste and yield I don't know if taste yet but the yield like I said that's just in a little 1 gallon pot and it's you know it's doing really good for it a little one gallon another thing I wanted to show some of the people like the newbies and stuff like that I wasn't paying attention to this seed when I planted it it had a nice tail but it had a spiral tail going down and you know like I said I just wasn't paying attention to it I started messing with the photo period plants and you know wasn't paying attention to the autos like eye shadow and I paid the price for it because if I would have paid attention I would have noticed that it was trying to make the movies up there you know you can see these little roots down here if I want to have them covered up and it would have made routes and then they would have hit the air and then you know hardened off that way it would have been a lot different but is if you follow up with a stem because of them roots you see it got skinnier and skinnier and then it started to fill back out and that's you know that stunted the growth of the whole plane you know it's already started to find her again she's already started to flower on top you know it's just just pay attention to you know pay attention to your planes or even if you got a full room going you can save yourself a lot of heartache because like I said you know not all all those yes everyone has beginner's luck you're doing a lot of things you know but I'm just trying to you know it's explained some things that can happen you know when you're throwing hollows of course you know I growing up a dryer medium than most but that's you know that's me and I like I said I paid the price for you know they start to flower and everything this plant isn't gonna be nothing and it's supposed to be an you know an exhale large but like I said I can't blame the seed you know or the genetics due to you know them feeder roots trying to hang out the bottom you know and they just turned into little nubs so yeah that's that's you know that's definitely growers air I hope the wind isn't too bad I'll find out on a playback with a yeah I also want to show you guys oh sorry about that they need to know is you guys up come on what just wanted to ask you guys opinion on seat packaging right like I got this uh this Humbolt seats organization they're they're packaging it's pretty neat I mean you can use these as coasters it you know or whatever I mean it's just a neat little thing to you know a momento put it that way it tells the lineage you know some of the lineage and you know some of the information that you need to know about the plant and that you would like to know then I've got like this Barney's farm yeah I like this packaging that's kind of neat but on the back I'm thought I thought I would get to lineage and everything but more or less it's just a disclaimer you know and yeah I love the seed packaging cuz it looks like a seed you know that was kind of neat but where's the you know where's the lineage what's it made of what's the estimated days you got a you know you couldn't do any of that through and I know these are supposed to be souvenir packs but hey maybe as a souvenir we would like to know what is you know what's the how BIG's the plan get how you know how many days you know and flower if it's a photo period you know just stuff like that you know love Barney's farm but I just thinking I love this packaging and I understand about the disclaimer and everything but we were just like then I would like to know not we I would like to know a little bit more about the lineage and you know harvest time and stuff like that a little bit more about the plant now this is what I'm used to you know everything's in Spanish which hey if they're from Spain so you know I wouldn't expect us to have different languages over here on seed packages yet so but it it explains everything about it it gives you the lot number when it was made and all that and that is believe it or not that is important you know it used to be really important because if you know they've got a bad batch of seeds out there you know and you get a hold of company and let them know that if they still got that batch you know around they can look into the batch and you know see what's going on and again here's another one from you know Humboldt seeds you know like I said these are these are you know these are nice they they spent a lot of money into making these I know Dinah Femmes they've got their tins and I know they spend a lot of money into them but like I said I think that you know that's some quality there I know you guys don't might not think so and you know you're always going to have the smartasses in that in quality and at whatever I think they took their time and you know did good with their advertising now the packages that I like the most and it's the ones that like I said tell a little bit about the strain tell what's going on and actually have you know pictures of the strain and stuff like that you know I know it's just a picture and you know whatever but I just I enjoy see packaging like that now here with this is delicious seeds and you know this is I believe this is their critical Jack right here yep this is a critical Jack Otto I mean it is you know the colors of work always catches me in the magazines from delicious and then you know when you open it up it explains you know everything they've got like the perfume tester you'll see just a second sorry about that but like right here on the inside of the car it's got the the lineage you know it tells everything about the seed you know what to expect and stuff like that you know and again I hope you guys can see that and then you know of course you go in and then there's your seeds you know I like that packaging I don't know about everybody else but I enjoy seeing what else I can get you know a lot of people send their menus with them so did delicious you know they sent their whole menu which is basically in their whole seed packaging car like this one is I can't wait to start this one too so I guess I can show you guys this one this is critical Nevel Hayes 2.0 it's the classic Neville's Hayes that's the like a kick-ass you know it's some of the best Dutch haze that you know was out there for a long time and again it tells everything he tells you know your genotype your lineage the flower times the flower times outdoors the yield that taste the smell the effect the average THC amount the medicinal value I mean it's got everything it tells everything right there again you get the you know they show all three you know all of their lines they've got their automatic line their sativa line and their indica line you know and they spent a lot of time on you know on their packaging too you know and I mean yeah the cards might not cost as much and neither is the little perfume tester and everything but when you put it all together you know for individual strains that's you know that's quite a bit but yeah I can't wait to look out little them tiny little love sativa seeds are real real tiny sativa seeds but uh yeah that's just something that I just was looking at with the put the seed packaging I just thought you and I just smoked a bowl of course you know right before I came in here made this but I just don't oh I got the blue dream Otto in there that some people wanted to see some I wanted to talk to you guys about the seed package and see what you guys thought and see what you guys think to see packaging should have all right I mean with that I'm rambling I'm just out of it uh but yeah you guys I think you'd be enjoy because just think of how big just think of how big this would have got if I would have put it in a bigger pot alright with that my battery's getting ready to go and I'll talk at you all later you", "yPGR0OavHVw": "[Music] [Applause] you this is the blue dream deep cartridge it's almost done now I do want to know that good supply is also an affray accompany so a freons like good supply is a Frias over the counter or recreational brand so a lot of the terpenes are very similar to the ones that they have all in there wait for the actual medical prescriptions which is kind of interesting but I do find this one works a little bit better ice it's similar to like a Churchill as far as I find it gives me an indica of fact it makes me sleepy I can't really focus very much this one's supposed to have a very flavor to it I don't really feel that it's very berry eat it is sweet though it does say on the profile for it or the description that it's supposed to be sweet flavored why do you find it is fairly sweet so I woke up from that one but overall it is good I actually have a migraine and will probably use this to take a nap this afternoon because I have a migraine and I'm going to try and get some rest in because there's a thunderstorm coming and hopefully it won't wreck my body completely so so I will use this to help me with sleep and nausea I will try to sleep it off this migraine so as far as what I use this again yes I would I would use this one again I even think I might like this one better then the \u00e1free\u00e1 better than the Africa cartridges or at least not all not all of them because I really really like the Aspen but as far as and I teach the potency one I think I like this one better than the one that you can get on the prescription five for sure [Music] [Applause]", "c3wRCZPDypE": "[Music] come on guys let's go EMP continuing my video series for the Blue Room a 4000 watt blue Dreamgirl which is going to consist of 16 blue dream plants let's see I've got them all right here this is again going down eight plants around what I normally do to the via 24 plants so we're definitely cutting the numbers down significantly giving these plants a lot more space to fill out I've been really aggressive on topping these plants so you can see that the canopy is extremely even all these plants are really bushy multiple heads on all these plants you know the stalks are nice and thick already and the drip system in this room again is working awesome so the today is going to mark they wanna flower these plants have been sitting in just about exactly 48 hours just a little shy of that actually of darkness so you can see that the new growth is really light because they've been sitting in darkness for two days growing with no sunlight so it just got fed for the first time in two days with the beat one of bloom newts so they should Green right back up here the next day or so and they should really started to take off now I plan for this grow on the nutrients is to run a combination of the X nutrients and the psycho and what that's going to compile is the X nutrients full line which is going to be the grow bloom micro the amino blast and the bloom FX and and then I'm gonna be running pretty much all these of psychos additives so we're gonna be running the uptake thes I'm the doctor repair and the potash right now and I gonna run pretty much all of those except for the potash all the way through and then when we get to you know probably up the fifth week or so we'll probably switch over to these swell and see how this works compared to what I've done with blue gem in the past this would be like the third nutrient line that I'm running blues dream on so I think I should have a pretty good ability to gauge you know its its results and growth rates and stuff in comparison to what I've seen in the past I have to admit that I'm really looking forward to this grow having less plants in it I think in the end it'll work out to be less work around harvest time and it also gives me the ability to really have a lot of space to walk around and check out the veins and you know just really spend a lot more out close to personal time with the plants we'll have to see how this yield holds up holds up to when I run six points the light instead of four points the light but either way you know this thing's off to a good start and I'm really looking forward to you know the results of those things so I would say that from now on it's going to be cruise control just maintaining the the reservoir and the nutrients right now for the the first week or two up flower I'm gonna keep the ppm s for the co2 down to about 800 and I want to get past about that second week I'm just going to bump the PBMs up to probably about 13 14 hundred and that's pretty much the only modification I think I'm gonna have to make I'm not sure how much light adjustment I'm gonna have to do you can see there's still probably close to two feet between the the lights and the canopy right now and you know they do obviously stretch quite a bit but I don't know how dramatic it's going to be since I was really really aggressive on topping these plants they haven't been chopped in about a week so you can clear just now starting to recover and looking really awesome so we'll have to just see how this thing goes but I plan to just throw hopefully only one layer of trellis setting and here to support this canopy and I think that's all the only thing I'm pretty much gonna have to do so yeah I think that's pretty much it we will see you guys at the next video update what's going on guys let's go MD and here making the next video for the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow and again this is the you know room that we have now taken our numbers down to 16 plants in here although it might be hard to tell because these plants are just [ __ ] huge I mean you look at them from the side and yeah they're just extremely bushy lots of main notes on all these plants and I can just tell that you know the thickness of these stems means they're just going to be donkey dick colas and I am really really happy with the way that the canopy has just naturally filled in I really like the fact that I have less numbers in here because it was you know obviously a little bit easier to manage the pre veg you know I took a little bit less resources I would say with the blue dream strain in particular a didn't take really hinder my time by having to get these planes extra because these plants just grow really really fast anyway I would say that I really like the fact that I can walk around really easily in this screw you know the canopy is really maintained and due to the fact students the thickness of these stems and these stocks already I don't think I'm really gonna need to do much trellis netting here until we start getting into the budding weeks you know which should be happening over the next two you know they're starting basically after the end of next week it'll really start getting into the heavy budding at least at this strain so I think you know once I once I kind of start noticing that these you know coalesced are waving a little bit more than they do now in the wind then I'll probably throw up the trellis net and I think one layer should do it just the extensive amount of topping has really helped these plants just get really nice and sturdy so I think that with this strain particularly I will probably repeat this method only doing for plants perlite and I might even experiment trying this with a couple of my other strains but that's yet to be determined so yesterday the reservoir pretty much started to run out and I filled the reservoir up with fresh water gave them one quick feeding you know fresh water and then you know made them made up at new rez and what that basically compiled is for this run I don't know if I mentioned it on the percent but I'm going to be running the pull X nutrients line along with all of the psycho additives so what this week calls for is eleven hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 of the X micro and the it's amin oblast and and then on the psycho side we have 250 milliliters of potash 200 milliliters of uptake design and dr. repair we also added 250 milliliters of silica blast and 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's pretty much gonna do it for this week and the Blue Dream I know it can really take some pretty heavy feedings I'm not gonna really be topping off my reservoir right now I'm feeding them in line with what I I'm running on the green cracks right now and depending on how they look if they still look you know just as green and healthy and no burn and then everything as they do right now then I might up my PBMs from a little bit more than what it already calls for cuz it calls for a steady increase in the bloom for the first three weeks so I will probably do a little bit experimenting with that but as always I'll let you guys know what I end up throwing in the reservoir so this room is on cruise control the drip system has made all the difference in the world for me in terms of my management of these gardens the automation has made all of my room my firearms pretty much hands-free - filling up the reservoir which I'll have to do is turn this started hooked up to a flow valve and then I add the nutrients and then you know every other week I take that whole thing out clean it so but other than that you know the controller maintaining all my levels exactly where I need them I think I have my temp threshold set at about 80 to 83 degrees which is usually kicks a little bit lower than that it just runs a little bit harder because these sensors a little bit closer to the light but either way we're running the PPM's all the way up at 1350 right now yeah running with my 1350 just let them have it and I'll probably bump that up to about 1500 next week or so I'd say but controller keeping all my temperature humidity and everything in check and yeah that's basically it for now so not a whole lot going on in terms of development I can see they're just now getting ready to start you know popping out with pistols so I think by the next video we should have a little bit more interesting and interesting setup to look at and I have a 100% decided if I'm gonna go back in here and remove more of this undergrowth you know a lot of this stuff even though it's on the it's on the sides it's getting a lot of light but on some of them you know where it's interfacing it's not so I might pull these plants out of here and give them a nice you know lolli popping probably at the end of next week you know as usual when manigott I got through my second week of flower I typically come through one more time and clean them all up and just really try to get as much of the shrubbery and what would ultimately become those popcorn buds and those big major families that aren't gonna get any light and just kind of fall off anyway because we lacked nitrogen and that would really help you know promote all the growth upwards so that'll probably be the next step that'll probably be the net only change between now the next videos I'll pull this plants out one last time lollipop boom put them back in give them a little time to recover throw up a trellis net and it's rocky roll for the rest of the cycle it's not gonna be a problem and the thing that's really awesome about the drip system is that because I'm not using those emitters that actually puncture into the pot the tubing just kind of sits on it and then I have just one little small metal hook to just kind of hold the clip or the hold up to in place I can pull these plants out in here really easily and I don't have to [ __ ] with my drip system all that much or you know risk pulling the emitters out of the pots and pull it you know that can damage the root zone stuff too so this is kind of a hands hands off you know version of my drip system compared to what the roots I've had to deal with in the past so yeah so far so good guys we'll be we'll be back probably next week - next time alright guys what's going on back with the next video update here from 4000 watt room a which is the blue dream group featuring an ex and psycho nutrients together what I feel will be very very successful growth today we're getting the videos back on track putting today at 8:15 the first day of week three or the conclusion of week two however you want to look at it but we have three flowers and websites starting to come in not a whole lot of you know bras or anything really showing it to day 15 but you can definitely see that it's gonna be a nice full canopy he's got a lot of bad side strolling out looking really [ __ ] awesome really liking the way this room is looking at least with this particular string using for plants for light I think that the plains definitely respond better they spread out and allowed a lot more room for each of these colas and these buds is going to be massive I know last video I promised I would probably have the trellis netting up by now but I haven't really needed to do any are having needed to worry about the canopy moving at all because these stems on these colas was so thick you look at that compared to my thumb all the way here that's super thick so these blood sites are not really moving at all granted I do think that when they start to get real heavy we start having these big you know donkey dick colas here on the on these buds then I probably will need to build up a trellis net so I would imagine within the next week couldn't go much more than one or two more weeks max before they'll really really needed that so today is reservoir change day we ran out yesterday and I cleaned it out replaced it with a fresh one gave him one feeding of fresh water and today came in topped him off one more time and he went ahead and added the next few nutrients and what I did is put in twelve hundred milliliters of the X bloom 825 milliliters of the X micro and the amino blast and then I also put in 275 milliliters boom effect so we're starting that here you know about the third week at the recommendation of X nutrients you know their test grower that's his recommendation so we're starting that and we're also now going to continue off with the rest of our cycle additives which when we stepped up the potash or this week started in three hundred milliliters of potash 250 milliliters of silica blast 500 milliliters of sweet raw and then 200 milliliters of uptake as I'm and doctor pair so like I said the full X line and every out of it from psycho with the actually I'm the only one I'm not using this b-1b that's because I don't have enough to run it all the way through so anyway but yeah you know so far everything is just looking outstanding of no complaints jerk system is working fantastic not having to do any top offs this new version with one inch has definitely made all of the difference in the world getting rid of all that quarter-inch all my plant sites are getting the exact amount of water that I want now and the plants are just really loving the consistency of the feedings and the quantities really healthy garden right now really happy I am writing this thing at 1350 ppm still right now will probably step the co2 up to 1500 or 1450 in the next week or so when they really really start heavy budding but for now we're just going to let them get finished with the rest of their stretch I have been kind of adjusting the lights they're out there about 18 inches I would say above above the canopy and we're just gonna kind of keep it at that height in relevance to the canopy from you know as they continue to finish off their stretch I don't imagine that from here on out they'll stretch a whole lot more since they are starting to kind of sit down and develop their bud sites pretty nice I think additionally stretch you know another few inches or so so yeah that's pretty much it for this video the next video should be relatively interesting with a lot more bud development and we will be back next week to update you on the progress so till next time guys what's going on guys back with the next video update here from the room a 4000 watt blue dream grow featuring 16 blue dream plants running X nutrients and psycho additives so yeah you guys might notice that the trail set is up now in the script in this video and I just want to talk about that for a second here because one thing that I've pretty much always tried to preach to people is don't be the don't be the you know stereotype and what [ __ ] needs to get done don't put it off just get it done and your gardens will thank you for it and that's always basically been my style throughout this grow though I was kind of hesitant on putting up the the net for a little bit because I wanted to make sure that they can are stretching this planet back here [ __ ] stretch this [ __ ] ton more than the rest of these and so I wasn't sure they were so much eat up or what and since these branches were so thick I mean the stems are just ridiculously think of the top agiza I was like ah there's the thing they're good worry about it and I was planning on putting it up this Sunday and I got down here and I'm I was trying to finish my drip system and Home Depot ran out of the parts and didn't get it done I was driving all over the place trying to get you know some stuff and I was like I'll be good I'll do it on Monday when I get in and I get in yesterday and [ __ ] basically this whole front of my garden just was like laying on the floor basically these branches guys I let these plans get so pushy they eventually just pulled everything down with suicide heavy it just was making a mess you know put up the trellis man basically went in here and did a full-on volleyball session [ __ ] in there and I didn't see now step out of here there's a huge pile of brought down some huge branches too but I also lost a couple of big branches and in the process as they they came to UM Kings so far over that they snapped office then basically it was karma kicking me in the ass because I put it off so don't push it off that's the only thing that today's lesson will the plaintiff still looking good they're starting to offer back the child's name gentlemen some of these branches are still a little stunned see this guy right here he was falling over probably laying on the ground for a little while he's all over her some like these right here are I'm hoping they'll recover and I'm hoping that the net it's a promise it should provide us support checking along I don't know if I mentioned it but today is day 23 of flowering you just starting the four feet the reservoirs just topped off I've been running him out of fresh water for the last two days in the next couple days now Christel production on already pretty happy with the budget looking just pissed off that I I know what keeps me making sure I do anyway you can see that something next few weeks this garden comes so I'm just going to hit him up with the next week in nutrients and the next day or two I'm just gonna kind of flush them out like I said that's gonna let see I think I step up 1375 of the S bloom a 25 of them you know accidentally and then we're going to with a psycho evidence which is dr. hare to millions for all of these doctor repair design of tea right now we're still running the - the potash is at 300 milliliters we're also running 500 milliliters of sweet raw and it's 250 million silikal glass that's pretty much it for this video we'll be back at the next one you", "3Uc_iTiCE1c": "all right how's it going everybody we're out here what do another video straighten we got for today is blue haze and I picked this up from the nest of the week blue haze wonderful strain man 8020 indica dominant from what I found out teach that was gonna be about 25% and that's for the flower not to shatter I couldn't find thing for the shatter so but anyways 25 percent THC so kind of upper moderate moderate levels you know but it's still a wonderful strain genetics this is a cross between blueberry and super Silver Haze and that's the same genetics as pac-man blue dream blueberry cross the super Silver Haze same genetics but different effects I feel like this is a little bit more kouchi than platinum blue dream and if I had to choose between the two strains I would probably go with a platinum blue dream just because I do most of my medicating during a day time so I need to be kind of functional and uppity and this one is kind of a little bit more on the body you know it's a lot more mellow anyways a wonderful strain it's still like it's happy it's euphoric I like that so guy like stimulates cerebral high a nice grounding kind of like a body stone to it not sedating in any way because your mind is active this is great for stuff like sitting on the computer doing work on the computer video games you know music editing videos stuff like that it is kind of it is it feels wonderful I love it the only thing is that it does get kind of catchy and that's the only thing I met a kid with this the whole entire day like wake-and-bake or whipped like before I went to bed and for me I think this is probably best for like you're a 9 o'clock at night depending what time you go sleep anything like a good 2 maybe 3 hours before you're gonna go sleep this is a good strain to medicate with like come home shower or eat dinner get ready for watch your favorite show before bedtime talk this up before your shows you know it's sit down watch your shows have some fun because it is kind of focused you know it is kind of attentive and I thought I was thinking this might be good for a TD ADHD because it is mellow you know it settles the nerves calms you down chills you out wonderful for stress anxiety depression stuff like that also red is good for headaches as far as their stuff to make monkey but I out on there's some there's couch lock with this these I experience that it does get couch she does a crash small kind munchies is in their content mouth is pretty strong I found myself feel like I'm a drive around I'm from I don't was cracking like there's like that's how dry it was and it was like swelling I've had a hard time breathing I'm sure was all in my head but you know that that's how it tends it was you know I mean pilots my own my own thinking that made it worse you know but worse than it really was but still wonderful strain love medicating with this but I think I'd probably just keep this more for the evening like before bedtime stuff so anyhow yeah I don't know what else to say that it is a good strain I'll take a quick dab sure with the coffee like because there this thing does have some coffee man so gotta make sure because it is a cold morning matter on a freaking what kind of warm it up just a tad bit a little bit man just give it some kind of warmth I know I'm not doing is a cold freezing an article but still I'm kind of careful man ok how does it get to it get this party started all right here we go this is a great strain its stony it's hazy you know it's great it's good and house got some blue haze loaded up right here in the hole the taste is nice it's got a chemical kind of a taste to it like a cleaner of some time but also a little bit of earthy like a floor onus to it it's nice I like I enjoy my I'm medicated with it there's the cost and now I gotta go wonderful straining man blue haze it's some good stuff take it easy guys", "IBB1abU3tBo": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast we tour review today's special guest jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is another west coast week two review mail we're just keeping it real jazzasaurus j ping respect my region this is the west coast weed tour we are identifying the best products we appreciate you guys for

all things cannabis related such as trends products and having conversations with professionals in the industry so sit back relax and enjoy the show hello everybody and welcome back to the Lowe show for episode 3 I'm your host Robin and today we'll be reviewing three more strains all by the same company San Rafael 71 so getting started we're having the tangerine dream and right off the bat I was quite happy to be met with terpenes rushing my face I didn't have to put my nose into the jar I love being greeted with Terps and so this was very enjoyable really owns up to its name tangerine dream it smells like a candied tangerine absolutely visually the nugs are quite pop corny I can expect that throughout all the eighth's that are purchased just the nature of the genetics maybe if we purchase a quarter we'll get some bigger nugs the look of it is beautiful very nice green with rich Purple's and orange balance throughout this is definitely something that would capture well in photography for sure when it's rolled it has a really nice ash it burns darn near perfect the flavor isn't as consistent as as we're inhaling it as it is when we smell it but it is there we can definitely taste it the bigger draw you take the more likely you will taste it when I was finished smoking it my mouth kind of tasted a bit ashtray Lake but nothing a breath mint can't fix so the effect itself was very enjoyable I wouldn't call this a high potency strain as far as the THC is concerned but it's very noticeable the effect most definitely it has lots of potential I would say that the first 30 minutes of it were quite uplifting and inspiring but after that I felt that there was a bit of a lethargic kind of quick burnout to it of course that is my response others might feel differently about that I would say on the spectrum of value this definitely has some good value to it for sure the cost on it was $45 for the eighth and I would say for the legal market that is absolutely fair for what they're asking considering how it burned and how its looks and tastes that is has some value to it for sure and anybody who hasn't tried this before they can kind of assume what it might taste like if you enjoy tangerines so out of five I would give this one a three point five stars and I would be excited to try future batches absolutely already so moving forward we have the della Hayes by San Rafael 71 and I'm gonna sing its praises for a second I was really happy when I opened the jar and I was rushed with a bunch of terpenes to my face I feel as though the flavor profile really reminds me of a strain that was popular in the west coast called love potion so if anybody is hunting for that they could probably find something very similar at their local dispensary if there's have the della Hays stocked it was easy to roll good presence of resin most definitely and when it was rolled the ash was just fantastic it burns slowly it burned evenly I couldn't ask for much more the flavor was good right down to the very end the roach was just almost as tasty as the beginning of the experience the effect was very enjoyable it had me feeling uplifted happy to do some chores yeah definitely a good mood type of effect here and of course that's pertaining to my experience I would hope the same for anybody else as far as the overall quality I would have to rate this a 3.5 stars this was a $45 ate and compared to the general market legal of market of legal cannabis here in Canada I would say this has a lot of value to it and it's something that I recommend to friends and family most definitely all righty so moving forward we have one of my favorites that I've tried so far and that is the pink kush by san rafael 71 now as we can see here the blood structure is very pop corny in fact kind of beat up a little bit but shining through that we have a nice rich earthy kind of a bit piney tiny bit gassy smell and I didn't have to bring my nose to the jar it came to me so of course I appreciate that I can just see that it has some good resin content to it I assumed in with a camera I couldn't see any developed gland heads so you know they have some work to go as far as the overall quality of the THC but when it's smoked it's delicious it burns slowly the ash is very consistent gray and halfway through the joint I could tell that I was actually getting pretty stoned so this is the first time I'm gonna rate something strong I think this is appropriate for the advanced consumer a person who has a high tolerance for THC if you were a novice I would just consider taking a very small amount at once and you might notice that you quite enjoy it so generally for the the value of a 48.8 in today's regulated market I think that this definitely comes to the party and brings its strength really that's the the number one opinion that I have about this is that it's good tasting its strong for an advanced consumer such as myself and I just look forward to future batches when the bud structure is a bit more full and a bit less pop Corning and bottom backs overall I would give this one four out of five stars and so that concludes our third episode of the lo show thank you so much for watching and never forget that here we like to review flowers and this is all based on my personal opinion it has no bearing in actual fact of course but

now [Music] oh [Music] you", "G9QOKr611Yw": "hi and welcome to this approach up tutorial in this tutorial going to create a dream haze effect so we start with quite a clean porch right here and it is fairly crisps and nice details and we're going to move it in too much of a dreamlike feel to it so at the moment the background is is locked so we're just going to click on that lock to to unlock it and make it a little more flexible later on and the lighting in this image is coming from the top right so it's going to work better with images that have got a light source from the side we're going to add some more lighting effects we're gonna go to filter render and lighting effects using the infinite setting and you can you can play around the other settings but we're going to keep it simple for this stage of the tutorial and just grabbing the handle there just repositioning and you can see here that the lighting is still coming from the top right so really we just increasing intensity of that lighting effect then clicking ok they're going to duplicate that layer and we're going to add a blur effect so go to filter blur now we go to gallium blur so it goes in by is quite strong effects you can you can adjust it to shoot we're aiming to really remove most of the details and just maintain just their kind of a very light awareness of the form there so we're going to click OK and change the blend mode to soft light so you can see already that's created a softening effect then going to duplicate that layer once again but this time going to change the blend mode to screen so in the river a few different layer at layers of soft new effects I'm actually drop your pasty of that top on down a little bit so it's not quite as strong ok so that's some nice of softening of the image then we're going to add a lens flare so filter render and lens flare so few different choices and we're going to go for using the 50 to 300 millimeter and you can play around with the brightness and you see what kind of effects you can achieve with what you're producing it's going to hit okay so you can play around with this eco get a stronger or lighter effects there's quite lighten in this particular image that you can play around look for yourselves then we're going to make a new blank layer and on this blank layer we're going to add a series of white spots so using the brush using making sure the hardness is all the way down as well I'm going to add a series of white spots not black so check your foreground swatches on white using the square bracket on the keyboard you better quite quickly change the size of your your brush now aiming to really get a good spread of dots so we'll differentiate all different sizes there's some small some large so you can add as many as you feel girls oops so you can experiment with that one once you've got the spots on there and they go to filter and we're going to go to blur once again and we're going to use a radial blur so spin is going to be about between 15 and 20 make sure you put on best quality and that's going to add quite nice little touch in the background there then we can add another blank layer and this right now we're going to use the gradient tool so if you make sure you've got the black to white gradient set and then clicking out double clicking on the swatch of the top and we're going to click on the bottom left black swatch here and I'm going to change to a colorful choice so in this case I'm going to go from blue we go and very simply click drag and drop and I'm keeping the white coming from the beside of the light source is so you plan our that until you get the desired effect there we go and we're going to go to change the blend mode again so unix peril of these but in my case I go fullscreen going to drop your pasty love it as well as the effect isn't quite as strong so there we go if we have a look at lees before and after so we start with quite a clean crisp papaya image and we've added some nice kind of softening effects and some some spiral effects in the background there and some colors as well the anything you could do to really finish off a busy add some level adjustments and with those levels you kids just kind of add those finishing touches hope you enjoyed and have fun we've got own edits thank you", "kN82QzN1F6w": "what up YouTube another day in the grow tents filling up I unless Tetum down just this one more top might have to do them to get to can to pee down but I got them second day on 12:12 white cycle so they spend two nights doing nut it's still hot flower today it'll be the third night of them on the twelve clothes it's looking good in here but if these are photo periods and not autos like they're supposed to be I'm gonna get a straw mat and put it in here and start doing a screen and dream so these but when they start bud and they'll be able to support themselves or the sprout and that'll help support them I should say they blog two nights tops yes I do that then I might have to defoliate a little in the bottom so those take it a day at a time otherwise she's looking good but the fan and and I might have to take this out though if I put a Skog that up yeah maybe it'll fit between a couple of them sit between the net when I was I'm sure I'll work it out and it's been good he made it he's been good extra maybe go for a little better light so far this one seems to be doing okay they probably use more late just to get more coverage [Applause] yeah I tagged this man cooling down there to just even hope the can to be a little more to do from here can't wait till these babies start flowing [Applause] but that's it for today guys girls and don't forget to like subscribe hit the little battle thing let you know when I post a new video and hopefully next time I show you these babies they're getting some flower tops but alright thanks for watching everybody and kidding [Applause]", "iMnR3LjFUFs": "what's going on guys and welcome back to my fish tank vlog behind me you can see the new racking system it's looking great one side we've got shrimp at the moment and some killifish and some nano fish as well and the other side we just got some plants being stored but not forever because that would be a very expensive plant rack wouldn't it yes a quick little recap for those of you that aren't aware so in here i've got this amazing pair of killifish if it focuses which it has there you go look at that stunners absolute stunners male and female oh no the lights have gone off well that won't do i have to get them back on hang on and we're back in action so yeah we've got the liar tails and i couldn't pronounce them before but you guys said that's how it's pronounced so if it's wrong sorry liar tails in that one crystal red shrimp in this one next to it they are doing great not seen any babies yet but tons of malts going on melts are the shells that surround their body when they grow out of them they just pop them off and then they do it again until they're massive like this one here the goliath right in the middle there what a beast anyway so i haven't actually fed these guys specialist food yet because i'm waiting for some to come in but it's now arrived so let's get it in this little tray thing this guy's gonna have to come out because otherwise you're gonna get it full on your head so when i was at aquarium gardens i've got this denali shrimp king stuff i don't know if it's any good or not but it had five in one so it's got all like different kinds of things like minerals proteins complete leaf mix and snow pops whatever that is anyway i'm gonna put one of each in that little tray feeding tray and then just see what they like whoa whoa whoa what is this wizardry look at this snow pops thing it's like growing i guess that's why it pops it's getting massive never seen that before looks pretty cool i hope they like it well look the shrimp are straight on it so that's a really good sign that's the first food i put in where the shrimp would jump straight on so nice one denile i mean no my shrimp though i'll come back tomorrow morning and none of this food will be in the bowl it'll be scattered about the place or maybe it'll all be eaten i mean that'd be even even better you know i'm looking to breed these shrimp and it's important to get quality food into them because you know they are what they ate same with all of us really isn't it so hopefully this stuff's really good now currently they are the only shrimp that i've got apart from a few amano's that i've got in this one so i have got some new blue bolt or blue dream shrimp what's the difference blue bolt bluetooth anyway i've got some cool blue neocaridina shrimp that i want to put in this one and here they are over by the sink in this pot look um i took them out of the bag because i picked them up earlier on this morning didn't want to keep them in the bag so i've just put them in here with some nice clean water that looks kind of hazy but it's not so i can put this straight in i've got 10 10 blues there and a couple of babies as well which is nice i just need to drip acclimate them for a little bit to make sure that like the the water parameters are the same temperature wires are already good but you know that water is probably very different to what the stuff that i got in a different county it's the county next to me from where i got them so from where i got them i don't know what that means anyway drip hack for me click subscribe [Music] so they're all drip acclimating fine i've just looked over oh my goodness the shrimp are loving this is it attracted every single one no there's one little guy i can see back there still come on son get involved get into the party these guys look they're loving it oh that's awesome really really good nice big feed and surely this is gonna bring on some like breeding action get some eggs and everything but definitely got male and female mixes in here like that one not that one in the front the one just next to it behind that's definitely a male so you see how the way it's got that sort of curved back to it that curves downwards the one the front that's got that little bubbly roundedness to the bottom so the that's how you distinguish between the males and females but these these these shrimp are gorgeous absolutely love them i mean they are my favorite as well like you can get tons of oh no the one that i have seen that looks amazing is the blue ones that have got orange eyes i mean that's crazy i gotta get hold of those some of those at some point so my original plan was to scape all of the shrimp tanks you can see behind me but i'm having so much fun just collecting them and seeing you know the behavior learning more about them that i'm just going to keep them as they are as like a few plants and a little bit of substrate which is the tropical aqua soil i'm just going to keep it as it is for now and just just watch them and learn and try and get them breeding and get those numbers up those numbers up those are rookie numbers in this racket i just really enjoy that part i've got so many tanks i've aquascaped here and i'm actually going to be escaping all six of these ones for nanofish so and for the killifish as well getting way more involved in the killifish you guys love those you love that video i love them i've actually ordered more i've just gotta wait for them to arrive as well no prizes for guessing the ones i ordered i told you in the last killifish video it was my favorite ones i found them i've got them they're on their way not cheap either actually the fish were cheap but the shipping was like way more expensive than the fish but that's all right that's that's what you've got to do in there if you want to get specialist fish you've got to order them online it's just there's no way around it i've tried finding them in the stores pretty local to me within like an hour's distance but there doesn't seem to be any so ordering online only option some of you guys in the comments have said good things about ordering online so that's great as well well the shrimp have now been acclimated for 40 minutes in fact i'd actually forgotten about i was away editing but look it's all fine it's all good so we can now put them into their new home [Music] haha yes well they're in but it's difficult to see on this substrate i'm going to be taking this clam out by the way guys it's absolutely fine it keeps opening and closing and it's actually travelled from this spot here all the way across there so they're still alive and well i didn't actually know they moved so that's pretty cool but i'm going to be moving it into a bigger tank it's not standing here in fact i'll do that in just a second but i think i'm going to give these guys some food because these guys over here the crystals are still going absolutely nuts all of that food so i'm going to put some in here as well now there's not as many shrimp so i'll just put half the amount and also i haven't got a tray which is normal and will not trade you know a dish a feeding dish i'm going to order a few more definitely well i've got six tanks here so i need six dishes don't i [Music] well i was gonna say hopefully we'll come back in a minute and there'll be shrimp on these but there's already one on there straight away but i'd like to see all 10 on there as soon as possible i think i probably fed way too much there but you know any extras that are not eaten in the next sort of like hour or so whilst i'm here at the studio i can just suck out with a um a turkey baster so it doesn't go like foul and it doesn't cause any ammonia spikes in the water because you don't want that at all uneaten food will cause they're sensitive things these shrimp so you don't want ammonia spikes at all and the award for the most obvious thing to say goes to me of course you don't want ammonia in your tank killifish update guys the liar tails are actually doing really really well they're always coming out well they're all doing well don't get me wrong but the live tiles are brilliant because they're always out they're always at the front just fed them look you can see all that food on the surface just a little pinch look there's only two fish in there remember so you don't need like loads and loads but yeah these are brilliant they're so fun and uh this one here this male particularly he he just comes to greet me whenever i come in the room which is quite nice i wish the other ones would do the same so moving down in this one we've got the volcanoes now the female you can see there look she is always coming out which is brilliant we get to see her quite a lot the male sits right at the back there i don't know if i'm picking him up at all but he sits right in the back no i'm not picking him up where is he well now i don't even know where the mail's gone but he was here two seconds ago because i checked where they were before putting some more food in for them but the fact that she's come out because she was hiding as well so she knows that there's food in the water so that's brilliant side we need them to get eaten don't we obviously well hello though you're very friendly aren't you oh that's good to know look she she eats from the bottom which is good i was a little bit worried that if they didn't get the food it was falling that they wouldn't eat but that's not the case look i've seen her eating off the bottom and i've seen others as well the other ones at the top see there you go she grabbed that one nice spit spits it straight out very ungrateful it's not free you know you have to pay for this stop spitting it out and over to the splendid well he's just in the same spot as when i first got him well that's fine you know he's cool it does come out cause i've come in the room and he darts back that is his little cave in the back there am i making him out i think i am right next to where that sort of white ceramic bit is on the uh plant there he just sits there this is my home i like my home i'm safe i'm safe here and oh hello mr snail you're you're loving the the home though you're exploring that's good that's what we want to see some exploration of the tanks many of you noticed in the last video as well this plant right here the blitzy shiponika hanging on by one little piece of root well it's starting to root more now i mean i could replant it but it's quite fun watching the roots come to where it's not it's like watching roots grow what am i talking about [Music] now since i started making this video i actually rescaped one of the shrimp tanks the crystal reds you would have seen that probably in the build video on saturday if you haven't go look at my channel page with the list of video yeah just click click something somewhere that's not great salesman channel is it but anyway who cares they've been set up for three days now let's have a look how they're getting on hey look at this swimmer yeah doing really good oh let me turn the light off it might stop that stuff in the background is that better yeah i think that's better okay so a few of you were concerned you were saying about this uh what's it called sponge filter uh the fact that it's so close to the surface means it's gonna be less efficient well i mean the water's crystal clear and it's clearly sucking stuff in because it's already got like a haze on it and you know i think to be fair it's efficient enough for what we need for this size tank it's just you could probably go filterless with this and still do really well if you kept up on your water changes you certainly could with the other tanks because they got loads and loads of stem plants in and stem plants as we know suck out nutrients from the water column but to the shrimp so they've eaten everything that was in their little dish which is good i did take some out because it was massively full the last time i fed them i'm kind of learning as i go along how much to feed them and basically those little sticks you put in you probably just need one tiny bit broken off for the amount of shrimp i've got in here at the moment and they will just munch through that in no time so already you can see that the hydrocarbon japan which is this sort of clovery looking leaf that has already started to straighten up and start to grow upwards now some people can be like oh don't put that in your tank it's very invasive and it just grows everywhere good that's what i want you can just trim it back so easily like you can just pull one bit and it pulls the rest up so it's easy to actually look out for but i'm really looking forward to the blix of japonica in the middle there that will thicken up and get huge just like we're seeing in this tank now this is the ember tetra one and many of you seen this as well see this see the blix of japonic at the back there see how it's just doing the nice wispiness that was a tiny little plant when i put that in um and now it's like that so these are actually already a half decent size they're gonna be massive in no time i'm gonna have to keep up on the maintenance of this tank or it will just turn into a messy jungle that's the thing with the stuff with a tank like this that's like kind of wild looking it can get out of control fast so i'm not one who's been great at keeping up on maintenance in terms of trimming and things so for this one i'm gonna make sure i do betty betty where are you i don't see betty everyone where's betty you know betty the biggest one the absolute beast the monster crystal red shrimp must be at the back i mean to be fair those ones over there on the filter they they're pretty decent size betty where are you actually probably hiding so i'm actually expecting another shipment of shrimp to arrive this week and i'm hoping to come in that shipment because sometimes you don't get what you ask for just a load of the standard cherry shrimp now i want to start breeding them in obviously these aquariums but when i start getting bigger numbers i'm going to move them across and just populate all aquariums because shrimp are amazing at cleaning your tank especially breeding shrimp now amano shrimp are the king of cleaners when it comes to shrimp but they don't breed in fresh water you have to have sort of brackish water and even then it's only been done by a few i'd love to have a go at it someday but at the moment i've got loads of other things going on many of you have actually asked me to do it but i just don't have the time at the moment not with these projects and they've got some big projects coming as well but cherry shrimp on the other hand they breed in fresh water and they breed a lot the numbers tend to be exponential in terms of growth so like you'll start off with with a good amount to start off with is about 20. that starts the colony you're gonna have good females good males and before you know it you're sort of putting babies across to other tanks and they're starting their own car cherry shrimp are brilliant i did have a lot going in a few tanks in my very first shed but when i had to break down all the tanks to move into the newer studio not this one the second studio this is the fourth studio now wow this is happening fast yeah i lost a lot of the shrimp because they don't again they're not like massive parameter changes so if you just like drain a load of the tank water and fill it up again it's very difficult you do tend to get a lot of dark i didn't get the dark straight away but it happened over time and before you know it yeah the numbers dwindle but i want to give it a go again and get back onto it but that is it for this one guys if

update you guys let you know what's going on so we are in the 4000 watt blue dream flower room just to recap we've got 24 plants in here four rows of six twenty of the plants are blue dream and then the four plants in the back there are fire oh gee we're at day 14 I didn't make an update for day seven because there's enough day 7 update videos on my channel and they're kind of all boring because there's nothing happening but you can see the plants have grown quite a bit since day one of flower however I did hit them with bushmaster to try and keep them from stretching a lot because I know blue dream really likes to stretch and fire OG stretches like crazy and you can see that they are on average a foot taller than any of the blue dreams back there that strain stretches like [ __ ] crazy guys like more than any strain by far more than any string I've ever grown like to internode spacings like 5 to 6 inches but you get these rock-hard golf ball-sized nugs like OG nugs are so nice but yes we have the 4 or 5 OG in the back there that are over the tops of between no cages and then all the blue dreams that are not even close to the top bring the spindle cages they really are not stretching and in fact my my little runt there is tiny it's like maybe 30 inches tall at most you know it's it's almost to the 2nd a second ring from the top so it's really small but these plants are really bushy and I haven't been tucking them really I just been letting them grow out through this beam ok just because I do want the canopy to fill out and it looks like it's going to come really close to filling out as far as the health of the plants goes they are all very healthy the fire OGS are just nice dark luscious dark green beautiful plants the blue dreams are a little light green they're more like a lime green and the ones directly under the lights are even a little lighter than the ones that aren't I would not say that they have a yellow tint to them whatsoever they're just light green at this point and I do have super spreaders that I will be throwing in the lights probably tomorrow so that will help with any light bleaching that may occur in this grow another thing I'm considering is moving these plants I don't like to move plants once they're in flower and never deal I mean it's extremely rare circumstance that I would do that something really bad would have to happen and in this case something bad as far as I'm concerned has happened a friend of mine that doesn't know I have this garden in my house he was arrested last week I think it was before days before days seven in this garden anyway he was arrested first just some stupid stuff and my phone number as like a contact or an emergency contact or something so I got a County from her a call from the county in jail asking about him and they wanted to confirm his address and I told them where he lived in like oh well that's not what he said is address wasn't like well what'd you say his address was and they're like oh this address and they actually read off my address for this growers apparently he didn't want them to know where he lived so he gave them my address as his address and as some of you may know if there's any problem with you not with you not showing up to court or anything like that they will come to your house and look for you and the last place or the last people I want visiting my are the police although this is the only garden I have in this house and it's only 24 plants and I have you know my authorizations to cover the numbers and everything's totally legal on the state level I just don't want any cops coming around here and having any chance that they smell any marijuana or anything like that so haven't for sure decided to do this but I may move these plants to another garden and just kind of fill them in add another garden but haven't decided for sure I may leave him here another percent sure probably within the next week I'll know or figure out whether or not I want to do that I just I can't risk you know cops showing up and coming in giving me a bunch of [ __ ] for having marijuana plants in here so I yeah that's just you know one thing I'm dealing with not like I'm really dealing with anything in life I mean things are pretty good it's just just that one one issue that makes me kind of want to move these plants and I have space for them somewhere else so I can move them but just haven't quite decided anyway I haven't been watering these plants very much you know right the first I think right around day one a flower I gave him I think one point nine EC of nutrients which is a really strong feeding and they took it just fine and then backed off my next feeding was like 1.5 and then the most recent feeding was only like one point one or one point zero you see so really easy on the nutrients and they have not been taking up much water unfortunately I would hope that by now you know they're going through almost a gallon a day or you know three liters a day at least but they're not I mean they're hardly getting much water at all I did see some route Athens in this garden I thought I had you know no Rudy if it's anywhere and honestly besides this garden I'm almost 100% positive I have no Rudy has any work but I did see some around here and I think they developed after day one of flower because when I watered it they want a flower they didn't need any water for like five or six days and I was gonna put some like as max root Drent some as max in with the watering to help you know give those Rudy if it's a hard time but those five days I didn't do it for the first first watering so then it was like five days before I put some in there and by then like the Rudy a food population was pretty strong it's not strong enough to where like I need to put traps out or anything but like I see one flying around here there and I think that they are having something to do with the plants not taking up a lot of water song in it continue to give him some as Max when I wanted them for the next few times and I hopefully put a damper on the Rue de fer population as far as the fire OG go they hardly get any water they take up probably a third to a half the amount of out of the blue dream deal I mean I rarely ever water them and that's just a nature the strain it does not use a lot of water out I'd say out of every strain I've ever grown the fire oh geez just like need water maybe once a week at most and probably once we're in like week five or six of flower when they're taking up more water than any other point in their lives still like maybe a couple gallons a week at most what they're gonna take up I mean you can see a lot of these plants like three days ago and it's still totally wet on top of these fire oh geez where's the blue dreams they're they're due for water like I'll probably water them tomorrow but yeah so that's the story what's going on with here right now you can see the height difference there's the blue dreams and there's the fires the fires are a lot taller what a beautiful stream though I don't have any more of these this is my last four I was gonna flower him out and then not grow the screen anymore and you know in my 4k multi strain room last round where I had some fire in there I think I had two or three fire yeah three fire like I was gonna do the same thing with you're just so beautiful and the buds buds so nice and so I mean I suck the lollipop those actually lollipop this one but all all they pop the rest like tomorrow and see that these down low maybe I'll take a couple clones I don't know and keep it around I just got so many strains to deal with anyway guys I'm just rambling on we're at nine minutes already so I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video and I'll give you another update next Monday it'll be day 21 and it'll either be in here or another garden I don't know for sure but I'll let you know what's going on alright peace", "0zVULqbqysQ": "hey guys it's Alex from beyond statistics back once again for another hookah review today i'm going to be reviewing blazing blue by hayes tobacco this was given to us courtesy of dream tobacco and I'm California look it up brookhurst involve leona hookah lounge so you know they know their stuff they're very knowledgeable people and the place is packed a great place to go to smoke when I'm up don't feel like setting up my hookah just draw it over there great so anyway let's get on to the flavor looking at the flavor and it looks like spinach or if you've ever had a Mexican dirt weed it's very similar it's a dark green kind of a teal blue hints look it's green dude let's smell it smelling it I detect a little bit of fruit but a lot of kind of like a winter fresh we're like a menthol winter fresh and the slight hints of fruit at the end smells decent I don't know how it will smoke let's find out it's nice and smooth flavor is great it's a very mellow Smoke it's pretty light compared to how it smells it smells very deep but it smokes a pretty deep flavor the taste is almost like a if you ever chewed a blue flavored gum ball I don't know if the flavor is it's just blue flavored like after you've been chewing it for a while you can definitely taste like a even check the blue gumbo for a while it's pretty great flavor i'll definitely be picking up more of this when i run out thanks again to dream tobacco for giving us this flavor it's been great reviewing it if i was going to give it buddy's going to rate it on a scale from one to ten I could probably give it a nine to ten maybe nine and a half solid nine and a half shirt I'm wearing and check us out at beyond stats clothing bigcartel com thanks for watching review if you want to catch more from us in the future hit subscribe we'll be doing a lot more where else printing a lot more shirts for summers check us out thanks for watching", "_PoeJ5xOhMI": "hey that's us Rochelle I'm here to do another eg slimed review this time we're going to be taking a look at three more flavors from vape milk actually originally reviewed this line but eight months ago is one of my first line reviews so it's neat that I'm kind of circling back around almost a year later and we're going to try three flavors today out of the ten and I'll have three more coming up and a part two but I've already tried four of them so I wanted to share pretty um these are pretty much up from the new set of flavors they put out so first one we're gonna go ahead and try is called Blue Dream Blue Dream oh my gosh Blue Dream is a scar to be a blueberry glazed donut and all kind of like what you get with this it's gonna be like a milk line smells really really good definitely a fresh tart blueberries what I'm getting right off the scent of it we're gonna be testing this out on my unholy RDA and 0.25 build at 60 watts on top of my limitless arms-race mod if you guys haven't seen my thoughts on this that video will be linked at the end for you guys to check out but let's go ahead and give it a rip and all that you guys know I'm tasting definitely more like a blueberry scone to me it's got it's not as sweet as you would think for a blueberry doughnut definitely nice bakery note they're not overly sweet not overpowering on the blueberry so it doesn't have a you know a perfume a flora note to it it tastes really really good definitely I can see something in it as in a take I'm getting that sugar lip now I'm actually really really liking it I definitely can see where they talk about a blueberry glazed donut and I'm I really like it so yeah I'm rambling now and so we just need to move on so I'm a driver in this cotton off we're gonna move on to our next flavor all right we got kids outside dogs barking the whole nine yards this is real life people so I apologize if you hear the noise in the background the next try it's called Sin City this is a cinnamon roll in a nice cold glass of milk I am always wary of cinnamons because I'm scared they'll be overpowering overpowering cinnamons tend to give me a headache but this has actually a caramel caramelized note to it which is interesting so I can't wait to try this one alright let's give it a rip and all you guys know what I'm tasting definitely almost like those pill but Pillsbury cinnamon roll donut cinnamon rolls that tastes more like a doughnut than it does a cinnamon roll because it's not overpowering we're really really good smooth on the inhale smooth on the exhale great cloth production this is definitely gonna be one for someone who loves their Bakery notes is very very mild in regards to its not in-your-face so that means you can vape it all day and not get sick of it this one definitely gets two thumbs up for me so I'm gonna go ahead and Ryan Brothers cutting off and we're gonna move on to our last waver alright now that I got a completely fogged out in my living room we're gonna go ahead and move on to our last flavor and our last flavor is milk and honey one thing I did not disclose about this in the beginning is that vape milk is completely budget-friendly you're looking at twenty two and ninety nine for a 120 if you use a link below and sign up for their newsletter you actually save 15% off your first order but even then even without a discount 22 99 is a steal especially if you're vapor on a budget so we're going to go ahead and try out milk and honey I'm assuming it's exactly what it says which is a milk and honey weight gorgeous color to it hmm that's interesting definitely has a honey note to it but I almost smell like a I don't know like a Frappuccino type smell to it so let's go ahead and give this go and let you guys know I'm tasting it reminds me of those little honey candies that I had when I was younger it's really good I mean you get the sweetness of the honey it is a honey and you do get a creamy note to it now the only thing I'm tasting in here that may distract some other people is that that honey is gonna actually overpower anything you have left on your cotton so I will let you guys know somewhere around here after vaping this for the rest of the day what it does to my cotton and coils but I really love the flavor that's coming off of this and I definitely give it two thumbs up so not disappointed with all three flavors whatsoever for me the blueberry is the one that I wish is just a little bit sweeter but still very very good and the value is there and you get a lot of juice for the price point so hope you guys liked this quick review if you did please give it a thumbs up leave any questions or comments you have down below and as always I hope you're having an amazing day or night whenever you're watching this stay tuned to the next video and until then vape on [Music]",

guys today is december 26th and uh super lemon hayes got her week seven feet today and uh ph water at 6.5 blue dream is exploding it's getting pretty damn big she's still at a ppm of 500 and uh ph i've been keeping it 5.8 and i just did the rose change today let me take in there and i'll show you what this looks like that's the super lemony's mother she's had nothing but big bloom i haven't had the water up since she looks very very nice nice structuring i actually wanted this bottom to try to keep up but it looks like i'm probably going to end up having to bend that top down because all she really wants to do was just spit her arms out like a damn christmas tree but looking good though nice nice color to it and that is the blue dream i'm not getting a couple of tiger leafs on this really i don't know what causes that i couldn't really tell you i think maybe just like a chunk of salt or something in the nutrient solution or something burn the root but i mean overall this plant is like it's loving life it is loving everything i keep doing this thing these leaves over here are messed up because that's back when i thinned it when i dyed her all down she cut probably about 50 50 plus branches on it but i did notice that uh when i mixed the water up i think it was last week i wanted to see if this was a calcium you know hungry plant so i mixed the ppm's of calmag boxes cali magic at 200 ppms and fed it to her and i ended up noticing like a day later that it was getting a calcium deficiency so i know that it really likes at least 250 for right now and i'll up it if if i notice any more but i had already fixed the problem i'll show you guys what a calcium deficiency looks like you see those those brown spots right there those brown spots are calcium spot right here as you can tell like new growth there there isn't any in the new growth at all they're looking really really nice beautiful lush green color but just a a tip for you guys if you end up getting that browning that brown dots like if it even starts off like like that right there then you know it's calcium well yeah overall beautiful beautiful plant beautiful plant definitely 50 plus branches on there i had already picked the tops on her she should explode with another probably 100 on it i still got three weeks left on super lemon haze so this has three weeks left in the bucket but i did end up actually ordering um advanced nutrients ph perfect because if i have to leave for i don't know like six or seven hours out of the day and i'm not in here check the ph it could drift up i don't want to drift up past you know [ __ ] six six three i don't even want it to hit that so and that's what it's been doing lately is it's been drifting the ph up but not really too bad i'm assuming just because it's it's sucking up so much of the nutrients that it's actually changing the ph but not really a big deal looking looking awesome looking really good i have high expectations for that plant let me take you to the flowering room you guys a good idea what i'm working with with this i'll give you guys a shot of it like this with put the camera on yellow light and then i'll turn it off and get back on that blue lighting you guys can actually see what it looks like i'm gonna try to get some up close pictures she's getting a lot of frosting a good structure a big huge nugget yeah the trichomes are just bursting out of it now still getting some brown under the hair right there is a huge button and just to give you an idea on how big that is that's that's my hand some fat bugs put my hand in there it is hard to justify the size of the buds on the camera but they're good size good size buds all right give me a second i'll switch the camera lighting over there we go i can see she's eating her sugar leaves up really good that's exactly what i like all my medicine to do suck up all that sugar i can she got pretty heavy feeding tonight as you can see the most of the hairs are still white on this plant and the buds are just magnificent looking give you guys some shots what it looks like underneath you got some spots where you can see through or but if you remember me telling you in the beginning of the super lemonade season that i was going to pick and choose which branch and i wanted to have butt on it so that's exactly what i got man i'm shaking it's so hard to kneel down down here but hell yeah lots and lots of branches she's reaching really long i was excited to do the video for you guys tonight just because the buds have actually gone a lot longer oh yeah so the subscriber update right now i think i have 248 and again as soon as i hit 300 there's going to be a lucky person that's going to be able to grow the alien dog in train wreck mix i'll probably end up sending them like five seeds because i know that the seeds are hard to crack so giving me five chances one of them is bound to open up all right you guys there's your update and thank you for watching you guys have a good one you", "f44VciXIiYA": "what's up y'all subway farmer dupe top hat mix checking out the ladies on date 50th flower all flushed up I ready to go god I feel like another week and a half two weeks tops really nice I've been checking the triphthongs this ambery it's a lot of hammering a lot of milking is I thought he knows it's crazy because at that point I was not when he cut them but my plan is telling me it's not ready itself only from individual you know microscopic level was saying it is but I'm looking at it as too many white hair so tell you know there's too many white hairs all over both plants so it's like I don't know what do i do do i harvest half the plant there's something I don't know but I shake watch that with me oh sandy most of it was about the same weird to me I never wrote I was rid of strange for easy I don't know if anybody know anything about that let me know right from from the microscopic look at the trifles you know it's a little bit it is it's not even amber and cloudiness you know I'll harvest it at this time basically based on the Cyclones porosity but as I'm looking at the planet so it's a lot of white there's a chop have anybody ever grew this fine blue haze I know it's like a nine weeks time and I said I got like a we could have two weeks maybe should've changed maybe change I mean better looks good everything look good I'm just saying FAR's I mean looking at charcoals and visually looking at it with my eyes ready I know it's not ready to in the Santa wider strike foam so it'll be like super duper [ __ ] ambarish I don't really want that you know I don't want to harvest it when it's not ready or so again some night shots I'm asked for us [Music] you", "Ib9Ehei_ke8": "all right here we are his show hops a new product from killer wax with a click off company we're gonna show off this new Blue Dream which art has just come up with and I really like it because it's hybrid wax it's got lots more polymer than it does waxes which needs a brilliant shine for show cars or regular driver cars now I compare this to the gold and the gold pretty much is a better wax than this but it's a high-dollar wax I only use that to make money with and it's not even on my car so the goal is of a much better wax but this blue dream pretty much wobbles it like I said has lots of more pollen beers in it then I like better shine better depth on some of the other waxes and even the regular paste wax oxo is an excellent wax too so what I'm gonna do is use my car as a guinea pig here now I've already prepped my car with doing paint correction compound all the scratches out you guys know this car this car I probably put $10,000 with a paint reduction into a $4,000 car so you know where I'm coming from it's personal ride I'm also going to using that new applicators and they're they're from the clay cloth company try them out on this what I did is I dampened the applicator take it and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna saturate both ends since they really don't fit in there but we're gonna get in here anyway we're gonna go and try out this now what I have to do is I like to go in straight lines put some more product on here go on straight lines now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do half the door so the Machine what kind of better shine it leaves since my car has had lots of high-dollar sealants and waxes on here already this I've done the fender already but we're gonna see the difference what the door and what I haven't done just spread on there nice and easy I like these applicators they're great you can use the little round orange ones that are cheaper but I like these and I just do a nice straight line on there now the good thing about this stuff is and I'm gonna really let it let it down totally dry up I'm gonna let this haze a little bit but knowing the difference between this part and this part under artificial light now I'm going to explain something to you a lot of guys have the cars in daylight now the daylight is fine but artificial light at nighttime know if you ever gone to a gas station in the UK but you'll notice a lot of your imperfections in your pain under artificial light the fluorescent or right now I'm using the halogens and using LEDs so shows a lot of everything that's did I do to the paint you know what needs to be done if there's any imperfections it usually picks it right up daylight pretty much hides all that so for me to get to you know performance out of anything I usually do things under the artificial light then take them out and the light to check them out if there's any hazing or anything I missed usually these lights will actually pick up everything it's just a good habit to do you can pick up lights anywhere nighttime is always the best time for me to check out cars anyway so anyway we're letting this haze up just a little bit I'm gonna take my microfiber towel we're going to split it into fours eglish towel we're gonna start wiping this off now some people like to do straight lines you can do whatever you want but I know when you want to finish you wanna end up with straight lines so this is called paneling now when you panel out you can do whatever you want you want to swirl it that's fine but your last cleanup should be straight lines slip my towel over use a nice clean side it's nice and smooth it's not all greasy usually this is pretty therapeutic for me just to kind of relax take your time do one thing all the time I don't like doing this because sometimes we leave lines in the cars I see a lot of demonstrations done with this I'm just doing the see if there's a sign affective difference and I try to stay off of the Pinstripe page because sometimes they actually more up with wax these coatings not sometimes I'll just tape them off all the camera so anyway now we've got this all off in here let's see if we have a difference I think there's a little bit yeah there's a lot of difference anyway it leaves a nice shine I love it probably do the rest the car with it so anyway that was my demonstration just wanted to show you some things onto this and get some today that's killer wax blue dream we'll see you next time bye", "7dm2SWsuy2A": "hey guys this is anthony morgante i am mr photographer.com it is my opinion that luminar ai is the landscape photographer's dream now i know a lot of portrait photographers love luminar ai because it has a lot of great portrait tools and really the processing engine in luminar ai is very versatile you could be shooting macros or in studio studio product photography or shooting wildlife photography travel photography it really doesn't matter the processing engine in luminar ai can handle it but in my opinion as far as landscape photography goes the processing engine in luminar ai is the best available it does a great job and today we're just going to demonstrate it i'm just going to process this simple landscape image there's nothing special about it it was shot with the fujifilm xt4 and those of you that are fujifilm shooters know that raw files from the fujifilm x-trans sensors are sometimes a bit difficult to process in some applications you'll see that luminar ai has no problem whatsoever processing this image now when you first open up a raw file in the edit module of luminar ai it's automatically going to have the enhanced tool open the enhanced tool consists of two sliders accent ai and sky enhancer ai these are super powerful sliders and as the iai suggests uses artificial intelligence to process an image so if you move the x and a i slider to the right you can see how it's really processing the entire image it's adjusting the the white point the black point shadows highlights uh vibrance saturation contrast the whole nine yards with just one slider and at this point you could say well i'm done that's the way i like it this is the way i like it processed or maybe you want the sky more like significant or dramatic you can move the sky enhancer slider to the right you can see how it only affects the sky so you could come in and just adjust those two sliders and call it a day or maybe just adjust them slightly and then come in and get a finer tune adjustment for light and color using some of the other tools down below for this demonstration i'm not going to use these at all just to show you some of the other things you could do without using these ai tools necessarily we may use an ai tool down further but not these two iai tools at least so we'll close up the enhanced tool i like how i captured it in camera so i'm not going to crop it so i wouldn't do that there's no sensor spots or anything on the image that i need to erase so we'll skip that but we'll go right to light then this is where we're going to adjust the tone of the image now typically when i look at an image what i do is what stands out the most now for this specific scene i um exposed it for the sky so the uh ground area the mounds the hills the grass that's pretty dark and that stands out to me so i'll go to the shadows slider and i'll open up the shadows right away then i'll come in and i'll rain in the highlights a little bit i like to try to get a little more detail in the like finer parts of the clouds so i kind of just look in there i usually won't zoom in or anything like that i'll just come in and eyeball it like this and try to get a little more detail then what i'll do is after i move those two sliders i'll go to the whites and blacks or as they have it listed here blacks and whites open that up and what i can do is i could hit the j key on my keyboard to turn on the clipping indicators and you can see when i turn white's way up i get red on the screen that's indicating that i'm clipping the highlights if you were clipping highlights that means there's no detail you're wiping out any detail that was in those highlights so usually what i like to do is just back it off till all that red dissipates so then i'm assured that every highlight in this image has detail in it now similarly with the black slider when i move it to the left you'll start to see blue come in on the image and you'll see down here in the bottom part of the image there's a lot of blue being splashed in areas that means i'm clipping the shadows or clipping the blacks again that means there's no detail there at all now typically though it's all personal taste i like to clip the shadows a tiny bit to me that gives my image more tonal depth i have absolute black all the way through almost absolute white not quite so i might have it clipped just a little bit now i could come back in and readjust like highlights maybe open those up a little more overall stuff like that so just doing these sliders and tell you the truth i kind of don't like them clipping on this image so it's not like something that i absolutely possibly would do positively do every single time meaning i have the blacks clip just a little bit every time it's really on an image to image basis and as i move it down i just think it's a little too dark down in here so i'll just have it so it's just not clipping and i had a little blue over there but it's gone so just like that and that's what i like so i just moved four sliders and it looks pretty good now i might experiment with smart contrast and to tell you the truth i don't usually uh add contrast with the contrast sliders in any application i'm doing i prefer to get contrast like i just did by moving highlight shadows whites and blacks that's the way i apply contrast to me any other slider is kind of overboard i don't want that much contrast now i should add in the case of this image i skipped a couple sliders right at the top i skipped the profile drop down in the white balance the white balance to me was fine so i just didn't even bother looking at it the profile the luminol luminar default profile was fine of course i have a lot of other profiles i could choose from down here in the drop down but i think luminar default was fine and the temperature intent i mentioned the white balance is fine so i don't have to do anything there usually though if i do adjust white balance i do it with the eyedropper so i click on the eyedropper and i click on something that's neutral like a white cloud a gray wall something like that and that would be my white balance adjustment now in this case it warmed it up just a slight a slight amount i'm going to undo that by hitting command z as in zebra on my mac it's ctrl z on a pc so i don't apply that temperature white balance adjustment so um i like it now if i did want to mess around though with contrast at all i would usually use curves to do it and i would put a gentle s curve in in the image now i don't think this image needs it but i'll demonstrate it anyway what i would do is i'd put up a point right in the middle then i'd go down to the bottom left hand corner of the curve right around here this is the shadows and i'd make the shadows a little darker by pulling down on the curve then over here at the top i'd go this is where the highlights reside i'd put a point there and push up a little bit so i'm making the highlights a little brighter and that's pretty much what contrast is you're making the lighter parts or the brighter parts brighter and the darker parts darker now again i'm going to hit command z a few times to undo those adjustments because i don't want them on this image i don't think it needs it so i'm done with light next i'm going to skip structure and go down to color and one thing i should add this was shot at the lowest available iso on the xt4 which i think was 160. i actually love this camera but a friend of mine really wanted it so i sold it to him and um i don't have it anymore so i think it's iso 160 but anyway my friend's um a wedding photographer and he was upgrading his equipment he's actually switching from nikon to fuji and he asked me if i was interested in selling him the camera and i gave him a deal on it so he now owns this camera but that's beside the point as i was saying i was shot at very low iso so there really isn't any noise to speak of so i really don't have to worry about going to denoise right now but usually after i do tone i'll go to noise and i'll remove noise next then what i'll do is i'll go to color and with color this image is pretty saturated color so i'm not even going to move the saturation vibrant sliders and this is one thing i remind a lot of people that are new to post-processing is just because a slider is there doesn't mean you have to use it seems like most photographers always add saturation or vibrance or both every single time you really don't then part of the reason why is in this image i'm going to go down to the hsl part of the color tool and i'm going to go first of all to luminance and i want to brighten up the green grasses and there's a lot of yellow in there so i'm going to move yellow to the right and see how it's just brightening it up and it's giving me again more tonal variance across the image it's given me some lighter tones uh contrasted against some darker tones so we have some light green with darker green and throughout the hills the same thing and i could even bring that even stronger i could move green to the left but i'm not going to do that i don't think we need to um i'm going to make the blue sky just a little darker by moving blue to the left just a little bit cyan maybe a little bit too you'll see cyan will affect the sky usually more towards the horizon compared to the blue slider so i'll bring that down now i'm going to go to the saturation this is where i'll use some selective saturation i want to make those yellows a little more saturated the greens a bit more saturated and maybe the blue just a touch just to touch just like that so i'm done i'm done with color then what i'll do is i'll kind of experiment i'll jump back up to structure and see if adding structure is something i want to do you can see i still have the clipping indicators off you can see as i move the amount of structure to the right i'm getting clipping uh that's good maybe to leave them on but usually tell you truth i'll turn them off right away it's just in doing this video and chatting here i forgot to do it to turn the clipping indicators back off just hit the j key on your keyboard again j is in jack and you turn them off now i'm going to undo that i don't think i need any structure on this landscape image i'm not going to convert it to black and white let's go to details though and maybe we'll um sharpen it first i usually work these sliders from bottom to top it's just the way i do it large details maybe a little bit medium details this is very easy to overdo it here you can see i have very slight movements of these sliders but you could very easily over sharpen your image with these sliders that's part of the reason why i like going from the bottom up i think it just is easier to not overdo it when i go from bottom uh to top i don't need to mask anything so i think we're good there as i mentioned it really doesn't have any noise in it now you have all this landscape slider and here if there was any haze there's just a slight amount of haze out here in the distance not much i think it actually adds to the image though but i can move that to the right a golden hour i could give everything more of a warm warm tone and foliage enhancer which here we have of course a lot of grass so you can move that to the right and tell you the truth i think all of those are overdoing it a little bit you know i want it to re to look like i remember it looking like and not you know something surreal now i could finish it off you could see this first part the essentials tab you just go from top to bottom and you could really finish the image and i could go with the vignette i like to add a vignette because typically when someone looks at an image they're going to look at first and have their eyes linger on the brighter parts of the image and if you have really bright areas like these clouds up here at the top they may stray their eyes may stray looking more towards the edges and not in the middle and subconsciously that will give them a non-pleasing experience when they look at the image so what i like to do is add a darker vignette to try to subtly push their gaze more towards the middle of the image and subconsciously it will give them a better experience when they view the image now i'm going to skip vignette it for now i'll come back to it though i just want to go on and talk about some other things now if you had a boring sky you of course could replace the sky skylim got a lot of press because of their um sky replacement tools that were found first in luminar 4 and then later in luminar ai i mean tremendous you could do this in photoshop it's a little more difficult although photoshop now has a more automatic tool that doesn't work anywhere near as well as luminar ai's tool does so you could do that they have augmented sky i mean if you wanted to get crazy and you could put let's say mountains in the background something like that i mean so easy to do but here i'm not even going to play with any of that i'm not doing that um atmosphere if you want to add fog to the image you can see it's adding it to the top layered fog is more towards the middle mist is more towards the top again and haze is more in the middle it looks like right there yeah but i'm not doing any of those either i just like it the way it is sun rays isn't applicable but if you had a bright point uh pointed light source you could add sun rays from that pointed light source like the sun or even a street lamp or something like that uh dramatic you could add drama you know to the image this is that hdr look which many of us loathe so i'll skip that totally mood are luts um let's i use quite a bit actually but in this image here again i want to go for this more natural look the way i remember it seeing or remember seeing it and if i go to a lot i mean it's going to change the look of the image quite a bit so we're going to totally uh skip luts toning this you know if you want to tone the highlights with a specific color and the shadows with another color you could do that that's split toning in lightroom same thing split toning isn't in lightroom anymore but in older versions of lightroom there was split toning um matt you could see how it gives a kind of that film matte look again nothing i'm interested here mystical this is kind of you just kind of give the darker and brighter areas kind of this glow to to it there's glow below that as you could see same thing you have a drop down there and you could do that orton effect which many people like i like orton effects more for portraiture not so much for landscape images but a lot of people do apply them very effectively in landscape images again if you're going for that film look you could add some grain to the image too nothing i'm doing here then we have those portrait adjust adjustments i alluded to at the top of this video very powerful i'll do videos in the future where i deep dive take a deep dive into these tools here optics here is one that's at the bottom and i really wish it was more at the top because typically you want to do auto distortion uh correction you could see how it changed did you see that still a little blurry there it is there's before and there's after and chromatic aberration there's some advanced settings there if um it didn't do anything you're using a manual lens on a like a maybe it's a scan of a negative or a slide so there is no lens and camera information in the metadata you may have to do it manually down here you could do that as well super contrast i use now and then but not that often i'm not going to need it on this image again color harmony i did a video on this entire tool because it's one of my favorites but again there's actually four tools here kind of all nested together but again i don't think this image needs it dodge and burn nothing needed here for dodge and burn and clone there's nothing in this image i need to get rid of or duplicate now after sitting here talking for a while it looks over sharpened to me and this happens quite a bit uh when you're sitting in front of your computer doing it your eyes get fatigued and your brain gets kind of tired and you don't really notice that you're over sharpening it so you could come back in now in here and you could kind of dial everything down a little bit because it was just too much that's it i really could have been done earlier put the vignette in here to make it a darker vignette i usually like it very subtle a lot of times i see people put really heavy ones on i really don't need nothing that heavy there's advanced settings here if i want to change the roundness of the vignette the feathering of the vignette and so on i'll leave everything in its more default position what i will do is i will go to inner light and i'm just going to brighten up the middle what that will do is just brighten up the middle just a little bit now i may it may make me start clipping the highlights i'll hit the j key again and you can see that with my adjustments i started clipping those shadows just a little bit but that's all right as i mentioned several times i don't mind clipping the shadows i really don't like clipping highlights though so i get just a bit of red right there maybe there and there but that's all right there hit the j key again turn those off that's it that's my processed landscape to me it's natural it's the way i remember it being when i was there we had some really beautiful blue skies with that beautiful clouds and i actually went here because uh this location i'm familiar with and behind me are two ponds and i wanted to photograph the ponds behind me but the sun was behind me in the claw and it was all hazy with sun and it it just the pictures didn't look as good as turning around 180 degrees and shooting the other direction and that's what i did and this was the the better scene for the light i was given for the hour i was there so that's it luminar ai in my opinion it's a landscape photographer's dream thank you everyone who watches my videos i really do appreciate it i'll talk to you guys soon", "WiD71-n4J8Q": "what up YouTube california grown here i got some plants in here and the watering system all done so we'll go over it but first things first blue dream on the left purple dog and the middle blue dream on the right and the reason i split them up is because i am going to be doing an experiment in here i believe and i wanted them to be under the same reflectors because the middle reflector is different right now which is bugging me and i will fix that just don't really feel like spending 200 bucks on your reflector for a couple of weeks so eventually that will change they will all be the same but back to the experiment what I'm going to do is I'm gonna be taking hey get out of here go and let me taking my little girl room apart the closet one and I'm gonna be taking the text shield and I think I'm going to mount a piece of text shield on a 45 right here and on that side to see if I can get some added growth off reflecting up a little bit to the undergrowth of the plane so I've never seen anybody do it can't really find too much research on it so I'm probably going to be doing that on this blue dream tray and not on the other and I want to see if it will increase my yield so if I notice quickly that these plants are doing much better then I'll probably do it to all of them if not i'll probably pull it out because it will be kind of annoying we'll see so that's a little experiment i'm gonna be doing but as you can see Pierre lip you layer cocoa at the top no pair of light and yeah these things are beautiful I mean just got them home from barn dizzily getting about this tall they are in bed still as you can see cloned take a clone off the top that way give the edges a little bit of room to catch up and I probably won't veg these for about another week or so I mean I'd really like to do more but as far as time goes I want to get these things going but they're looking good so I'm really stoked on these and another note right here I got a comment on my last video about my controllers and my power strip being a little too close to the flood table and that is a valid point but this flood table is not ever to be flooded so these are not actually flood tables I have them here as a backup in case my Apollo 1 was to go out and if that happened and all the water pumped out of my reservoir it would all be sitting in these tables and only filling up about halfway so theoretically I should never have a problem with any water in the flood table hopefully cross my fingers as long as the Apollo 1 never fails on me but uh yeah so that's that not too much as new air conditioners still down there still going to move that I'll probably salvage some of the wood out of the little grow room when I break it down to build the shelf for that and also I haven't gone ahead and gone with an intake yet the plants seem to be working perfectly with the door closed pulling the air in under the door but there is not a lot of negative pressure in here because the lights are on a closed a closed loop for the lights because I will be putting a propane burner in here to convert to co2 for the next grow and the exhaust I only have it set to run for like 15 minutes an hour so there's not a whole lot of negative pressure in here and my windows are always open in my apartment so it's plants are getting a lot of fresh air but anyways back to the watering system pretty simple just the half inch tubing took it and punched it put the little quarter inch strip valves in and ran to plant right now I have it watering for 20 seconds every eight hours that will change is my plants get bigger and need more water obviously but for now that's that and as far as nutrients go Gabe um I put these in let's see put these in thursday excuse me put them in yesterday gave them a full-strength batch of voodoo juice let them have just beauty juice for 24 hours and then I did create them sensi grow a and B and I rent I only ran the sensi grow and be at two milliliters per liter versus four milliliters per liter which is this is suggested rate to run it at but that was just because I had to the 500 milliliter bottles and I didn't really feel like buying any more since I'm only going to have one week of veg probably so for now they're just going to get that and I will keep you posted throw a video up next week let you know what they look like hopefully they'll be quite a bit bigger by next week and probably do a dark cycle I don't know thursday from Thursday to Friday night and send them into flower friday night into saturday so we'll see but next time you see these things they should be in their first week of flour so anyways thanks guys letter", "H8er8xS1s5g": "good afternoon everybody and welcome to this presentation of pacer integrative behavioral health today we are talking about terpenes in cannabis cbd and essential oils and as always i'm your host dr donnelly snipes so let's start out with the important information and disclaimers always consult with your doctor about any changes to health behaviors including the use of essential oils taking supplements or changing your diet cannabis and cbd interact with most medications unfortunately including over-the-counter medications so medical supervision is essential that being said let's talk about terpenes and terpenes are the aromatic compounds found in plants that's not just in cannabis or cbd any of your plants so terpenes are what you are finding in the essential oils if you're familiar with those so we're going to talk about specifically the terpenes that are found in cannabis but i'm also going to tell you where you can find those same terpenes in other plants if you are not you know interested in cannabis inhalation or ingestion of terpenes the aromatic compounds can have anti-inflammatory anti-anxiety antidepressant anti-fungal antibacterial neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects so terpenes can be awesome and if you are familiar with essential oils you are familiar with the fact that a lot of essential oils have been demonstrated in research to have calming effects or uplifting effects um appetite suppressive effects it does this when we inhale the terpenes the in terms of essential oils when we inhale the terpenes it activates sensory receptors in our nose that send messages to our brain that alter our neuro chemicals they actually interact with the receptors in our well it causes the neurochemicals to interact with receptors in our brain so terpenes can be really awesome um because you know again they are something that can be smelled um in terms of cannabis and cbd related products terpenes are also found in the in the plant itself and well and you can also find it in other plants like sage and rosemary and oregano when you eat those plants you are ingesting the terpenes now do not ingest essential oils essential oils are extremely extraordinarily potent distilled down forms of this the essential oil from the plant and high high high concentration of terpenes they can be toxic very easily i know some people do ingest essential oils but it is extremely dangerous and needs to be done definitely under a doctor's supervision that being said when terpenes are ingested orally and again that can mean just eating oregano or cumin they exert their influence in the digestive tract and throughout the immune system so just because you're not smoking it or inhaling it doesn't mean the terpenes aren't doing the work so that that's kind of my take home there is no matter how your body connects with the terpenes they do have effects of the 120 different terpenes that are found in cannabis for example um any of them may influence the their overall effects of cannabis by helping the cannabinoids to penetrate the blood or penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily by altering liver metabolism of the cannabinoids or by contributing to their own therapeutic properties this is called the entourage effect and basically it says you know when you have the effects of the cannabinoids like thc or cbd um plus terpenes that also activate those receptors or um assist in in creating those effects they may work synergistically and that's not just true of cannabis that's true of a lot of things that they they found that essential oils can actually enhance the effectiveness of certain herbs and medications so let's talk about some of these terpenes and the terpenes give things their unique smell if you are familiar with essential oils you know for example that there are like 12 different kinds of lavender each one of them has a slightly different aroma to it same thing there's not as many different types of frankincense uh chamomile there's roman and german so each one of these has a different balance of terpenes in them but in terms of the main terpenes that are can be found in different types of cannabis or cbd oil we have mircine this is typically found in your indica strains of cannabis it can also be found in bay leaf verbena pine juniber and lemongrass plants and essential oils so if you're looking for an essential oil that will produce the effects of myrcin you know those are some options that you have mircine is anti-inflammatory antiometic which means it helps you helps with nausea and sedative so it helps you calm down it reduces inflammation and makes your tummy feel happier now i did do some research i am um relatively new to learning about cannabis um so i did do the some research and found that cannabis strains that tend to have mir seen in it include blue dream sour diesel northern lights pineapple and skunk xl you can also again get a mircine it's available in certain broad spectrum cbd oils you just you need to really do your research and specifically look and ask if it if if they know whether the cbd oil has this particular terpene in it the next terpene and this is one of my favorite it's limonene you can typically find it in the sativas your cannabis sativa strains it's citrusy it has a you can find it in lemon essential oil orange essential oil spearmint i actually ordered d limonene which is a an industrial strength degreaser but it is limonene it to clean my house i use it in my laundry i use it to clean it is very uplifting limonene has antidepressant anti-anxiety effects and it also has been shown in some cases to enhance immunity so those are all really awesome properties now in terms of cannabis and cbd limonene tends to be higher as i said in the sativas and the strains that typically have higher amounts of limonene include sour diesel sweet tooth and super lemon haze pretty much if it has the name of a citrus fruit in it the rule that i found in on one of the sites was that it probably has a high level of limonene in it the next one is another one of my favorites it's linalool and this is the main constituent in lavender essential oil and we all are familiar with lavender essential oil and how it can be very calming interestingly enough linalool is also very common or very very high concentration in coriander cilantro and basil now i love basil and i love lavender i cannot stand coriander or cilantro so i thought that was really interesting that this particular terpene was really high in all four of those plants and they have such different aromas to them which tells you that there are other terpenes at work and they may have slightly different therapeutic effects i know my donkey for example isn't crazy about lavender but she loves cilantro i grow cilantro in the garden and she just eats it all the time so anyway that's kind of a side note linalool is helpful for relaxation sleep and they found in some research that it's helpful for seizure reduction in terms of cannabis strains fire og og shark and amnesia haze are purported to have higher levels of linole than other strains karyophiline is the next terpene we're going to talk about and this is a spicy terpene and it is found commonly in black pepper cinnamon oregano cloves and thyme so i thought it was interesting going back here that um anyhow some things that have a clove-like smell really don't have you know really aren't related to clove at all but in terms of terpenes that are actually in cloves and oregano it's karyophiline karyophylene is anti-inflammatory analgesic so it's pain relieving and they found in some studies it may reduce alcohol consumption now i am not saying to do to use it as a detox um but karyophylline essential oil might be helpful as an addition to a detox protocol under the supervision of a physician remember alcohol detox can very quickly be life threatening even if you are not a an all the time drinker even if you're a binge drinker sometimes your blood pressure can skyrocket when you are detoxing from alcohol so please please please if you are undergoing alcohol detox make sure to do it medically supervised strains of cannabis and cbd oil that have karyophiline in them include northern lights fire og harlequin and super silver haze and i'm sure there are others out there i was just kind of trying to give you a quick um rundown of different types because you can if you've been to a dispensary you know that there are different strains of cannabis and cbd oil derived from those different strains of cannabis that have slightly different properties and that's really what we're talking about here is figuring out uh which ones might have the um best terpenes that work for you if you are in recovery from addiction again you can use essential oils you don't need to use cbd oil you don't need to use cannabis to find these terpenes i just think it's interesting as we start to learn more about cannabis how incredibly powerful this plant is that we've ignored for so long and how many you know unique effects it has alpha and beta pinene are obviously um terpenes that are derived from pine type plants they smell very piney think pine salt balsam rosemary frankincense cypress and juniper berry are the ones that are more common i mean there's also spruce and a few others if you've smelled different pine essential oils you know some of them have a more woody smell and some of them have a more citrusy smell and that tells you that there are other terpenes that are in there in addition to the alpha and beta pinene pinene terpenes tend to be anti-inflammatory improve breathing improve memory and alertness they can also help buffer against the memory effects or the memory problems that can be caused by long-term cannabis use according to research now it's important to remember that you know think about in terms of improving breathing you know if you are smoking it's likely not going to improve your breathing so it's important if you're trying to find a way to improve your breathing it's important to consider how are you going to get that terpene into your system in order to do that and that is where you consult your physician who can tell you the best way to do it but strains of cannabis with pinenes in them include pineapple purple kush cherry bomb blue dream and sweet skunk cumulene is a terpene that's found in hops and we're all familiar with hops in terms of beer and things like that it has an earthy aroma and humulin can be found in sage cloves again basil and black pepper it is also anti-inflammatory sense a little pattern here appetite suppressant and calming now a lot of people when they think of cannabis they think of the munchies um and that can be a side effect but the um humulene is an essential oil that actually can help suppress appetite birthday cake great white shark and sour diesel evidently um are high in humulene terpinoline has a piney floral type smell to it and it can be found naturally in sage rosemary and tea tree oil tea tree oil is probably the preeminent example it is really strong in tea tree oil it has anti-anxiety relaxation and sedative properties it can be found in strains such as dutch treat and jack herrer geraniol this is another one that i really like in essential oils some say it has a tobacco-like aroma it also has a floral scent geraniol comes from the geranium plant mainly that's where it's you know most uh most prominent most most strong but it's also can be found in rose rose geranium and citronella so thinking about each one of those they smell a little bit different but they all have high levels of geraniol which is a neuroprotective antioxidant and antibacterial notice it's not one that's listed as anti-inflammatory but it does have a lot of other really awesome properties to it that can be found in purple punch dutch hawaiian kimbo kush og shark and amnesia hayes osiemanine osimin can be found in basil and bergamot and it's said to have a musky odor to it i love both basil and bergamot i don't think of either one of those as musky but you know whatever maybe i have a different definition of musky but basil if you think about basil it does have sort of a woody earthy flake smell to it bergamot is more of a citrusy smell so obviously in most essential oils there are going to be multiple different types of terpenes the same thing is true in just about every plant this is anti-inflammatory anti-fungal antiviral uplifting and energizing in terms of cannabis strains it can be found in chocolate thai strawberry shortcake goji og and huckleberry other terpenes that can be helpful they're not as prominent in the cannabis plants but they have been shown to have some effect or they think it has some effect for helping people with alzheimer's and with inflammatory conditions um include eucalyptol eucalyptol can also be helpful for lung functioning think about you know what's in vic vapor rub you know it's there's a lot of eucalyptus in there tea tree oil and eucalyptus are both very high in eucalyptol strains of cannabis that are high in it include bubble gum super silver haze and acdc and finally terpenes that have antioxidant anti-inflammatory antifungal and possible cholesterol lowering properties include camphine and sabinene and you can find the caffeine in acdc banana kush ghost og and strawberry banana i am not advocating for the use of cannabis what i am doing is letting you know about all of the components that are in a lot of plants including cannabis and some of these terpenes or all of these terpenes can help us understand why cannabis works the way it does why it is so powerful for example for nausea reduction and to help people with pain they found that people who use cannabis and this can be you know it through edibles have a significantly reduced amount of pain they've done a lot of testing on uh with people using oral mucosal sprays that contain a one-to-one ratio of thc in cannabis and they found that it has a lot of varied anti-inflammatory anti-anxiety effects to it so there's a lot of new interesting research that's coming to the fore but all of these and that's why for each one of them i also wanted to point out that the different essential oils that you could also find these terpenes in if you want to stay way away from cbd or way away from cannabis that is you know totally cool i mean a lot of people um need to stay away from it for one reason or another if you are taking any other medication cbd and cannabis will likely interact with it because of the pathway that metabolizes it so you know it may not be an option for you um i know it's not an option for me because it interacts with medication i have to take on a daily basis um so then you would look to some of the essential oils that i have listed like the the lavender and the rose geranium and the rosemary and bergamot and and those other things in order to get um similar effects now i know that there was a lot of stuff in there and it may take you a few minutes to digest that but are there any questions about terpenes morgan in terms of cannabis usage and dissociation i would have to do more research on that um and and see what the correlation or what what the correlating variables are because saying that there is or is not a connection between cannabis usage and dissociation um for anybody or everybody is probably too broad i would need to examine specific populations and see if there's a greater risk in uh dissociation for them such as people with extreme ptsd alrighty everybody have a fabulous rest of your day and i will see you next time", "InpiroMh-P0": "today we're taking a look at a few ways to make DIY legend filters welcome to film riot the show takes mystery out of the effects technique school assume your favorite holiday songs and Rose Connelly and Linz filters are often a must-have but often very very expensive some don't have good workarounds you really have to spend the money to get good stuff like ND filters for me I do really want a camera that has ND filters built-in but when it doesn't it's just the worst but when you're shooting outside with the camera that doesn't have it built-in you absolutely need it to properly control your exposure then you have a circular polarizer another must-have when shooting outside pop it on your lens and give it a spin to adjust the color of your sky or even grass and if you're trying to shoot through glass like into a car give this guy a turn and you now have Superman vision then you have one of my favorite filters the black probe mist this one just gives a slight glow and lessens the contrast to the image almost as if there were a little bit of haze in the room but this is one that you could definitely find some DIY alternatives for for instance in an older episode we showed how using some stockings on the lens would give you a similar effect we tried them on the front of the lens on the back and different types some of the more fishnet style stockings gave me a closer look to the black probe mist but all of them had unique and interesting effects but now let's jump into some cheap and/or free DIY ideas to get interesting effects raining camera first most of us do have gels for our lights floating around so try grabbing one of these and topping them in front of your lens of course it make this and a lot of the others that we're going to show work you'll have to have decently shallow depth-of-field if you're very close down you're going to start to see the scene before you can do things like tossing a light blue gel in front of our lens or make it more interesting by just moving a bit of that gel in front of the lens just to get a slightly odd effect or any other color you want like a red gel just dip it slightly into frame to get a very interesting gradient that plays with the lights in the scene in a very organic way that you can't easily get by trying to replicate that in post now if you want to go crazy and invest some hardcore dollars like 8 bucks I got those UV filter from the Amazons of the dot-com for just about $8 which does what it sounds like it blocks UV light but the effect isn't very apparent so you can use it almost as clear glass in front of your lens so now we can add weird stuff to the front of the lens without damaging it like Vaseline which as it turns out is not just for rubbing on your employee basically all we're doing here smudging and blurring the image wherever we put the Vaseline so we could add just a small amount to the side of the filter to get that smudge sort of gradient or in a circle around the center to give a vignette of smudgy blurry goodness or add a light layer of it onto your entire lens whatever you're looking for the world is your Lobster I'll murder you in your sleep but the Vaseline spread all over the filter you get this great dreamlike look sort of reminds me of moments in Minority Report very stylized and very cool of course you can keep wiping it away or adding more to dial in the look you want or change the direction of where you wipe the filter left to right will give you horizontal type flares up and down will give you vertical it's just a really simple way to get some interesting looks now we have two more that we're going to look at but first let's add some dollars to my hire I hit man to kill Josh fund again what [Music] gosh no Bob we're not doing this again nope yes Rosalyn no no no just Eduardo you're silly you know we all stop he's Bob you do anything if you're a budding filmmaker entrepreneur innovator domain.com is the place to go when the next great

comms check out and when you think domain names think domain.com [Music] now go Edward back next up is the highlighter yes highlighter take the color of your choice we went with a reddish color and color in half of your filter you'll get the best effect with this and a more well lit scene but what you get is a really trippy style to your shot that could be perfect for flashbacks jumping into someone's memory or a credit sequence and so on it has a sort of off but interesting look to it which of course you could do with any color you want it you could also just leave a small slit in the middle of the filter and color in everything else for an even more intense version of this could work really well for close-ups or maybe rotate and look down hall you can create a custom version to fit any shot perfectly [Music] in our last effect is custom bokeh which is when you create shapes out of the out of focus points in your scene like so a heart where star or whatever else you can think of Alex blow no use this somewhat recently for an opening credits of SNL and it's super easy to do to make this you're going to need start construction paper something sharp like an exacto knife scissors pen or pencil a fast lens like 1.5 fathom man and the lens cap for your lens got all those things good Kit Kat with all your goodies place the lens cap over the paper draw a circle around the lens cap then cut out the circle you just created with the exacto knife once you have the circle draw a smiley face pretend it's Josh and cut it in half with the scissors realize you overreacted repeat the first two steps and then draw the shape you want in the middle of the circle next we'll cut that shape out with the exacto knife trying to make the shape decently small if you make the shapes too big the mistakes that you make when cutting it become more prominent in the book of shapes it just doesn't work as well overall after that make small cuts around the edges of the circle so that the paper can grip onto your lens if that doesn't work you could always just use tape but now with it secure to your lens point your camera and throw that data focus boom custom shaped bokeh ballsacks okay what shapes not what you said so again and that's it a handful of ways to add unique looks to your project without spending more than the price of a starbucks coffee but before we go in

this one is called DRH haze and i'm wearing head the colors ombre heel green and i love this color I said that even yesterday I think I did a teal green I love this color the wig is just very long it's like 28 inches long I would say between 28 to 30 inches long and it just comes curly this is what the stock card looks like it has like a little bang only on this side on your left side it comes with a part it's not a lace front it's not a lace Parton it's just a flash part it's a full wig so keep that in mind so the only con I have with this is the Parden space same as the Ricki mode with the previous parts and even some of their regular parts like they look so much better than this like I would think they could do some more work on the part in space with this that's the only con I have about this is the part in space it's not that great so like I said it is a flesh type part and all I did was add some powder I did not squeeze it I just thought it didn't make any sense but I just add some powder I think it's okay you know it turned out ok but at the same time they could do a lot more with the part but anyway let me turn the wrong show you what the back looks like Shutterstock music so this one also has just two homes upfront and the adjustable straps at the back guys under here could get a little bit Tryon you I realize it feels a little bit try after a while after you run your fingers through it it does tangle it does shed a little bit but if you're gonna purchase this I would say like you can have like a small moisturizer or even like a little oil just to rub on your hands and then you know when your hands through it like probably sometimes during the day because it feels like it's gonna dry out and it's probably gonna tangle rubbing against your back or your clothes or something if you're gonna wear this all day but I think it's cute overall I think it's a really nice unit you could go out with this you can go on a date with this I wouldn't really say so much for work I think it's just too long for work but yeah I mean it's totally up to you it depends on what you like the hair is heat safe up to 400\u00b0 so you can definitely put some heat to it you can change the curl pattern if you want to that's totally up to you again so it can be washed as well so if you were to put too much products in the year you can wash it but the care instructions come in the back of the stock card so all you got to do is just follow the instructions be careful and you can go ahead and wash it but anyway guys um thank you so much for watching um oh yes the cap is big at front knee keep that in mine as well and it is comfortable as well I didn't have any irritation or anything like that so that's a plus and then a thank you so much for watching I hope this was helpful any questions leave it down below be sure to answer it as soon as possible don't forget like and subscribe if you haven't done so as yet follow us on instagram at big times and I'll see you soon my next video", "4Lk3NrQSWlU": "hi everyone in this video I'll be doing something a little different I'll be dyeing my hair purple I wanted to film the process of me doing this because first of all I've never done this before and second I wanted you guys to see how I did it hopefully it comes out right because I'm not a hair specialist so hopefully this will be good so first let me tell you what my goal is I'm going to lighten my hair just like two shades lighter to a light brown as you can see it's like a dark brown so I want to lighten that just a little bit I don't want to bleach it completely blonde because I don't want the color vibrant if you know what I mean I'll be using the color purple haze Byronic panic the kind of perform going for it is not a bright purple I don't want someone to be like whoa your hair is purple but more like oh you're here stressful it looks nice I have gloves a bowl and a spoon to mix the bleach the bleach of using is prison whites and it has a violet tint to it so it has less of the brassy tones in it and I'll be using a ten developer I'll be doing a bleach wash so to do bleach wash you make the bleach like regular and then you add shampoo to it so I'll be adding tea tree Trader Joe's shampoo with the bleach wash then I have a shower cap and a t-shirt you don't care for it and I'm all done having the purple hair dye and it's washing everything I'll be putting on the caviar shine boost so it locks in the color and goes in my shine the first thing I'm going to do is I need to def pin my hair with water you don't want it dripping wet but you don't want any dry spots this is gonna help so when you add the bleach and the shampoo it's gonna last in your hair I'm mixing one part of the bleach and two parts of the developer I chose to do a bleach wash because it's less damaging to my hair and I only wanted a couple it's lighter for the shampoo I'm only adding the amount I would use for when I wash my hair on a regular basis if you add more than what you need to the bleach won't process in your hair now I'm parting my hair to prepare it to add the bleach I'm gonna start at the bottom and not go towards my roots yet if you're going to bleach your hair don't start on your roots because then your roots will end up lighter than the rest of your hair I like that bleach sit in my hair for half an hour with a cap over it so the heat presses it a little faster yes just the color I wanted it's not too blonde and it's perfect now I'm gonna wash my hair in the bathtub with warm water since I'm gonna be dyeing my hair purple right after I wash it and dry it I don't want to use a conditioner because then the purple won't stick to my hair right well my hair is orange time friends of purple I've been wanting to dye my hair purple for the longest time but I never had enough confidence and information to do myself because I didn't want to mess up so I spoke with some friends who are hair specialists got a lot of techniques and watched a lot of YouTube videos to do it correctly so I finally have the confidence to know exactly what I was going to do and not myself a little disclaimer out there everyone's hair is different so before trying this at home consult with the professional but I hope this video helps you and gives you ideas I almost forgot I need to put vaseline around my hairline but I don't have a saline so I'm gonna be using Vicks [Music] now I'm blow-drying my hair so the heat locks in the color in the hair cuticles I let the color sit in my hair for two hours after two hours I wash my hair in cold water so the hair cuticles close after the water ran clear I put on the 3-minute conditioning mask then I let my hair air dry yay time for the final result my hair is purple it looks really warm here because of the lamp but I'll show you some pictures on how it looks in different lighting I'm super happy about the final results and I'm glad it's all even and I didn't mess up this is how the hair colour really looks when it's not being hit by direct sunlight thank you so much for watching thumbs up this video and subscribe to watch crafty videos [Music]", "LJ_9htTE3zU": "Thank

genetics real click here and you're the two that we were underfeeding last week I have not transplanted them yet but they are about to get transplanted these are the Lands End right here two three four five this is the Lands End see how nice and fleshy these things are doing lovely these here are just the backups in case these are males and I've got a few left and cups that I'm about to give away to people a couple friends of mine looking for some cuts I'm gonna give these away and that's pretty much it for what's in bed right now all right guys I just want to show you what I got in the mail the other day look at that this came completely by surprise I opened up the box and I was blown away this was a gift by a friend of mine who also has a youtube channel and his name is Medicaid he's been a friend of mine since pretty much the beginning of my channel or there there abouts this is the kind of gift that blows me away I don't need things in life like materialistically speaking I'm very happy with everything that I have I don't need a lot of new things if I have my grow and I have a camera and I can make movies I'm pretty happy so when somebody gets you a gift like this that's really really well thought-out Medicaid I just want to say special thanks to you I know that took a lot of work I know you had to pull my long ago and send it and you know just for you to do that I just think it's amazing and I want to thank you for it buddy if you haven't checked out Medicaid channel he's got a great channel he just converted over to full organics channel is just a wealth of information she has how to build a grow room how to mix your own soil and he's breaking down how to do organics correctly and I really like this guy because he does his homework but he's also a very good to mine and if you get a chance check him out and if you're into synthetics he's kind of a lot of great information on synthetic growing too so you just want to grow with newts that's how he used to grow and he's a what I would call a world-class pro or a kind of sewer grower so check out his channel links in the description I think you'll really really like it and the only thing I want to talk about on the plants this week as you can see you can see on the leaves here there's some chattering on the edges and that's a phosphorus and potassium deficiency it's fairly normal as the plants develop these flowers they're pushing really hard and developing big heavy dense flowers so we're gonna get a little pull on the Leafs I get a lot more production if I'm slightly under fed or right at feeding than I am if I over feed if I over feed I never get a good production out of my crop [Music]", "chJq4SytWtM": "what's going on guys how are you alright it's week four update and I'm just gonna do a quick little dab or two real quick and we're gonna use the business sit down to coffee up for the record if I had a Santa Cruz bakeware coffee mug I'd probably use it on every show it's not a hint or anything if daddy goes watch and that's like Nana I've got an edible here it's a 200 milligram very cookies and cream which I'm not gonna eat in front of you but I am gonna eat half of this 100 milligrams of it and it's supposed to be four doses but edibles don't work that strong at me so I got some Keith rosin that I got from the local dispensary it's some sort of a berry blend it's what they call clear concentrates it's essentially the essence of it pulled out they pull everything out the terpenes and everything this has almost no flavor and I'm gonna get you guys some close-ups on this stuff too but really really good stuff I got the bucket of it here this is three and a half grams and you can get them in one gram if you want but I really like this stuff so I use it it's supposed to be 98 percent THC let's do a couple dabs and then we'll get rolling I can honestly say I'm ripped up hope you guys are ripped with me whoo let's check out the girls sorry guys super quick check in on the little guys there's the five lands on over there these are the two Jack her heirs they're just a genetic preservation a little bit light I just beefed up the feeding on these today so yeah everything's looking good all right so as we walk in the room I'm just gonna say two things about the garden this week what have I done in the garden is suite number one did a very light Wylie popping this time I really just took off the dead stuff and kind of left the plant nice and full then the guard is pretty much my includes control right now the only other thing I'm concerned about is constantly checking for bugs and making sure I'm not over feeding or under feeding the plants trying to just get that nice and medium area you a shout out every week and you see this tree behind me I'm no arborist but I'm guessing this tree somewhere in the neighborhood of about 70 years old it's massive I'll show you a picture of it from a few hundred feet away you can see how big this thing is I love this little spot and I figured I'd take this time to shout out my good friend tree channel who has been subscribed to me since I think I had about 10 subscribers and I think five of those were friends of mine self really he's been around since the beginning it was very supportive and shouted me out and got me subs early on and it's just really really helpful he has a great little channel he does a grow he does little smoke things that he does sometimes he even cooks breakfasts hit a chance his links in the description check them out and sub him up show him a little love so until next time guys keep it growing", "UgwaX8-tysQ": "folks and Grammy welcome to my bro Tennant always growing always learning grab the camera get me in here so as you saw with the thumbnail in the title this video I want to discuss with you the differences between a trained cannabis plant and an untrained cannabis plant most of this will be just my opinion to take from it what you want some flowers are doing well marigolds probably not going to grow and I can't remember what bag is called celosia anyways that's not why we're here those out of the way get to the cannabis so over here oh I suppose I should start by telling you these are all Auto flower plants not photo periods these are the two youngest ones they are 29 30 days old Northern Lights on the Left blue dramatic back there so these ones about a week ago actually eight days ago to be exact I put a video on YouTube where I showed the training of these plants so I'll leave a link in the description below to that video if you want you could if you haven't watched it pause this check out that video to see what these plants look like eight days ago and come back join this video again yeah the training went well the plants responded well no issues the blue dramatic really caught me off guard and went into flower like two days after I trained it so I wasn't sure if that was induced by the training or if that was just in the genetics and that's how it was going to go regardless of what I did considering the Northern Lights auto flower received similar training at the exact same time I don't believe it was the training that induced flowering anyways you can see these plants due to the training have a nice level canopy everything's pretty even on top as opposed to these ones so the the one on the right there that is my bloody skunk and it is 48 days old that little girl there is a big bud Otto it is 30 or no sorry 47 days old different size clearly but similar shape so the problem with this in my opinion you can see the very top of the plant it stretches up and up and then the next level of flower off the tertiary branches I think that they're called ways yeah the difference between that and that is 12 inches so the intensity of light from there to there weakens greatly so while the top of the plant is getting lots of light lots of energy and thriving here we are 12 inches lower and and not getting quite as much and then down another four inches or so you get ones like this and like this so they're close to two feet away from the top of the plant so while the top will be getting a certain amount of light the bottom is not getting nearly as intense of light I suspect the flowers will develop and ripen differently I may have to harvest the top of the plant chop it halfway down and then let the lower half go a bit longer I'm not sure yet that's what happens with the untrained plant when you just let it go and do its thing now my buddy jalapeno he's old I mean old school and he's never been one to train his plants he just puts a seed in the dirt and lets the plant grow it knows how to do its thing but yeah the past year I've been watching a lot on YouTube learning a lot and I think training the plant is the way to go especially if you're indoors dealing with limited limited space outdoors is different of course and when dealing with auto flowers I wasn't sure how much LST they could take but yeah there was no issues just bend the main stem over and tie down the other stems or the other branches that come off of it and they had the plant plants are doing quite well yeah I guess that was all I really wanted to cover I wanted to keep this short and not waste too much of your time but just show you the difference between the trained and untrained plants and yeah briefly explain why I like to train mine so I don't think I'll be growing OTO flowers next run I'm pretty sure I'm going back to photoperiod plants once these ones are done and there will be plenty more training with those gonna be topping them and bending them yeah abusing them but anyhow that's in the future for now we'll put an end to this video so you can see this bloody skunk is coming along quite nice phone does not like to focus when I want it to so yeah there'll be more updates on that as those flowers develop get a bit prettier to look at and these two plants down here even though they're two and a half weeks different in age they're both close to the same same size of flowers yeah will be short time after that bloody skunk and then still got the Northern Lights too so yeah lots going on in the tent lots of updates coming so click Subscribe if you haven't already and yeah hit that Bell and you'll be sure to get notified whenever I do release an update yeah I guess we'll just end it there and I'll see you in the next one alright take care", "pYTx5of7wnE": "what's up guys back with update from the titan genetics test grow every single one of the star hazes is up out of the ground doing good looking good uh we only have two of the blue dogs that aren't out of the ground but we got this one here that is trying to come up you can see it right there right there here there she is but then everything else is up except for this one i'll give her a couple more days too this one was a a seed with barely any little tail out so but uh yeah everything is looking good so 10 out of 10 of the star hazes and we will have eight out of nine here soon of the blue dogs and hopefully nine out of nine here soon but uh just a quick update for you guys probably about oh i don't know between 24 and 36 hours that these popped all the way through so i'm stoked alright guys later", "4XqpFPiegek": "[Music] how's it growing everyone welcome to the second episode of beginner buds the channel for beginners by beginners last week we set up our tent and this week is all about popping beans so strap in and get ready because we're gonna learn all about germinating Otto flowers even better yet we've got something else that's pretty exciting as I'm sure some of you noticed last week beginner buds is a two-person team and you're about to meet the second half oh yeah and we've already made two mistakes and learned a few lessons so let's get into it and have some fun [Music] alright guys so for the first week the only thing we're gonna be giving our plants is water with that in mind we bought a pH meter and calibrated it fortunately for us our meter came with a few packets of powder that would set the pH of a specified amount of water to a precise number allowing the meter to know what it was looking at oh and by the way learn from our mistakes use distilled water when doing this step or you'll likely have inaccurate readings and have to recalibrate it later like we did of course the meter would be invaluable to both us and what we were trying to achieve for those of you who don't know cannabis is roughly 90% water that said water we've supplier plants with is about as important as it comes and if it's off it can significantly hurt the delicate life you're trying to bring into this world in order to prevent this one of the first and most important things you can look at is pH in short pH simply measures the acidity of your water now things are a bit different for soil so if that's what you plan to grow with I wouldn't use these numbers planning to grow using hydroponics we filled two jars with dechlorinated water set the pH to 5.5 and dropped our beans [Music] from there we stuck them into our grow tent with the lights off and let them sit for about 18 hours in darkness [Music] after taking the jars out of the tent we poured our seeds onto a paper towel but then we noticed something rather surprising come to find out the process had already begun our beans were already starting to pop but if you wanna travel then go along yeah what's the fooling us if I never know if you couldn't leave imma let you go as exciting as that was though it was time to wrap them back up and plunge them back into darkness the next step was to wrap them in a wet paper towel now for those of you who don't know you want the towel to be wet but not soaked in a puddle in fact you can roll the edges up like we did and soaked them down with a little more water allowing them to act like a candle lick keeping the entire surface wet for longer in the end you need to make sure they stay wet over the next 36 hours meaning that you'll have to soak them down from time to time with the hard work far from over the next step takes a bit of finesse at this stage the girls are at their most delicate meaning that you'll need to take the utmost care when you handle them when removing the paper towels go slow as we'd learn some of the roots had already started to attach themselves to the fabric of the cloth that said the feeling to see that these seeds were coming to life really was like no other [Music] the crown [Music] that you would stick around just like that it was time to get these ladies into their forever home five-gallon buckets full of cocoa quar before that could happen though we would have to do a little mixing after dumping the cocoa into totes and breaking up the large chunks that had compacted over time and transit eyeballing it we added about 10 or 15 percent perlite and got mixing [Music] with everything set we grabbed our germinated seeds and got ready to transplant now some people say that the seeds should be placed in your medium with the tap roots pointed down at a 45 degree angle but others suggest you just point them straight down that said we went with a ladder I know some people may say that I should've wore gloves here but there was actually a reason that I didn't of course I washed my hands before I started this entire process but in all reality I wanted as much control the situation as possible seeing how these are brand new babies they're extremely delicate and I didn't need a glove getting in my way and having something slip or god forbid break in order to eliminate the minimal risk of touching it with my hand now remember these problems we mentioned earlier one quickly surfaced but took us a few days to figure out although things had started out fine we started to notice quite a bit of positive air pressure in our grow tent we tried a few things including adjusting the settings on our inline fans but as it turns out we just needed to look up at first we thought the pre-filter was losing its color from the UV rays coming off our girl lights but that wasn't it at all come to find out the pre filters were jammed up with so much crap that it was restricting the airflow leaving our tent as a result air was being pushed in easier than it was being forced out to this day I'm not exactly sure if it was white dust from the perlite being blown around or the calcium in the water being vaporized into the tent long story short keep an eye on these for when they need to be cleaned all we did was run it through the washer on delicate and this was all that was needed to allow the fans to function like normal again one thing I just want to say here is that the cannabis community is one worth sharing even better yet connecting with other people over it can make it even more enjoyable that said I've happened to do just that at home so without further ado here she is ladies and gentlemen the other half of beginner buds with the tenth running these ladies breach the surface and took off running [Music] [Music] well almost all of them for some reason we ran into some trouble with one of our ladies knowing that they all germinated and seeing that one of the girls didn't come up for air we started to get concerned after carefully pushing away the cocoa we found what appeared to be a sick plant under the surface fortunately we got to it on time was able to reposition it so that was Leafs were exposed to the light and after a few days began to show signs of progress although the seed kicked out one of the biggest tap roots in the bunch I just couldn't let her take up so much room in the tent and opted to swap her out with a larger plant that I was growing in a smaller Cup seeing how I was able to get a hundred percent germination I didn't want to waste what I had and good thing I didn't sadly our biggest mistake was yet to come as a test let me ask do you see anything wrong with this picture unfortunately we didn't either that is until one of the ladies did this frantically searching for answers we hit the internet before learning that this is what they call stretching in essence this happens when your plants are starving for sunlight with a built-in self-defense mechanism cannabis seedlings will stretch themselves as tall as they can to get above nearby ground cover however they have no need to fight like this and it was entirely our fault and that's when it clicked we forgot to lower our lights seeing how the lights should be around 24 inches from the top of our canopy at this stage in their life we rushed to our tents and put them where they should have been all along quickly we brace the toppled girl and hoped for the best although she looks just fine we may have caused them some unnecessary stress and that's not something we're too happy about

learning catch you later guys you", "eGzcAnFvoK4": "today i'm showing you all of the secrets in brookhaven first of all you want to go and get to the sport location walk down here and head over to this location called the cleaners this is going to be a secret area which is for criminals only so if you've ever wanted to get into a top secret location follow these steps so you need to walk into here and then go down these steps that clearly says do not enter now you're probably just in a normal room however if you look upwards and see this light and then click on it it will actually open a top secret location now you can go and jump inside and seal the lid so no one else can follow you and now you're in a criminal location inside of brookhaven which is full of weapons hacking gear and c4 explosives you can literally do what you want in here and no one will know so if you're ever playing brookhaven and you want to find a secret area to go and like put all of your stolen money then you can definitely go and use this this place is by far one of my favorite secret locations you guys will want to wait until the end to find out all of them the best way to go and get to the spawn is by literally just going and pressing reset character then it will take you directly back to the spawn point for our next location we are back at the spawn and we are going to head straight forward there are a few secret areas inside of this brookhaven cemetery so if you want to go and head over to here there is a small area if you go and align up with this one and you walk forward slowly you will actually fall down into this area and there is a thing which you can interact with which makes some pretty scary sounds so do this at your own risk now that we are here the next one is actually very very close what you want to go and do is head over to the brookhaven hospital you want to go into the main entrance which is right here and go and head over to the front desk you'll then notice that there is a small like gap in the ceiling which does not sound very good but what you want to try and do is run and jump and get into it it might take you a little bit of time but trust me you can literally like get into this tiny little gap so this might take you a few attempts okay i finally got in that took me a few attempts now we're in this top secret laboratory area which is uh for experiments so if you know anyone who wants to be experimented on you can go ahead um i definitely wouldn't recommend going in this boot it's a bit scary but hey you want a top secret location then you should go to this area there is uh people in here i i don't even know how to describe this location it is very very strange that all of this is blocked off and a completely secret location inside of the game let me know if you know about this one okay i'm 100 leaving this place it seems very very strange so it's gonna go and reset our character to head over to the spawn to go and show the next top secret location inside of brookhaven the next secret location again you will want to go to the spawn and go and get yourself a vehicle out so i'm just trying to do a 360. what you'll want to do is go and turn left and head towards this big white snowy mountain so once you've gone and headed to there you'll want to climb the mountain yeah literally you're gonna have to drive up of this mountain which is uh gonna be probably easier than it it sounds let's be real so we just need to go and drive up it um to go and do so head over to this nice little um big slot right here then you can just kind of drive up of it which is kind of scarily easy to uh drive up a massive cliff but hey ho um what you're gonna go and do once you're at the top is there's a secret area which goes and gives you a drone so we're probably gonna have to go by foot now i don't think my vehicle can handle the rest of climbing up of a mountain but what you can go and do is go and get these really awesome drones and uh once you go and activate the drone you will literally start to go and fly away so you can start flying around the map and um have lots of fun by going and doing so so as you can see we are literally now a drone it says jump i'm not sure if that'll make me drop but as you can see we are now currently literally flying around brookhaven you can go and tell your friends whoa look i can fly and uh you can kind of like go anywhere really so if you want to like jump off and land on top of a building which you literally there's no other way of getting on top then this is a really cool way to go and do so it's also a good way to go and travel um so you can kind of see the whole map the brookhaven map is actually relatively small but it is does seem to be like full of lots of fun little secrets and different areas which not too many people know about so if we have a look around here there's like an abandoned house which we're gonna go and head over to now so it's like all the normal houses in a different area like around here but then this is just one abandoned house which does seem very bizarre so you can actually go and fly over to here um i guess flying is a pretty good easy way to go and travel to somewhere and a good way to explore so definitely let me know if you like going and using this drone and if you knew that it existed what's your favorite secret location as always if there is other things that you guys know that i don't know about then please let me know down below in the comment section do you know about a secret location which i haven't showcased in today's video then please let me know down below to go and help out the other people in the brookhaven community so this is the secret building there's not really too much to it um it's just kind of an empty random building in the middle of nowhere lastly we are going to go and rob the bank inside of brookhaven so to go and get to the bank you need to go over to the spawn and walk over to it over here as you can see the bank vault is actually closed what you want to go and do is grab this little swipe card right here i'm not sure what it's called but it's basically id to go and let you sneak up into this secret room you'll then want to go and walk through this door so without this key you can't go and walk through say we've got some money we can't go and walk through it you need this green key then as you can see we're at the brookhaven bank what you want to do is open up your backpack and click on this button right here which will go and give you some c4 what you then want to go and do with this is click near here so it goes and places and drops this and you'll want to step away so will get exploded and that a button will pop up which is green what you want to do is go and click on this button and it will then go and detonate it so i should probably put it a bit closer um please don't explode me okay i'm not sure if that worked we could try again and uh place it a bit closer this time all right we've just gone and exploded it i did kind of miss again um my aim is not great okay so it's kind of harder to place than i thought now we've placed it next to it we can go and exploit it and it will go and open up the broke haven bank you're now the most wanted criminal you can go and pick up the money but we already have the money so it's gonna go and do it it'll probably stay in the chat the bank alarm has been set off and if someone is pretending to be a police officer you're probably gonna try and be caught so you need to make sure that you don't look suspicious and that you are totally just a police officer as well and you'll totally get away alright let's see brookhaven get cash i'm not sure what you meant to do with the cash uh but oh no oh no this dude's the police this dude's the police am i getting he's he's a police um it wasn't me it wasn't me request a piggy back yeah okay sure he got me he's got me i'm not too sure he's gonna take me

brookhaven story video down below in the comment section thanks all for watching i hope you have a great fantastic day and i will see you guys next time bye [Music] you", "A5ZB0yT9_Xs": "so what are terpenes this has definitely become a major buzzword in the cannabis and cbd markets lately you can easily find products that say things like boosted terpene content added terpenes and so on you can even find pure terpene extract oils designed to give things like hemp oil extracts and vape liquids an authentic cannabis aroma and flavor but what exactly are these compounds and what role do they play in terms of the overall health effects of cannabis let's take a look before we get right into the meat of the content let me take a second to remind new viewers to subscribe right here to the way of leaf channel we offer expert-backed information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the question what are terpenes in the most basic sense terpenes are aromatic compounds that give cannabis its unique flavor and aroma you know how each different strain of cannabis has a different smell and taste well terpenes are largely to thank for that there are literally hundreds of different terpenes sometimes called terpenoids that exist in cannabis the prevalence of specific terpenes as well as the mixture of various terpenes in a given strain are what gives strains their own distinguishable smell taste and even their own unique effects in terms of the high they produce as we said a moment ago there are literally hundreds of different terpenes that exist not only in cannabis but also in other plant species as well here are some of the most common terpenes you'll find in different hemp and marijuana strands mircine potentially the most common cannabis terpene of all myrcin is found abundantly in most varieties of cannabis and hemp the terpene is known for its earthy almost dirt-like aroma and it exists naturally in things like mango and lemongrass effects-wise myrsin is known to have a positive impact on soreness and inflammation-related pain it's also been known to help tremendously with trouble sleeping pinene with an immediately recognizable scent of pine the pinene terpene is found naturally in things like orange rinds rosemary and other herbs and you guessed it pine trees this is a terpene that's found in high quantities in a lot of sativa strains in fact the presence of pinene could be what gives sativas their uplifting almost energy-inducing characteristics lowell as a wonderful floral terpene linda lowall is the dominant terpene in lavender ever wonder why lavender is used so commonly in aromatherapy to help treat things like stress anxiety and depression it's probably mostly due to linolo and its calming soothing effects limonene found abundantly in juniper peppermint and of course lemons limonene is another common cannabis terpene with a strong citrus aroma strains that are high in limonene have been known to boost energy levels elevate mood and even help with anxiety and depression karyophiline known as the spicy terpene karyophylene is the dominant terpene presence in black pepper and cinnamon as well as several popular cannabis strains the compound is known for its potent anti-inflammatory effects which can work wonders on things like joint pain and muscle soreness other less common terpenes include compounds like humulene and osamine but these are rarely the dominant terpenes in any one strain and little is known about their therapeutic effects admittedly a lot more research needs to be done if we're to better understand the specific role terpenes play with regard to cannabis effects on health one thing is for sure though the therapeutic effects of cannabis wouldn't be the same without them in fact numerous academic publications have observed a phenomenon known as the entourage effect the entourage effect describes how the presence of terpenes along with other compounds like flavonoids and cannabinoids work together to produce enhanced wellness effects this basically means that cannabis extract without terpenes probably isn't as effective when it comes to pain relief stress and anxiety relief inflammation relief and so on in fact a publication in the british journal of pharmacology made the suggestion that terpenes display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute to the entourage effect of cannabis-based medicinal extracts the study goes on to suggest that terpenes are likely to produce synergy in relation to cannabis ability to treat a variety of medical conditions including conditions like pain inflammation depression and anxiety addiction epilepsy and even fungal and bacterial infections like mrsa what does this all mean in a practical sense well some experts are hypothesizing that the cannabis market is going to see a huge influx of products marketed not only for their thc and cbd content but also for their specific terpene content for example if you're looking for a strain or extract to help you sleep you'll probably be able to choose a product in a year or two that's been genetically bred to contain high amounts of linolol the a4 mentioned study even references as much claiming that if proven cannabinoid terpenoid synergy will result in an extensive pipeline of new cannabis-based therapeutic products a separate 2018 study in the academic journal headache reproduced many of the observations made in the prior study researchers again suggested that the complete arrangement of compounds in cannabis including terpenes phytocannabinoids and other compounds all work synergistically to produce variations in health benefits variations in strain characteristics and even variations in a strains specific side effects they also suggest that advancing research on terpene activity in different strains will allow growers to cross breed phenotypes and eventually allow people to target specific symptoms and even specific diseases alright so on to the fun part how do you know which terpenes are dominant in which specific cannabis strains some dispensaries not many but some include chirping profiles on the various strains they sell to help you out we've provided a brief rundown of the most abundant terpenes in cannabis and which specific strains you're likely to find them in knowing and even memorizing this information will help you better choose a strain depending on the specific therapeutic effects you're wanting to achieve if you're looking for specifically high amounts of mircine you'll want to focus in on popular breeds like og kush nine pound hammer granddaddy purple and girl scout cookies other mere scene-rich strains include skywalker og remedy and one of our own personal favorites tanji mircine is known for its sleep inducing almost sedative qualities so keep this in mind when selecting a strain based on its therapeutic effects the pionene terpene known for its uplifting energy-inducing characteristics is found in high quantities in super popular strains like blue dream og cush and train wreck it's also the dominant terpene in other slightly harder-defined strains like hazeberry bubba kush and chemdawg91 the wonderfully aromatic chirping linaloal which has a brilliant floral aroma and calm soothing effects is most easily found in lavender cannabis strands this includes several different strains of skunk and afghani genetics as well as more obscure strains like fire og scooby snacks dosy dough and skittles if you're looking for strains that have the potential to help with stress anxiety and depression keep an eye out for breeds that are high in limonene this includes strains like ac dc a cbd dominant strain as well as cinex and super lemon haze the limonene terpene has a potent and very obvious citrus aroma which allows you to often tell an unidentified limonene dominant strain just by giving it a good smell last but not least karyophiline the spicy terpene can be found in high amounts in potent strains like death start and gorilla glue number four to a lesser extent it's also a dominant terpene in several kush varieties including bubba kush skywalker og kush and kosher kush this is a terpene that's known for its anti-inflammatory benefits so it would be a good choice if you're looking for pain relief or are suffering from things like aching joints or sore muscles well that just about wraps it up for our beginner's guide to what are terpenes if you feel we've left anything out or if you just have something you'd like to share

"ZVbmeMTo2IA": "for tonight skins initially started out as a really tiny idea over time fans have made skins into a large part of how you express yourself in game you see this dude now a normal person might say hey top 5 gaming isn't that just the homeless person and to them I say why yes yes it is but he's the protagonist and therefore has plot armor and has probably been through quite a lot I mean how many seasons in are we on the show wait what shoe exactly are we watching top 5 gaming duh as I was saying Jonesy has ran his cycle throughout the seasons and has evolved into the bot god yes ladies and gentlemen that is it the most trihard skin in the game I mean who's more of a trihard than old man Jonesy well maybe number 15 dynamo the dynamos skin is quite literally the face of try-hards right now every time you on social media anything like that there's like 50 people with the Dynamo as their profile picture and it is everywhere his baby goes for 1,200 V bucks and returns to the item shop pretty frequently you ever want to hop aboard the sweat train dynamo has had her run through the years as a go-to skin for sweats that want to stick out but at the same time not be a glowing dot on the map I mean just look at her she looks like she's pretty much made for try-hards if you see someone like mongrel mating this skin it pretty much instantaneously becomes one for the history books especially in a 42 elimination match like that one number 14 crystal if you've played fortnight into recent times and had fallen victim to try hearts you can build a three-story hotel in under a second and you may have noticed that a lot of them are using the crystals for a measly price of 800 feet bucks I'm not surprised that she's loved via all the sweats not to mention she appears in the shop like every month so she's not really that rare either I think it's safe to say that crystal is a sweaty player's fashion icon don't believe me just check out scope using her while making some wild grappler plays OH number 13 Deadpool now I know this skin is only recently committed but Deadpool essentially a free outfit which means that everybody and their dog is using it I mean we all know that Deadpool in the comics and films is ready to go commando at any time when it comes to fighting others so it makes sense that people want to replicate that inside a fortnight's but yeah you'll see all the sweats in arena using the Deadpool skin nowadays so it's no surprise that our buddy Wade Wilson made the list number 12 manic now the manic skin has been in the game for quite some time and ever since her release she's gonna go to skin for sweats worldwide you pick up the man skin for only 800 V bucks and although she's not particularly flashy she's amazing at not sticking out like a sore thumb which is reason why so many people use ur basically she is a super cool look without being over-the-top which seems to be the case for a lot of these trihard skins will see manic a lot especially in pro tournaments in fact scoped even use this very outfit when he lasered Booga number 11 renegade Raider renegade she's probably the Wreckers skin an olive for tonight right now or at least the most desirable you can only pick her up during season one from the limited time season shop she's never gonna return which is probably the reason somebody sweats user if you see a renegade Raider in your lobby just know they've either been around forever or they're enough of a try-hard to act we buy an account either way with people like t food using her to flex their OG status she's definitely up there with the sweatiest skins number 10 Kate Hayes is a skin that I don't actually see too much in public lobbies but she comes crawling right out of the woodwork when it's time for some arena or tournament play well she only came out first during the fortnight mares event last year she's quickly become a favorite for those who play the game 24/7 if you see a haze coming at you just assume they're about to turbo build on you faster than you can even say the word sweat she's a decent price though at only 1200 B bucks she also appears the item shop pretty regularly which might explain why her sweaty status is growing each and every day and that is really disgusting and stop sweating all over the place because that's gross and use disinfectant wipes number 9 Bora Bora is probably one of my favorite skins in the game right now just because of the way she's designed but she's also the favorite of many pro players and hardcore fans I mean I don't even know why but she seems to be extremely popular with the tribe artists then again she's yet another stylish uncommon outfit for believe under D bucks and it's the basic on comments against which seems to be papered by the pros number eight is you guessed it shocker skins get your towels ready it's about to get sweaty in here I'm pretty sure you clicked on this video expecting soccer skins to make the list because for so long the soccer skits were the absolute sweatiest out of this before you don't see them as often now but in arena and the default modes oh man there's still absolutely everywhere if I can define the word sweat with a single photo it would most definitely be the soccer skins yes not all people who wear the soccer skins are insanely trihard let's be honest they kind of are number seven spark blah the spark plug is a pretty awesome looking skin overall and maybe that's why so many people both noobs and sweats love using her so many try-hards and pro players equip her in their locker simply because of her fantastic design the skin is 1,200 V bucks and is definitely one to pick up if you're trying to prove that sweaty status especially because it's used by pro players like misfits clicks who are stupidly good at the game that's until you see number six which is the recon expert oh my god oh my goodness hide your kids hide everyone this is no one is safe from this person if you have a recon expert in your locker consider yourself incredibly lucky this skin has only ever been in the item shop twice and they were both in November of 2017 this means she hasn't reappeared in the item shop for almost three years and it seems they have no plans to bring her back because of this recon expert is one of if not the rarest item shops skin in history of corner horse of you're trying hard who's been playing the game since day one for three years you're gonna want to show off that fact and what better way to do so than to equip this outfit that way people just have to look at you to know you're amazing it for tonight in the unlikely case she ever does return she's only twelve hundred bucks so expect a ton of people to pick her up number five bullseye bullseye is probably one of the most bland uncommon skins out there at least in my opinion she somehow keeps proving herself to be the queen of try-hards you can watch any streamer or pro player and I can pretty much guarantee they own or have used this skin at some point in fact when tea food the king of defaults bought his first skin in years it ended up being the bullseye and it was pretty much this which sparked the trend of using and naturally it's only eight hundred V bucks I mean what the heck is up with all these skins being 800 feet bucks our try art stupor for a good-looking skin I think not oh hey will you look at that it's number four banner brigade there's nothing you can spot more in a tournament than the banner brigade skins these things were everywhere during events like the World Cup last year and because of the way you can customize them people love to make some super sweaty variants admittedly you can get some really nice-looking combos with these things but if I had a penny for every time the try-hard eliminated me with this skin I would be retired by now voice or maybe I'm just bad at the game wait a second that might actually be it number three the ghoul trooper school trooper isn't as used nowadays as she used to be but she's still considered one of the sweaty skins out there especially with that pink alternate style before she rear elites for nightmares we'll trooper had the title of rarest skin in fortnight well that is before the crown went to renegade writer and recon expert of course now she's since been re-released in the item shop and all the try-hards who didn't get her back in 2017 have picked her back up and began using her again granted not as much now as they did during Halloween but you can still spot one or two every time you load up a machen and if you spot a pink one just run seriously you're crazy just get out of there number two dark bomber the dark bomber skin is up there as one of the sweatiest skins in all of Portland comparable to the Terminator not just because of the sheer amount of try-hards who use her but also because of how serious skin she is may sound weird but there are just some outfits important eyes that look incredibly intimidating and the dark bomber is one of those skins also sticking with the theme of these skins being cheap dark bombers 1200 v bucks and a dark rarity while you might associate dark bomber with face weight there are definitely some other people in the competitive scene and sweats out there who make plays just as insane as he does I just want to say it's so crazy to me how a competitive player can start using a skin and all of a sudden all of their fans will start using that skin too I think that's honestly one of the coolest things ever but moving on to number one we've got red Jade last but not least the red Jade has to take our number one spot here because in our opinion she's simply the sweaty skin in all of for tonight right now I mean all you got to do is just the scrim or a game of zone Wars and you'll probably find like 10 red J's in every match now we're not saying she's used by all the sweats but she's definitely up there and of course what better way to fit the pattern and to also cost 800 B bucks so the next time you see someone using red Jade herbs think to yourself yep this person definitely ambassador I hard and you might want to try to avoid them and maybe think twice about picking a fight with one that is unless of course you are the bot god yes number one was just a hoax ladies and gentlemen that's right they're true number one spot is old man Jonesy how old is he can you guess his age smash like if you guessed his age correctly can we hit more likes than we ever have before on this video is good 15 most tryhard skins

cannabis grow Channel on YouTube! Not today is that the official start a week\n9 for my low stress training Autoflower grow serious. So I will be continuing with flushing those\nblue Amnesia plants and I will continue also with the nutrients schedule for the tangerine\ndream's and hopefully they will be ready for flushing as well pretty soon here. So before I get started with today's video\nI want to remind you guys that if you are trying to start your own cannabis grow at\nhome for the first time or you have already started and are struggling and need some help. I do offer one-on-one grow guidance where\nI'll hope you each day over the phone and kind of guide you along with what to do to\nyour plants, so you get the best results. If you are interested I'm currently offering\na free trial to this service as well, so just check out my contact info Down Below in the\ndescription, and feel free to hit me up for info on how to sign up for that. No I don't want to forget to remind you guys\nto check out our merch on the GreenBoxGrown.com website under MERCH and SMOKE, and now that\nyou know what we are doing and today's video Let's Get start with day 1 of the week! Alrighty Growers we are out here in the garage\nfor day 1 of the week, and you can see the buds on those Tangerine Dream plants are still\nfattening up really well each day. The buds on the blue Amnesia plants are not\nreally growing in size anymore, they are kind of fattening up a little bit, but most growth\nis pretty much finished at this point. And the trichomes are pretty much just maturing\nas time goes on. Again I am still flushing these Buds and that's\ngoing to be another week and a half and that is really just to clean out the buds and to\nget all of those nutrients and minerals out of there or whatever it is that is Left Behind\nfrom the nutrients you use. And that way you have a cleaner better-tasting\nsmoke in the end. Now here is a good shot on the Tangerine Dream\nplants and I'm going to bring in light so you guys can see better. But let's see if we can get it to focus, right\nso you can see in there still growing in size and the hairs are still all white and standing\nup. They are starting to curl up towards the buds\nhere and there, but not too much so just going to let them keep growing, and you can see\nthey are starting to grow towards each other and connect almost, but they are definitely\ngrowing in size and getting larger. So yesterday was a plane pH watering and obviously\na continuing for the flush, of these guys, so I'm going to wait a few more days or at\nleast until tomorrow before I water them again and in the meantime just keeping temperature\nin that range of 67 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. And then the humidity around 50 to 55%. All right guys I will see you in 24 hours\nfor your next update. What up Growers we are back 24 hours later\nfor day 2 of the week, and I just checked the soil and the plants are ready for their\nnext watering so that's going to be another plain pH water at 6.3, and I've got that mixed\nup right here so I'm just about to give that to them. And that is the second plane pH watering since\nthe last nutrient feeding for the Tangerine Dream plants, and of course I think this is\nthe third watering since the beginning of the flush for the Blue Amnesias. So not going To show you guys the watering\ncuz you of course I've seen this several times before, but I am giving them over a gallon\nof water each per plant not like a gallon and a quarter but more like a gallon and 1/8\nMaybe. So really a good amount of water and getting\naround 30 to 35% runoff out of all of them, and you can see what the blue Amnesia buds\nthey aren't going to get much bigger, but they are just kind of finishing up with their\ntrichome development and letting them finish up to those perfect levels. Now these buds on the Tangerine Dream are\nso fattening up as you can see, looking really good of course and nice and Frosty. And those trichomes are really packing on,\nbut they are mainly milky right now still some cloudy like a little bit 1% 2% Amber\nbut not much more than that. And the same goes for the Tangerine Dream\nin the back here. All right guy so I actually wanted to show\nyou the Blue Amnesia Buds in the back here as I haven't given you a close look on those\nlately. And those are really looking really good,\nso let me give you guys a quick close up! And let's see if I can give you a good shot\nso you can see his nice orange hairs and bulbous like buds that are curling in. You can see up close how Frosty it is really\ngetting and I mean let's see here, all right so here are some good shots of the bud So\nyou can see it's kind of a weird angle but this is really the easiest way to get that\nfor y'all. And that one right there is really looking\nnice so very excited to smoke these in the very near future. So yeah I just wanted to show you guys that\nand that is it for today's update, so I will be back in another 24 hours for day 3 of the\nweek! All right guys here we are another 24 hours\nlater for day 3 of week 9, and you can see I left the purple lights on today just so\nyou can get a different look at the buds since I haven't done a shot with these on and awhile. So buds are still developing really nicely\nand fattening up on the Tangerine Dreams, and I am still continuing with flushing on\nthe Blue Amnesia plant. Now the blue amnesia's are a little bit ahead\nso I'm thinking I might shorten that flush. Buy a few days and just go for a 10-day flush\nopposed to a 14-day flush. But we will finish out this week just since\nthis was the start of flush and then we will go from there and decide what to do. No I'm going to give you guys a quick close\nup on the buds, and then I'm also going to give you guys a nice look at the Tangerine\nDream trichomes as I haven't given you an update on those in a minute. So here is the first of all the Tangerine\nDream main Cola here in the front plant, looking really good and filling out. you can see those hairs are curling and more\nand more and turning more orange which is a sign of getting closer to maturity, or full\nmaturity that is. You can see all of the other side colas are\ndoing really well also and are almost the same size as this guy up here. And then the Tangerine Dream in the back is\nlooking good as well, fattening up well I guess you could say as big as the one in the\nfront it has some more white hair standing up at this point though. So a sign that it does have a little bit further\nto go in terms of flower. But like I said I will probably be doing another\nnutrients eating or two for the tangerine dream's quick look at the Blue Amnesia in\nthe front. As always the All Star Of the group! And down below those buds are looking really\nbig and Frosty and are even getting pretty fat, but at this point it's just about flushing\nand not really getting more growth going on. And same with the blue Amnesia in the back\nso let me give you a good shot of that. Really nice looking buds nice and dance with\nthose really fat curly hair is going in. And you can see they're just going to be really\nnice tight nugs and I can't wait for the Harvest video of the series cuz that is going to be\nreal nice. Alright so now let me give you guys I look\nat these trichomes on the Tangerine dreams right here. Alright guys so I've got my scope right here\nmy macro lens that I will be clipping on to my iPhone. And now that we have our trichome vision on,\nlet's take a look at this mean Tangerine Dream Bud right here in the front. and this is obviously the slow mo clip so\nyou guys can get a better idea of how they look because in regular speed pretty tricky\nto see. From what I can see just filming right now\nin regular speed it looks like lots of white and milky but not really any clear trichomes\nleft. And I'm not really seeing any amber yet, but\nwhen it's in slo-mo I'll be able to have a better look and a better idea. But there is some good shots for you guys,\nalright in there we are that is the bud we were just looking at with a try comes under\nthe scope. Pretty much all milky looking and hopefully\nare going to start turning Amber and at that point is when I will begin the flush. So that is it for today's video on the low\nstress training Autoflower series, but I will be back of course in 24 hours for your next\nupdate. Alright peace guys! Alright guys we are back for day 4 of the\nweek, and the plants are ready for their next plane pH watering. Of course that is a flushing for the blue\namnesia's, but that just means plain pH water at 6.3 for all for plants. And I will be really soaking all of them with\njust over a gallon as usual, I will not be showing you guys the watering as usual again\nas you've already seen me do that plenty of times and it's just going to be the same routine. But what I will do today is give you guys\nsome close-ups on those buds so you can see how they are developing. So again this is that Tangerine Dream that's\nbeen developing in the front here on that main Cola and I'll show you all the way down\non those top so you can see how they are developing underneath as well. Everything is looking really nice and sunny\nat those orange hairs going and curling in towards the bud. And getting bigger and frosty so these are\ngetting pretty close almost ready for their flesh to start and again here is that blue\nAmnesia in the front for you guys to see. \u00a0But yeah that's part of the girls kind of\nslow because all we are doing is Flushing the plants or watering them at this point,\nnothing too much else going on especially with the ones that are pretty much finishing\nup the flowering stage. So it's kind of just a waiting game at this\npoint, and yeah I'll be back in another 24 hours later of course for your next update. And in the meantime just make sure your temperature\nand your humidity or staying on point because you don't want any drastic changes happening\nin the tent! Alright guys we are back for day 5 of week\n9 and the Tangerine Dream here in the back right is getting a lot of nice Bud development\nas of the last few days here. So just wanted to give you guys a close up\non that and I just wanted these guys I think it was yesterday, with their plane pH watering\nso they are all still really good in terms of that. And no need to water today. But yeah let me show you guys the development\nwe are having over here with the Tangerine Dream in the back right. So you can see those white hairs are mostly\ncurled in at this point and have oranged, but they still have a couple white ones up\ntop there but you can see it's getting real Frosty. And like this main Cola right here it is getting\nreally dense and is fattening up way nicely on the underside of the canopy here. So really excited for this growth, this recent\ngrowth and sometimes you'll notice with Bud growth. And here's the Tangerine Dream in the front. Sometimes you'll notice with Bud growth that\nit kind of comes in spurts, so maybe you'll notice your buds aren't growing very much\nfor a few days or a few weeks, and then all the sudden you'll have a couple days of massive\nbud growth. And that is just depending on the Strain and\nthe genetics, some are consistent and grow a lot or just grow a consistent amount each\nday. And I would say that the blue Amnesia is definitely\ngrew like that because it was a noticeable amount each day, and then with this Tangerine\nDream strain it definitely seems like it comes and goes and kind of spurts. So here is your guys day 5 update, no need\nto water like I was saying, next watering will be a nutrient feeding but I will give\nyou an update on that when it is time. I almost forgot to mention that we are getting\npretty close here with harvesting the blue Amnesia plants. We have been flushing for about a week now\nand I may go another half week to a full week I'm not really sure. Because they are coming out really nicely\nand are just about at that sweet spot for harvesting. So I'll be finishing for sure this week with\nthe flush and then I will be reevaluating the blue amnesia's, so maybe harvesting at\nnext week's video. Or I guess I will be back in another 24 hours\nper day 6 of the week, peace! What up peeps we are back for day 6 of the\nweek, and the plants are ready for their next watering so it's going to be the continued\nflush for the blue Amnesia is here and then the Tangerine dreams are ready for their nutrients\nfeeding. \u00a0This will actually be the last nutrients\nfeeding for the grow, and then I will start flushing the Tangerine dream's as well. So in today's video I'm not going to show\nyou guys the nutrients feeding just because you guys have seen me do it so many times\nbefore, but I will show you the mix I am using. And then we will check out the trichomes on\nthe Tangerine Dream plants, so I can show you how they look or what signified to me\nthat they are ready to start their flush just about. Alright so first let's check out the feeding\nschedule I will be using for today, I will be following the week 10 mix on the fox farm\nDirty Dozen schedule, so you'll see I've got three teaspoons of the Big Bloom, 2 teaspoons\nof the tiger bloom, three of the bembe and then .25 of the Cha Ching. So it's a pretty simple one, and then I pH\nat 6.3 of course, and I will be doing this one at full strength since the last one, and\ndon't forget about that cal-mag with 1 teaspoon per gallon of water as that is really important\nalso. So there is the feeding schedule, pH it at\n6.3 and then it's just going to be playing pH watering from now on since I'm just flushing\nthese blue and he's your plants up here and back here. All right guy so I've got the macro lens on\nmy iPhone so now let's get a close-up on this trichomes, on the Tangie dream in the front. Again this is the main Cola or main Bud up\ntop in the middle or that main cola if you will, let's see if I can get a steady shot\nit's kind of hard with the fans going. But you will notice almost all of the hair\nis have curled in and turned orange, so that is one sign that is getting close to full\nmaturity, and then of course just looking at this trichomes to see that they are all\nmilky and then some are starting to get Amber. It looks like we are getting that because\nI am seeing that in the steadier shot here. \u00a0It's a little bit lighter on that Amber\nside it's not quite the 5% that I like, but these buds have been in flour for a long time\nfor autoflowers, so I'm going to wrap this one up and get her flushed pretty soon. So I will be doing that final nutrient feeding\ntoday, And then next week is when I will do that Sledgehammer flush to kick off that two-week\nor one-and-a-half weak flush for the Tangerine Dream Autos. So there is that big bud in the front there\nand then in the back there is that guy is well. What up Growers so we are back here for the\nlast day of week 9, and the plants are looking amazing as always! So at this point they grow series I'm pretty\nmuch just going to be flushing the plants, since we did the last nutrients feeding there\nfor the Tangerine Dream as I mentioned. And it's just going to be flashing these guys\nfor the next week or week and a half for the Tangerine Dream and I'll be doing it a few\ndays in the next week for the blue amnesia's and then I'll be harvesting them. But yeah that is pretty much going to be it\nfor this gross Series so the bud will develop a little bit further for the remainder of\nthis video series, but it's mainly like I keep saying just going to be me flushing the\nnutrients out of there, so we get a nice healthy bud to smoke. And it's also going to taste a lot better,\nso that is you know the importance of flushing when you are in soil or some sort of Coco\nchoir like medium. You want to flush it because that gets them\nnutrients out of the plant and there is actually a build up in there overtime just because\nyou know you are constantly feeding it those different supplements. So flushing that out makes it so you don't\nhave to smoke Does nutrients and it \u00a0makes for a much tastier bud! So I am thrilled with how this blue Amnesia\nis coming out, it is just super Frosty and smells amazing, they all smell really Citrusy,\nespecially this Tangerine dream's because it's got those Tangi genetics in it. This guy back here I swear, I had had my hands\non it was just kind of touching the buds and smelling them up close and afterwards I was\nlike I was just peeling an orange or something, it was a strong fruity smell and I love it\nwhen it smells like that! So really stoked like I am staying on the\nprogress of these Buds and how they are coming out over all. Very excited to start harvesting them next\nweek as well. Next week will be the last week for the blue\namnesia's and then the week after that will be the final week of the grow for the Tangerine\nDream, and then I will have some videos on the harvesting as well as the curing and drying\nprocess. And here's just a good close-up for you guys\non the main Cola there of that Tangerine Dream. And then let's see I'll try and get one more\ngood close-up to see if you guys can see those trichomes and just how dense they are, it's\na shield of Frost! Nice aerial view for you guys, alright peace\nguys! Alright GreenBox Growers that concludes week\n9 of the low stress training Autoflower grow series. And like I was saying I will be back for week\n10 where I will be starting the flush for these Tangerine Dream plants, and I will be\nfinishing up the flush for the blue amnesia's and harvesting them in this coming week. \u00a0all right guys so as always if you enjoyed\nthe video, please smash that thumbs-up button and don't forget to comment below with your\nfeedback.

it's the first one with me being back in California and let me just say that it feels great being back here ultimately because the weed in New York is unfortunately just not on par with the weed in California and one of those main reasons why that is is cuz New York does not have dizzy so I've been very very excited over the past couple of months to get back to California because my favorite brand stays stays II came out with a whole bunch of new stuff right lately I mean they have this cannabis derived terpenes they have the liquid live resin they opened up the store in downtown LA so shout-out to them they've been doing big [ __ ] these past couple months I mean literally they've been doing so much so shout-out to them um so yeah this video is just me trying this this is I cannot say that this is the first is I had since I've been back because I got one the day my flight came in I stopped that la coached on over in East Valley Boulevard in LA East LA rather and I just got some hardcore OGS some [ __ ] that I've always had I've always you know one of my go-to but this is the first one of their newer stuff that I've had so this is gonna be a little review on the ghost train haze Stiggy you know the secured all at a scratch-off eighty-three point six two percent THC four point three seven milligrams of CBD this badge is brand-new 11 619 which means that this was this is brand new [ __ ] so I got further ado let's crack this up open and give it a shot because I am excited plus I'm about to go on a walk what better strand or category weed to smoke than sativa when going outside and going on in a little adventure right a little push in still having a hard time with this packaging because I'm used to the other you [ __ ] kidding me right now you [ __ ] kidding me right now alright back at that broke I don't know if I did that right or wrong but there are goals also when I was here last time they did not have this sticker they didn't have this this packaging everything is new everything is brand new pop it out first time let me dry headed see what that's like pardon me I don't have to setup like I usually have it so for now just work with me guys nothing to distinctive ghost train is see now I'm from New York back in a certain time that's all you can find was haze and it shows like it's hard to even describe the taste of it I doubt this is gonna taste anything like it but we'll see haze Loki one of my favorites so since the haze this is the car car that I came in with nothing left in that so on to the next let's get it go stray haze by Suzy we got two blinkers back-to-back I think it different the way oh geez that's two blinkers you're gonna have to give me a minute y'all that's that go straight A's that [ __ ] hitting this video is for patients 18 and older but I should have said that [ __ ] five minutes ago this [ __ ] hit Dan all right well that's all I got for y'all man that [ __ ] hit they got a good hazy it don't taste like the haze like ruffle let me just say that first and foremost but that's not to say that this ain't bad ghost rain haze I'm not getting the euphoric feeling that [ __ ] hitting no I listen mm-hmm that [ __ ] hit so I mean listen this is this is the listen dumb there see they got all it up trying to look cute for this [ __ ] I mean I mean not is [ __ ] see this she got me acting funny right now she got me acting loopy y'all give it a shot man I mean it's Disney's really not gonna do you wrong but I mean I don't I like that strong manner or the pineapple Express or dislike them shirts but and make sure they go to that new digi store downtown LA that [ __ ] is beautiful man yo I'm a highlight shot bro it's been real thanks for watching the video make sure to look out for more and just keep it going it's glad to be back in Cali baby", "Yei0tdCsZD0": "[Music] what I've used is car m.d. and I'm making a video from four thousand hey mister did you say Hayes and check it out so right now I got the camera [ __ ] enormous definitely definitely stretching a lot more than I actually anticipated but uh stepping on my bucket here so I can actually be on top of the canopy but here's what it's looking like today on day 29 guys I have to say this is very very slow production for anything that I'm used to see in the past or you know being big see but nonetheless you know this canopy is just out of control and there are a bud sides everywhere so I'm really gonna let it go the distance because I think that's still definitely going to turn out to the other ear aborting grow the trichome development on these things stop standing already for the fact these buds are so small [Music] off to come in and make a separate video for you guys because I've actually seen some trichomes actually developing up and down the stocks team notes so it's been just getting pretty crazy in here even this right here being my tallest branch it was probably upwards of reaching you know six feet nine six pretend something like that you know definitely there in six now if you tall if you snap right there is mountain at six so you know the way things are going in here is a very consistent study against my best way to put it but you know nonetheless I'm really happy with it you know I'm not I'd have to say that I am just absolutely shocked at the stretch that these plants have you can see it kind of got the reflectors all adjusted individually here and the only other real change I me was I just added up a couple sticky traps been seen hanging from whites just to you know keep the bugs away from all the buds here in the last few weeks you actually but like several weeks but anyway so let's see here on refer to my chart here I think on Friday we changed the reservoir actually Thursday excuse me we gave them the near eyes and and what we went with reservoir was 400 milliliters of sexy bloom amb big bud from Nirvana and Nirvana excuse me all advance nutrients then 250 milliliters of silica blasts from the janitor and a million the uptake design the potash and the doctor here Canseco and 950 so basically your life repeat that reservoir big fun the only reason I with the potash in there was simple just because it was the last of what I had a big button I have a lot of the potash remaining from the psycho girl so we're gonna definitely be using that and then basically she's going to continue to repeat that reservoir right there for a while you know at least until I see these plans start to finish and I definitely want to take advantage you know as long as I can since I think this is going to probably the first grow real asipi that I've ever had to let go longer than since these 65 days my longest grow to date was a blue dream which I think took down a lot of 64 days 65 something like that but I think this actually might hit the 70s just you know eivol in it at this given moment but who knows you know I've just been shocked just like it would you touch the way it finished off but Oh chica she's probably had more but on them than these but I definitely think these are going to be much better in terms of quality so yeah you know like I said suspend discount reduce control with the feeding system been using my recycle timer right here it's set to feed every four hours and the lights are on for about 45 seconds which gives them just a nice good watering and but the consumption on these plants is particularly high you know with the og fishes that I had all three times but at one point you know they were I would that much water but you can see that even with getting that much you know they still dry off quite a bit you know between waterings and the stocks on these plants are all just huge and so they're definitely continuous water which is good you know I'm happy about that but you know with the drip system working properly this garden has just really been automatic so it's been really nice I mean this canopy is so dense that I can't get in here really hanging on my co2 generator because I do have all my new controllers and fans all my equipment for all the other rooms basically they're sitting here waiting for each grow to be done but you know I think this grow definitely could have seen some really awesome results with little co2 but I don't really think it's worth it's trying to just temporarily install all the [ __ ] just to have to reinstall later you know I I also think that this will be able to give me a good reason to grow this strain again in the future we'd be using co2 and really be able to have good results to compare against so that's basically you know I repeat basically all my growth with the affair with the exception of the mixed strain grows no longer going to be doing that or getting guys leading one string at a time and reflowing them out you know co2 the one I'm shooting for next after this grows them is you know I'm room a or I only had 12 blue dreams that were this size I was getting about 2 pounds per light just between the 12 that I wanted to try a full room see if I'd be able to get some routine 8 and 10 pounds using co2 on a full room but that is still in the future it's really going to come down to clone number since I am going through a time where I'm not doing very much refreshing my mother plants and using my using my mother room has and just my flowering at the moment so that's basically all I really got for this video guys I'm gonna hop in the back and crawl under here and let you guys take a look at what this game it looks like from the other side so you read back alright guys so here is what the back of like you can see that there's a one short plant there kind of a shorter Flannery these plans kind of wrap around at least you know they made out the cello setting but geez plans over here all these places changed probably closer to drink crazy all these by definitely stuffs are going to be quite right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "RS41kF2eg68": "so in today's video we're going to be looking at manic panic in the color voodoo blue it was a little bit of a fiasco opening up the container so i have some blue on me don't mind that so my swatches are human hair swatches but the only one that's going to be virgin hair is the number four black swatch the rest have been chemically dyed or bleached at some point in their existence my swatches are labeled one through twelve but that is not synonymous with hair levels i'll be doing uh like close-ups and pictures near the end of the video so the numbers just help us keep track of each swatch one is pink i kind of wanted to see if it would turn more of like a purpley blue over the pink two is gray three is a natural red four is black and then from four to eleven we have a range that goes to platinum blonde and then number twelve is like a toned version of number eleven so to start i'll be taking the dye from the container and i'll be putting it at the top of each swatch some people do like to dilute their dyes so i'll do a diluted version at the bottom of each swatch as well please keep in mind everyone's hair is different which means everyone's hair could take dye differently so please just use my video as a reference as to how this could possibly turn out for you also i've noticed that monitors can definitely change how a dye looks especially the undertones so please keep that in mind as well [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] for the diluted section we're gonna be doing a six to one ratio today and that is six parts of diluter to one part dye if you're unsure what diluter is um the easiest answer i can give you right now is that it just basically lightens the color of the dye and if you're wondering what i use i just use a plain white conditioner [Music] so [Music] so i'm gonna let these sit for about three hours i will then rinse them out and when they're dry i will meet you back here the number one and number two swatch actually look very similar to each other they both pull very cool tone in comparison to the more blonde swatches toning your hair will get you a slightly more cool toned result as well but it isn't quite as cool tone as like the pink and gray swatch so for comparisons i wanted to start with a manic panic i've not officially done atomic turquoise but i think that would be my first choice if i did have that option after midnight sounds like it wouldn't be similar but um for your guys sake i thought i would just compare it so you can see the slight similarities in the two this is comparable to number 12. number eleven number ten and number nine so firstly i don't think after midnight is quite as pigmented as the voodoo blue i'm not like a i don't know chemistry and colors and stuff but from what i've noticed is that cooler tone colors especially like cool toned blues tend to not be as pigmented and the colors with green in them tend to be a little bit more pigmented so that could be why now when i did the after midnight i was still doing two separate diluted parts so this is diluted and then this is even more diluted so i thought i would throw a piece of paper on top really quick so that it's a little less distracting okay so hopefully you can see on camera but after midnight doesn't seem to run quite as dark and is a little bit more blue looking um especially in comparison i feel like the after midnight makes voodoo blue look even more green the reason i wanted to compare these is actually more so for the diluted sections so when i diluted after midnight i noticed that it did start to pull a little bit more of like a greenish blue so after midnight isn't so cool tone blue that once it fades it'll stay looking blue it may turn like a greenish blue um i think the best way to combat that would be to tone your hair first because our tone swatch here even though it does have a very very slight greenish blue look um it definitely leans more cool tone especially compared to the voodoo blue you can see that this is more cool toned but it's a little bit harder to tell on the 11 10 and 9 swatch to me the diluted section almost looks like a less pigmented version of voodoo blue so if you're thinking that after midnight's going to be a super cool tone blue that's not quite it but it is a lot more cool toned than something like voodoo blue the other comparison i wanted to do today is from arctic fox in the color aquamarine this is comparable to number 12. this is comparable to number 11. this is comparable to number ten and this is comparable to number nine so again i was diluting two separate parts for these so i'm gonna put another piece of paper on top so far from the dies that i've done aquamarine is actually going to be the most similar to the voodoo blue i feel like they look the most similar on the 12 and 13 toned swatch and funny enough i feel like on the blonder swatches the aquamarine actually looks slightly more green which i find very interesting because i always thought aquamarine was a blue and i'm not saying it's a green but i didn't realize it had that much green in it i guess and then i did want to compare the diluted sections as well so the middle diluted section is probably going to be more similar to the bottom of voodoo blue and honestly i feel like it's a lot harder to tell the difference on the diluted section they both have that like greenish blue look and again they look the most similar on the tone swatch here i do have to say again that on the blunder swatches the aquamarine does seem to pull slightly more green but you know honestly if there was two different people who dyed their hair with both of these um and let's say they both have like the same porosity of hair right they were standing away from each other there was a good chance i would think that they would have the same hair color so at this point it's really just preference maybe if you like one brand more than the other or one is more easily accessible for you they're pretty much dupes for each other so now i'd like to get into the before and after clips those and anything at the end of this video will be done in natural lighting and i'm sure as you know but recreating the exact same environment with natural lighting on different days can be a little bit difficult so if anything looks slightly off that is probably why [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i hope

to refer to as the church flashback Bible scene look I'll have a more elegant title in in the video I hope but basically when I came up with this look I thought man I could see that totally being used to you know be played at some you know churchy things some Bible verses over it and and so I thought I'd make a tutorial on how to do it because there's some interesting stuff going on here so without further ado let's hop into DaVinci Resolve you see I've got you know very appropriate a hand it's my hand going on just I was playing about some stuff and this is a clip I decided to use so the first thing we're going to do is I shot this in raw because like I said experimenting with stuff and you see this does not look like Blackmagic film gamma and this is a problem that lots of people have when working with raw footage from the Blackmagic Cinema Camera so how do you make this look like nice creamy film footage well you change this over in our Camera Raw settings you change decode using project to clip and then you can change your color space from rec 709 to BMD film boom million percent improvement looks so much better now so now from here we're just going to change our raw settings just going to increase the exposure some since that was a little bit underexposed I'm gonna move the shadows down just a bit I'm not going to make this too contrast you right off the bat and bring the highlights up some because it is a dreamy sort of flashback ish look gonna bring the saturation up some that looks pretty nice I'll give it a little bit of color boost just to make it pop crank up some mid-tone detail and some sharpness and we're good to go and when you're using raw Clips you can select a bunch of Clips and apply what you just did here to all of them or you can do it in your project settings either one is fine the next thing that we're going to do is add a new node and we're going to go over to our qualifier window and we're going to just select right here in the palm of my hand I'm going to hit shift 8 so you can see what you're doing and I'm going to do is I'm going to sort of try my best to sharpen up just sort of hand parts so I'm going to like it's pretty good selection right now I want a little bit less stuff in there so what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the high soft just a little bit and drag the low up some will soften that guy out a little bit too and that's starting to look good also going to denoise the selection and clip the black denoise clip black just to sort of get rid of that narced enos that was going on down here we can I clip black even a little bit more and now you've got a reasonable selection it shift h again to go back to where we were and you can see sort of what we're doing here see boom there it is so I'm going to brighten this up just a bit just because and then the main thing that I did this for was to be able to sharpen it up so you just click over to sharpen and bring this down just a bit so great we got that going for us the next thing that we're going to do is add another qualifier inside another node and we don't need to worry about actually selecting stuff just unselect hew and unselect saturation and the purpose of this guy is to blue my highlights out just so they look a little more dreamy I'm just going to bring the lows up and we're going to hit shift H again so you can see what we're doing and right about there well soften these guys out more selectively and we will blur this selection just so we can have stuff sort of spillover on to each other so great next we're going to do is gain this bad boy up nice oh I love how da Vinci handles blooming stuff because that was just gorgeous see that again is to replay that's 32-bit colors are working for you man okay so that's pretty good the next we're going to do is Exley you go ahead and blur this guy out there it's good I'm going to hit a shift eight Sun do that and we can see oh look how glowy that it's just a little bit - glowy bring this guy down some but you can see before and after it's definitely very flashback II the next thing that we're going to do is begin sort of coloring this some so I want to go with the a sort of warm sepia ish type look so I'm just going to move the offset to the warmer side of things all right about then I'm going to overdo it a little bit so I can bring the saturation down let's overdo it a little more pinky there we go bring the saturation down Jesus still another little smidgen I can see some noise in this selection so let me just go back real quick to the qualifier oh just blur the selection some just a little bit nicer to work with there we go so now you can see we've got a pretty good looking look here like I could definitely see you know Bible verses or something going on over that I might even warm that up just a little bit more yeah that's looking good and we'll go back to our primary grade and we'll contrast it up just a bit more nice that's a little much so I guess I didn't want to there we go the next thing we're going to do is we are going to add a vignette let's just add another new node go to our windows create a circle window and scale it way up and we're going to move around feather that guy out like a bunch then I'm gonna make sure to invert this guy so we're only selecting outside so you can see this is what we have now and this is what we had before so we just want to affect the outside parts of going to go over to our curves normal curves I'm just going to bring that guy down some and we're also going to desaturate it just a little bit because whenever you contrast down and curves it tends to bring some more saturation out of the image that's just the way that the math works somehow just as long as you're conscious of that you know you should be good go back here and we'll make this a little bit more crouching in because I mean church videos tend to be a little bit bold stylistically we're going to hit alt s and create another new node and then we're going to create another circle window we're going to use this to sort of highlight part of the hand so we already did some secondaries but this is going to be a little bit more I had noticeable secondary feather that out a bunch and I mean you could just do an inside node it's basically the same but this is going to be a little bit more selective which is you know what we're all here for we're not going to bother tracking this because it's no big deal just bring up the gamma some lifts just a little bit to contrast it out bring up the gain and let's turn this guy off so we can see what we're doing nice so without it with it just sort of really you know brightening it up very cool so I'm liking how that's looking and just to sort of finish this off let's go to a sort of main stylize grade and just go back and look at this to make sure it's exactly what we want it seems nice and blurry and bloomie I think I do like that but you see the sharp parts get like a little bit of that extra sharpening that cool grain that happens when you sharpen and resolve that you either love or hate it oh great 32-bit glow look at that those are just computer monitors back there but you know they look like this great like fire or something looks very cool there's a look that you know I'm sure I'll use in the future as I do do some church video type stuff occasionally so you know I hope that that you can use it because it's a pretty cool little thing and you know it uses a couple nodes here which is always fun you know makes you like you know what you're doing so if you found

going to show you how to restore your headlights permanently so your hazy, oxidized headlights go from this... to this all for around $10 a headlight you might have seen other methods that get your headlights clear like kits you buy in the store such as the 3M kit you also might have seen some home remedies such as using baking soda, toothpaste, vinegar, bug spray all of these methods are only temporary and the lenses will just become hazy and oxidized over time this method I am about to show you is the only permanent method that doesn't require any maintenance such as adding wax or adding a sealer every so often not only do hazy, oxidized headlights look bad they also decrease the value of your car so not only will you make your car look better, but you are going to help increase the value of the car by fixing your headlights Here is everything you are going to need to do the job we have scissors, a garbage bag, and tape this if for taping off your headlight if you are going to keep your headlight on your car or truck then you are going to need to tape it off and use garbage bags to protect the paint now if you are going to remove the headlight form the vehicle, then you might just need some tape we have paper towels we have sandpaper we have three types of sandpaper 400 grit 600 grit and 2000 grit If your headlights are really yellow, oxidized, and hazy, then you will need to start with 400 grit but if they are not that bad, you can start with 600 grit and we are going to be doing a wet sand so you are going to have to use a spray bottle or some type of water source like a hose and when you finish wet sanding you are going to clean the lens off with alcohol before you go to the final step which is using a clear coat in this case we are using a gloss clear and it is made for plastic and the big thing is you want it to be non yellowing and UV resistant the reason your headlights are all foggy, yellowing, and oxidized is because the clear coat on the headlights gets chipped off over time from rocks hitting it and just the wear-and-tare of driving and this clear coat will put a nice barrier so the plastic cant get yellow and hazy again most people have scissors, a garbage bag, and paper towels but if you are going to buy the other stuff it will cost you around $20 so to make your headlights permanently clear $10 a headlight, that is not bad especially since some headlights can cost over $100 each! I have seen headlights that are over $250 each! so let me show you the whole process it's quick it's easy and you get awesome results that last the lifetime of your headlight so the first step I would take is, if you headlights are easily removable I would remove them it is a lot easier to do this off the car unfortunately for the PT Cruiser it is a pain to get the headlights off so I will paint them on the car and just to show you the results you should expect I was testing out different methods different sanding grits different clear coats and what I am about to show you is how I got my best results and you can see how clear those are and this is permanently clear this method will work on any headlight and get it nice and clear and you already saw the results so let me show you how to get those results these headlights are pretty bad so I will start with 400 grit sandpaper if your headlights are not this bad you can start with 600 grit sandpaper 400 is a little more gritty 600 is more fine and we will finish it off with a little bit of 2000 grit which is super fine Because we are keeping the headlights on the vehicle now is a good time to get your tape out and we are going to tape around the whole headlight and leave a nice barrier so we don't scratch the paint Im using extra wide painters tape it will help later on when we put the garbage bad around this because we have to cover the paint on the vehicle so now we have the whole edge covered there is no car paint exposed anywhere in here Now I have my 400 grit sandpaper and I have water, and I am just going to spray the headlight with water Im going to get my sandpaper and I will spray it with water make sure both surfaces are soaked the water acts as a lubricant and prevents deep scratches into the lens surface, you just want lite scratches to buff out any oxidation you have and you want to keep the surface wet and I am not pressing hard just go in a circular motion now as you do this with the 400 grit you will notice a milky color running down that's all that oxidized, yellowing plastic that's coming off your headlight and that's good you don't want to go crazy with the 400 grit you don't want to press really hard you can press harder with the 600 grit since 400 grit is pretty coarse on a headlight like this you also want to get into the groove right here and then our final sand with the 400 grit is going to be a horizontal sand not a swirl anymore so you can see our scratches are horizontal they're not swirled anymore that is the last step that we did the reason why you want horizontal scratches is so that when you spray your clear coat it is less likely to run and has an edge to grab onto I don't see anymore of that yellow, oxidization or haze I just see the haze that was created from the sanding so now we can move to the 600 grit again get your headlight soaking wet get your sandpaper soaking wet and start with the 600 grit with the 600 grit you can press a little harder you can see the finer plastic particles coming off the headlight that is exactly what you want to see now that we did a bunch of the swirling motion with the 600 grit we are going to switch to the horizontal sanding and with the final horizontal sanding with the 600 grit we have that top layer of the oxidized headlight completely removed and the headlight lens is getting really smooth so now that we have finished with our 600 grit we will move up to the 2000 grit but before we move up to the 2000 grit we need to clean these off just going to use some water and wipe it down with a paper towel the reason why we do that is because the 2000 grit is very fine and any plastic particulate that is still on here is going to clog up the sandpaper and you won't get a good final sand and this final sand is going to help you get a really good finish on your clear coat so just spray it down and get a paper towel and wipe it down now we are going to get 2000 grit its going to be a wet sand as well you don't want to press really hard on this you just want to skim the surface you are just going to cut down some of the edge that the 600 grit put on here and after you do enough of the swirling motion you can do the horizontal motion and this will be the final touch Good, you can see even with the 2000 grit this looks a lot better it's still going to be hazy, don't worry you want it to be hazy there's still going to be micro scratches on the surface here the clear coat will fit that in now you are going to dry it with a paper towel and after it drys you will see a nice haze on here so now we will grab our alcohol and we will put it on a low lint paper towel so the lint doesn't get on the cleaned lens and we will clean the headlight lens off the alcohol removes any oils from your hands that may have gotten onto the lens and it also makes the lens dry quickly because alcohol evaporates quickly so as the alcohol drys cut your garbage bag open take the garbage bag cover the front of the car The whole point of doing this is because when you spray the clear coat you don't want the paint to over-spray onto your hood or any of your paint or plastic that you have with the garbage bag all laid out we will get our tape and tape up the garbage bag so it is nice and tight So the bag is all taped down, now we're gonna cut out the headlight. You see the headlights right here? Lift the plastic, get a hole on it. And just cut around the edge of the headlight. Good. Now you can see we have this tape around here which gives us a good gap, so you don't have to cut exactly on the headlight. In fact, you don't wanna cut exactly on the head light. You wanna cut it over, you have some room to put some more tape. Like that! And will stick down. So now, we're gonna tape the rest of the headlight off, and we can begin our spray. We're gonna do one more warp down with the alcohol, just to make sure that there's no dirt, there's no oils form your fingers on here. None of that. And we'll let that dry. With the headlight nice and dry, we're gonna start our clear coat application. Make sure you follow the instructions on your clear coat. So we're gonna give you guys the side views so you could see how I clear coat the headlight. This is the final step, so make sure you don't mess it up here. You don't want thick coats, thick coats are gonna run. Make sure you do light coats, even sprays, don't worry about it if it doesn't look good. We'll do multiple layers. It'll clear itself right up. And it'll make itself look good, Trust me. That's all you wanna do. Now, we're gonna let it sit for five minutes. And then we'll add another coat. This is after our first coat. And I just wanna give you an idea of what it's gonna look like. It's not gonna look perfect. You could see there's little, let's called orange peel. It's just form spray paint going there. We're gonna get more layer on it. It's gonna look a lot better. But don't put this thick, cause it's gonna run, and won't look good. But eventually it's gonna look really clear and really nice. After about five minutes later, we're ready for our second coat. Good. We'll let that sit for another five minutes, and we'll do one more coat. Make sure when you're spraying, you're also getting the top edge of the light, and corners of the light, depending how your light is shaped. You wanna make sure that you touch all the spots on the light. Just a few minutes later, we're gonna put on our final coat on. Perfect, that's it with the spray paint. So now, we're gonna wait a whole day, the paint drys in 24 hours to full clarity. And then we'll see what it looks like. Fast forward to the next day, and this looks awesome. We can take off our over spray garbage bag cover. This is headlight looks amazing, you could see the optical clarity look great. Look almost new. Now only does it look good, but it's gonna protect the headlights as well with the UV clear coat. It's gonna bounce out all the harmful UV rays out, and will prevent any future yellowing or hazing or oxidation. This is permanently gonna stay like this. Now, at this stage, we have two options. You can leave as is, or you can do a wet sand. And the wet sand is just gonna take away any orange peel, which is typical spray paint. Just get your 2,000 or 3,000 grade sand paper, and you're gonna wet sand it, just like we did before. Make sure you have a lot of water, you wet sand it. And your final step, whether you wet sand it as 3,000 grade, or just leave it as is, you wanna add some Carnuba car wax. Just get your microfiber towel. Add wax, just like you're waxing your paint job. Cause now this is clear coated. And once that wax start to haze up, you can buff it right out. And that's the finish, it looks amazing. Now let's take the blue tape off. And that's how you make your headlights permanently clear. This came out amazing, it'll come out just as good for you. And only cost $10 a headlight. You don't ever have to take the headlight off the car if you don't want to. Hopefully this video is helpful. If it was, remember to give it a thumbs up.

and boy were they loving it as we looked on growth was beyond phenomenal as new notes continue to pop off even better yet future bud sites finally made their arrival meaning that we were doing something right but the ladies tucked away and growing in their tent there were a few more things we could do in order to give them the most help possible considering the environment first thing was first though we wanted to make sure our plants stayed low and spread out ensuring that the light could cover every square inch of those beautiful families aka the plants solar panels that said this week was all about topping and our girls were about to get a haircut so let's get into it [Music] [Music] alright guys so things are starting to get exciting at this point our ladies are starting to take some serious strides and there seems to be no stopping them what the girls finally being allowed to eat like they want it was immediately clear that this is what they've been waiting for just like that leaf after leaf started to grow with nodes shooting out intensely even better yet we were starting to see future bud sights arise showing us exactly where those long awaited flowers would one day be waiting for us unfortunately it wasn't long before we hit yet another snag now you may remember that in the beginning we made a mistake or two and that seems to be far from over remember we're beginners and we're not afraid of mistakes in fact that's the only way that anyone learns when first starting out that said it was time for yet another lesson and this one was in being able to read our plants on an individual basis sure we had a general nutrient schedule going but the best thing you can do for your girls is actually spend time to learn what you're giving them and why too bad for us we are about to learn this the hard way with a few of our smaller ladies after upping our newts it looked like a few of our girls should have been kept back on a lighter dose within a day or so we realized some discoloring on their leaves of course this yellow pigment shows up a lot better under the purple lights we have but it was still quite noticeable under regular lights as well regardless we knew we needed to take action and took the struggling plants to the bath tub to flush them now for those that don't know flushing can be done for a few reasons it can be done at the end of a grow cycle or to correct the nutrient lock out for us though we were flushing our pots because we thought we went in too strong with our newts sadly we'd lay to find out that this actually wasn't the case and that we were only making things worse with a flush but you'll have to tune in next week to see what really happened and just how bad things were about to get either way when flushing your plants you want to use water that has been dechlorinated and pH balanced and maybe depending on your situation half of the regular dose of nutrients just like that the girls were put back and it was time to ensure the rest had the best chance that they could in our tent for that it was time to do a little talking [Music] as we later learned this was a little more intimidating than it should have been of course you're actually chopping off a piece of your little girls that you're hoping to grow big and beautiful so it's perfectly understandable to be nervous however topping is rather simple as many of you already know cannabis plants have a natural tendency to grow main Cola straight up the middle of the plant that said the goal with topping is to avert this natural grow pattern in fact what we're trying to create here is several main colas all around the plant that stay low and spread out ensuring they receive equal light and nutrients in the end what people who top their plants are hoping for is a bigger and more consistent yield that said the process is easy in general people tend to top at the fifth or sixth node simply put a node as a growth of leaves if you look at your plant you will see that the leaves grow straight across from one another when two new leaves grow further up the stem that shoot off 90 degrees in the other direction as the leaves below them this is called a node one thing I just want to add here is that future bud sites grow right in the crotch of each node and you are not going to want to damage these when carrying out this process although some people use their fingernails to top their plants we decided to go with a pair of sharp pointed scissors to ensure accuracy [Music] [Music] just like that the girls were locked in the juices immediately started flowing although our ladies had begun to smell up our tent a little bit this was the first major time we could get a good whiff of that terpenes contained within these ladies and it only made us that much more excited about what we were doing of course there's a long road ahead of us but tune in next week as we try to help our girls out a little bit more with some LST or low stress training once again we're trying to keep these girls spread out so that light can penetrate to all parts of the plant and this is a pretty big step [Music] feel free to follow us on Instagram or Twitter and we just started a Facebook page and snapchat account for those who would prefer those branches of social media as well in the meantime keep growing keep learning catch you later guys [Music]", "KlPoau82SX8": "[Music] [Music] did you try to make it hot over there what's to keep me out in the dark these are the things I try hard to forget I'm still reminded by the scars left in time what you do to me you tell me is that you do but I know it ain't you watch the fire the feelings dead let you take my heart [Music] to be true I wish it were much more than just the haze of some I wish it were much more than just okay much more than [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you broke into something much more than just a phase I wish it were much more than just the much more than just

tremendous honor and a great pleasure that we celebrate the momentous occasion of jen linko's accomplishments and i hope that our great institutions can continue to work together in the future as well thank you very much thank you dean fritzen now every two years we come together to celebrate the work of a leading voice of chinese literature and poetry but we also use this occasion to celebrate young english poets who have embarked on a journey to learn how to compose classical chinese poetry or juey chu golushiro guti srijinti in english while translation is the lifeblood of tren of chinese literature abroad today historically classical chinese literary culture moved across languages and borders by way of local poets adapting their dialects and languages to follow all of the complex rules and regulations of classical chinese poetry classical chinese poetry was an important skill for anyone hoping to advance in east asia as it demonstrated one's deep understanding of the cosmos and the unique challenges humans face as we attempt to balance and harmonize ourselves and our relations it is in the spirit of this ancient tradition that the newman prize for english jeju was created and i'm excited to share a bit more about this year's winners and the poems that they have written three students from oklahoma and one british student have won the 2021 newman prize for english jhu the oklahoma winners include homeschooled middle school student tobin bossie ou student jacob dayan mustang high school student dylan che chai siri and this year's uk winner sophia cerrone from st paul's girls school in london each winner will receive 500 check and a commemorative certificate honorable mentions include jenny long of norman high wiley ziegler of whittier middle school and allison ramsey of ou and an honorable mention for teacher submissions goes to jin lingxin from the uk beginning in 2013 the newman prize for english jeju has been awarded to the best classical chinese poem written in english the catch is that they must follow all the rules of classical chinese poetry the jeju is a traditional quatrain or a poem of four lines with either five or seven characters or monosyllabic words that typically follow a strict list of composition rules the winner in oklahoma's high school category dylan from mustang oklahoma a student of karen bolin won with an amazing goo t-shirt or old style jeju scarce clouds a sky worms with wind clown stream bright blue oak birch blood fade voice still dark one last cast sun fall moon rise sweet day dylan's poem captures an eternal moment familiar to many in oklahoma the last cast of a fishing line at dusk before calling in a night the old style dreju rules require a poet to write the first two lines to introduce and deepen a description of the natural world he has that wonderful phrase oak birch blend while the third line introduces a human element and the fourth line reveals how that external scene resonates with one's internal feelings and for master poets like dylan we also receive an insight in this case that sweet days like all things exist in cycles the remaining winners of this year's newman prize for english trade you follow the new style or regulated first rules the titishir or kulushu tradition these poems must follow all of the old style rules as well as a set of additional ones that require one to create parallel meaning between word groups and couplets so that if we see cool stream in one line directly below it we'll see cold breeze they're parallel in the sense that they both are flowing and refreshing typically this effect is created by keeping word units in parallel parts of speech adjective now an adjective noun for instance but a poet may create an antithetical parallel like warm sand perhaps to create a sense of variation and contrast yet in addition to following this rule poets must also follow intricate vowel patterns that oscillate between what classical chinese poets called ping and survivals now i have to take a minute to explain a few things about classical chinese and english so that we can all come to better appreciate the incredible work these young and sometimes not so young poets have accomplished in middle chinese spoken in the tang dynasty many chinese words ended in an unvoiced consonant that means the the the larynx doesn't vibrate so p t and k these words were called za because these word endings shorten the duration of the vowel when compared to ping words which end in voiced consonants like in m or in g or no consonant at all well it turns out modern english monosyllables follow the same pronunciation rules as classical chinese but our words can end in a variety of other unvoiced consonants like s ch or f or the unvoiced th like with while all other words in english are pink so an example would be the pink word sky so the long i sound becomes its a word if we add a p to it skype shortens the sound of the vowel the p word log versus the word lock and so on once a chinese or english poet can discern the difference between ping and sub categories one can bring monosyllabic english words into perfect balance by alternating them between pink and so sounds both horizontally in the lines as well as vertically between them for more information about the english strategy form the new the new style in particular you can visit the website all right let's listen to these new style poems with the uk winner sophia cerrone st paul's girl school london her poem is a zilla start new style ghg sophia is already age 15 from singapore's small check things [Music] young child shifts new first bright storm once more spreading sophia's poem follows this ancient start vowel pattern we can see that the first lines word units were parallel in meaning with the second line as pairs like words like cold mist and thin haze right or fresh buds and sweet scents or even small chicks sing with wind chimes ring all have that unmistakable sympathetic resonance the meanings may be perfectly parallel but their vowels are perfectly antithetical they are opposite there's a unit ending in a sound followed by one ending in a ping sound below and following in the line in this way sophia's poem reveals the possibility to bring language itself into harmony and balance the yin and yang of both the meaning and the sound of words meanwhile the poem's message develops from nature to human emotion and the message of new beginnings our oklahoma middle school winner tobin bossie of norman has his own sustained new style jg hi my name is tobin bossie i am from norman oklahoma and my poem is a start new style trade you first light soft mist warm air small road flows light fog swift dust quick stream goes rough hail bitter dirt cold hard night fresh hope brave dawn young grass grows so tobin's poem begins with the two word unit soft mist which is parallel in meaning with the two two-word unit beneath it light fog yet their vowels are opposite with the first two ending and the one beneath the pink and yet as we look at the third line which we see rough hail we see an opposite meaning an antithetical one to the words just above it but their sounds are now perfectly parallel with the group above as we read the rest of tobin's poem we can see that every other word unit they're all equally well balanced with one another following that prescribed pattern of meanings and vowel sounds which result in a poem that not only announces the end of hard times and herald's rebirth but has done so by bringing language itself into harmony and balance with nature finally oklahoma's adult category winner jacob dan will read his pink start new style trajee neiman hall wall thing lee way hello everyone my name is jacob theon and i'm currently a junior here at the university of oklahoma i am from westfield new jersey and i am an asian studies major at the university i wrote this poem based upon a memory i had during a camping trip with my parents and my younger sister in mountain park oklahoma my poem is a king start new style to age you and the title of it is called the last day of summer here it goes clear sky fresh grass cool breeze slows bright dusk earth trail calm creek close blur thoughts dead and torn heart sinks fast air new trek still bird crows thank you for listening jacob's poem follows that ping start pattern with clear sky being ping unit followed by the zil unit fresh grass well the next line is a perfect opposite with blurred thoughts ending in the vowel earth trail ending in a pinga vowel and so on yet jacob has also created a wonderful sense of parallelism in the meaning of these lines where clear skies parallel with bright dusk and also creates an antithetical resonance with that third line's blurred thoughts finally his overall poem follows the underlying requirements of any trade you of this style to offer a poem that reveals the interconnected nature of human feeling in the natural world ending in a single reimagined natural image still bird crows for further reflection on this year's honorable mention poems please visit the english uh the english dreju prize website and again congratulations to this year's winners congratulations again to this year's stranger competition winners as we move more close to this evening's main event i'm genuinely excited to invite harold newman to give a few remarks harold and ruth's contributions to bringing chinese and american cultures and people closer together go back decades as a former president of asia society among other organizations and for those who have been here in person for earlier prizes you already know what a great speaker harold is and i wish you were all here to meet him in person this evening however we will hear his words from his amazing daughter joellen who is joining us from florida i'm harold newman's daughter and i'm here to read the speech that my father has written for the recipient this year he feels in his young age of 90 that i would be better in the delivery of his words than himself so this is his speech i would like to congratulate the recipient on the newman prize i have not had the pleasure of reading dream of ding village or meeting yan lanke author of the year selection for the newman prize as i have met previously all of the other selected authors at the time of the awards i have nothing to do in either selecting the authors or the work to be honored that privilege is provided to our international panel of chinese experts this format has been followed since the inception of the prize it has also included the recipient of the prize being brought to norman oklahoma to receive the medal and cash award in the past my wife ruth and i have always had the great honor to spend time with the author unfortunately because of cobin 19 and the circumstances we don't have the opportunity to spend the weekend in each other's company conversing laughing and getting to know one another much better i have included here some quotes from the reviews that i found to be quite impressive and impactful a must read for anyone interested in present day china communist ideals battle against capitalistic impulses and human nature in this grand layered novel yon's unflinching unflinching irreverence makes this shatter frida's tragedy essential reading written after three years of clandestine research on a real life blood selling scandal his lyricism of despair full of frenzied life gives his novel its atrocious grace these reviews i truly look forward to reading this book thank you thank you so much harold and joellen so yeah leonco was nominated for the prize three times in prior years more than any other author in the newman prize history and this year again by eric abramson of paper republic but this year was also a very competitive year with wuhu nominated by andrea bachner of cornell university suthong nominated by yunte huang of uc santa barbara xu xiaobing nominated by chen xiaoming of beijing university and longingtai nominated by eileen chow duke university and i'm happy to invite this year's winner the winning juror um eric abramson to introduce yan lianco better to all of us now so please welcome eric thank you very much jonathan to the university of oklahoma and to everyone present today it was my great pleasure to nominate yalenko for the 2020 newman prize for chinese literature and it is now my even greater pleasure to see him win uh as jonathan mentioned i'm merely the latest in a long line of jurors determined to honor yen with his prize and i am thrilled to be able to stand in their company and to know that they are standing in spirit here with me at this virtual podium uh what follows is a revised version of my nomination statement yen's place within chinese letters is uncontested despite the controversial nature of his work it seems every central second novel he's written has can't be published within china he stands shoulder to shoulder with the other great writers who emerged from the 1980s moyen wangani japingwa more than any other writer of his stature however yan lianko remains vitally invested in the ethical responsibility of the author though it has been demonstrated to him again and again that his explorations of china's historical trauma are not welcome he seems not to take the hint and persists in laying bear what he sees as the original sins of modern chinese society there's something almost naive in his insistent return to these subjects in a sense he has retained a measure of authorial innocence his stubbornness and the perpetual freshness of his sorrow over historical tragedy are worthy of our respect but there is another earlier yan the master chronicler of the central plains of holland observer of villagers who pit themselves against the elements both natural and social he views them with a love that has not clouded his vision he sees all sides of them has equal compassion for their suffering as he does for their depravity they are the source of the fictional voice he hit upon in the early 1990s which animates the stories of the years the month the months the days and casts a relief of existential dread and awe over the land an evocation so powerful that it is able to serve as the foundational myth making for an entire people in his fiction the land is the loom upon which all human endeavor and emotion is woven and the colors he employs are dazzling no dull tales of rural monotony here it's no exaggeration to say that yan's writing does for the chinese heartland what john steinbeck did for the american west or thomas hardy for southwest england this is the style that blossomed into yen's later more political novels a literary development exemplified by lenin's kisses and dream of ding village as his eternal rural setting is invaded and upset by the forces of change yan may be china's best historian of the ways in which chinese traditional society was unprepared for the abrupt violent incursion of commercialism and capitalism denied the opportunity for gradual adaptation and evolution lacking the institutions values and social mores necessary to protect against the destructive effects of this new way of life traditional rural society reels under the onslaught to use an analogy much on everyone's mind these days society had not had time to strengthen its immune system to build up the necessary antibodies yet under yen's pen these characters are no passive victims of these new forces no silent sufferers instead they are transformed by those forces into bizarre and monstrous new shapes and loosed to wreak havoc on their nation the 1990s led into the new century the acceleration of economic process progress paired with the absence of substantive political discourse continued to widen the split between the physical fabric of society capitalism consumerism its changing economic systems and the collective spiritual lives of the people even today the china dream continues to hang like a mirage over the realities of life in this society and in the gap between them lies all the surrealism all the truth is stranger than fiction absurdity of yen's mytho-realist style returning to yen's earliest work reminds us of how literature can knit together the whole self of a people body and soul his later novels meanwhile remind us of the extent to which china's modernity so much of its claims and its aspirations remain only a thirsty farmer's fever dream thank you very much thank you so much eric for that and so finally we will get to hear the presentation of this year's award and and we'll begin that with the introductory remarks of dean chen jianlan from renmin university

farewell", "jdg2qi_r25s": "[Music] you dreamed of the color blue dreaming of the color blue can be interpreted in a variety of ways quite often colors are simply interpreted as an indication of mood and blue of course is seen as sadness even depression we are all familiar with the expression having the blues this may be true depending on what your dream is about but interpretation of blue dreams does not end there experiencing dreams in which the color blue shows up significantly symbolizes profound peace and contentment some of the things represented by the color blue in our dreams include heaven truth wisdom loyalty devotion openness and tranquillity dreaming of blue is an indicator that you are looking towards the future with optimism and an open accepting spirit blue may also be indicative of your subconscious encouraging you to ask yourself what you have subconsciously registered about the subject of your dream when you dream of a blue that is the shade of the sky it may be representative of your conscious mind dark blue may be indicative of masculinity and should prompt the dreamer to examine the masculine side of himself or herself or take a look at relationships he or

the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this

to me they feel like a really intimate connection to the past very personal machines and back then very exclusive at least compared to the much more communal family desktops but using them today tethered to a desk is only half the experience because these machines they were meant to be mobile so what if you wanted to log into your favorite bbs or old school mmo in a 90s coffee shop from your powerbook 165 wirelessly well i have a tiny little device that can let us live some of that 90s magic today and perhaps even push it a little further and i think it can even let me fulfill a dream i talked about way back in my very first youtube video so stay tuned [Music] this diminutive device is a haze compatible modem emulator with an rs232 serial connection which can connect your modern 802.11 bgn wi-fi network and bridge that connection straight into your vintage machine basically it works with any computer with a serial port which will see this as if it were an old-school serial dial-up modem it was developed by the masterminds behind the old net.com whose mission is basically to allow old machines to access stuff over the modern internet which they've famously done through services like their wikipedia proxy browser proxy and more but this magical little device is pretty much the ultimate expression of that mission getting old machines online in a really rather functional and authentic way now there are similar devices out there but they tend to cost a bit more and especially with shipping to north america can be a little bit hard to get but this little guy this is about the most fun you can have for 30 bucks looking closer at the device we can see how the magic happens on top here is a development board at the heart of which is an esp8266 which is a low-cost and reliable wi-fi system on a chip with a full tcip stack and microcontroller that's used in a lot of iot and enthusiast projects and that's running custom firmware that imitates a haze compatible modem which was the predominant standard for dial-up modems throughout the 80s and 90s and beneath that is a custom board that funnels the connection into this rs-232 serial jack which just like the old haze modems makes this compatible with an enormous number of computers from the 70s 80s and 90s in my version 2 unit this breadboard is actually hand soldered and filed down by the old net themselves though version 3 has a very nice custom printed pcb there instead but functionality wise they're identical and these two buttons are used to reset the device marked rst and to change the baud rate back to 300 in case you forget what you set it to which is the button marked flash and we'll see why that's important when we start playing around with this but first we need to solve a bit of a problem you see this rs-232 serial jack is compatible out of the box with a ton of different computers but not old max you see macintosh's of the time used a more modern standard actually rs-422 which fortunately can be configured to work with rs232 but unfortunately it's a completely different connector now i do have this official apple adapter which goes from the mini din to your rs-232 standard serial connector but for whatever reason this does not work with the modem even when i have a gender changer on the end there and connect it it just does not read anything from this modem here and i have no idea why so i had to go to plan b and build my own adapter which i have right here fortunately i found a guide on macgui.com which included pin outs and all the wiring to build such a thing and while you can buy de-9 breakout connectors that make it very easy i decided to go the action retro route and cut up two cables an apple serial cable and just a regular serial cable here and splice them together on my holding hands here and i just twisted the cables together to test it and it does work so basically what i did was i just used my multimeter to beep out each pin on each connector to make sure which wire it went to and then followed that guide which i'll link below to connect all the right wires together so let's try this out on a mac and see if it works with our modem okay and i did test this on my 486 laptop with a regular serial port just to make sure it did in fact work and it does so now let's test this on our beautiful powerbook 1400c 166 which is maxed out with 64 megs of ram now of course this machine is perfectly capable of doing the internet all on its own without a fancy modem emulator but this beautiful active matrix screen will let us see you know what's going on so we're going to be using z term which back in the day was one of the best terminal emulators which is the predominant way that you would talk to your modem back in the day and also connect to different services so we just need to set this to 9600 baud because that's what i set the modem to on my 486 and change it to you know hardware flow control excellent x off and we'll type in a t for attention and no response let's see we'll just reset the modem and it just blinked blue let's try this again okay so still nothing before i tear these wires apart i did make sure that none of them are touching and shorting each other i'm going to hold the flash button on here until it blinks blue quickly [Music] and that means it reset the baud back to 300 oh now i'm getting something so maybe i had the baud set weird uh let's change this to 300 baud yeah you know what i think actually the problem is z term yeah so i'm using the power pc beta of z term and it is now frozen so let me grab the version of z term that i know works right which is version 1.0.1 which is actually the 68k version but i'm gonna grab that and uh yeah this is hard locked so we will restart this and be right back unfortunately this is super easy to get files onto because i put a cf card in there and you don't even need any tools to get in everything just kind of snaps apart and you can pull out cf card which i can then put into a usb adapter into my favorite bridge machine my 12 inch aluminum powerbook g4 i'll just drag over z term 1.01 okay so here we are in z term 1.0.1 and let me reset the modem and then make sure that's at 300. hey there it is i guess it wasn't fully set to 300 for some reason but now it is and it is connected to wi-fi although it's being a little strange let me try another usb power cable okay so i'm glad my first reaction wasn't to tear all the wires apart because it turns out the problem was actually a sketchy power cable into the modem which does require five volts from micro usb but now the modem works fine if you type at for attention we get okay if i type in at question mark we can see the stats of the modem and some helpful information about different commands so if we do at ampersand v we can see that we're connected to my temporary wi-fi network here action wi-fi but yeah now that we know this works i'm going to solder this cable together because that rat's nest is a little much even for me so let's do a fast forward soldering montage and then we'll try this out on a bunch of different computers and see what it can do all right well it's not the best looking cable ever but we're going for function over form here so to test it i've brought out a somewhat older machine this is a powerbook 540c from 1994 a 33 megahertz 68 lc040 powerbook with 40 megs of ram so definitely a machine that has a bit more trouble connecting to the internet and i've already got everything configured and as we'll see i have wired everything correctly so we are connected to my temporary wi-fi action retro wi-fi network and uh yeah it's live so at question mark as we saw brings up a list of all of the different options that we have so everything starts with a t which is attention which is the haze compatible command set and back in the day if you wanted to call a bbs you would type to your modem atdt and then the telephone number and it would call the bbs now that was before my time so i've never dialed into a bbs like that and there's not many vbs's today that you can actually dial into over a telephone line so what this modem emulator does is allow you to dial into an actual url and it'll pipe the content from that server through the modem emulator into your terminal so for example if i do atdt bbs dot i don't know why delete doesn't work nope atdt bbs dot fostex dot com there we go we can dial into the level 29 bbs which is the first bbs everybody tries when they get an old machine connected to the internet and this bbs is actually run by the people behind the retro battle stations subreddit and retrobattlestations.com and it's a homemade home brew bbs that actually has a lot of people logging in posting on it which is pretty cool okay so i've logged out of the fostex bbs if we go back into our help listing we can see that there's a cool feature in here called speed dial so if we do at ampersand v we can see what is in the speed dial listings so we've got the old net.coms own bbs which i think is down right now and then a couple other cool bbs's now to connect to one of the speed dials i just type in atds and then a number so we'll connect to number two and it's dialing the bbs we get our cool fancy color graphics with this nice color display and did i register here i think so yeah there we go now apparently i have mail in here and there's our nice ascii dragon for empire of the dragon so bbs's are fun but what i'm really excited about to do with this modem and actually the whole reason i bought it i like to play games online that are kind of the original mmos so way before world of warcraft and everquest mods were text-based multiplayer rpgs with many of the elements that still live in modern mmos like leveling mobs areas teaming up in groups to kill things tanking healing etc and i was first introduced to muds in middle school way back in the 90s and my friends and i were absolutely obsessed by one called asphridia now virtually all mods were run by hobbyists often using their own machine in their house as a server and they were built on freely released code bases like circle mud which was my favorite and unfortunately asphydia is long since gone being a hobbyist thing run on probably a pentium in the 90s but there are a few that exist that i still hop into and play from time to time and mudconnector.com is a great resource to find and jump on and play these games which require basically a potato could run it because as long as you can run a terminal you can connect so let's try to connect to one that i've been playing right now using our haze compatible wi-fi modem and so i'm going to do dw.kicksass.org and then colon for the port so colon 1111 that's going to dial up the death wish mud which is probably my favorite one right now because it just reminds me so much of the one that i used to play this might not be the most technically advanced one but just like the old days this is run by one person out of her house on a computer in her closet and it's been live on the internet since 1994. so let me log in with my character here yep there we go i'm in and then let me turn on local echo because otherwise i can't see what i'm typing and here we are so logged into this mud on this computer from 1994 which man that brings back so many memories i mean the first time i played a game like this it was in middle school on a no-name windows 3.1 machine that had telnet running on it so let's see who is online we actually have six people so i'm hork the dork here and then there's five other people on and they're all very high level people and yeah i still play this game quite a bit as you can see i'm actually level 44 on this character not too far from the max level of 50 and i have a couple other characters on here alts as they're called okay so a powerbook 540c from 1994 that's pretty cool but let's see if we can go a bit older this is my powerbook 165 a wonderful little machine from 1993 with a 68030 processor a whopping 4 megs of ram running system 7.1 definitely a computer that would have some trouble connecting to the modern internet mine is let down a bit by this passive matrix display which is in a bit of a need of a recap meaning every so often you have to kind of dial it in to get a good solid picture but the passive matrix displays they used were pretty sharp and pretty easy to read so i kind of like this 4-bit grayscale look okay and i've launched z term and uh fiddle with the contrast a bit and uh yeah it looks like we're connected yup 9600 baud and uh this screen i have to say for passive matrix display is pretty good so let's try to connect to our mud again and see what that looks like at dt to connect yeah totally playable on here and uh and typing on this keyboard here is quite a dream yeah you forget how good these keyboards used to be it's pretty cool playing this mod on this 1993 computer but let's exit out of this and see if we can go even older okay so i know that i always say that every computer i work on is my favorite but this this is my favorite this machine started off life in 1984 as an early production run macintosh 128k the original mac and sometime later in its life was upgraded by the apple official upgrade path to a mac plus which replaced the motherboard and the back casing to fit all the ports on the new motherboard and then i upgraded this to four megs of ram when i bought it from a guy on craigslist it was actually broken but it was just one solder joint on the analog board that i had to touch up to fix it and it's in beautiful condition i haven't done any restoration to the case although you know my reputation for case restoration but it has the original keyboard in excellent condition the original mouse still works beautifully and have it running system 608 right now booted off of my floppy emu and it can run up to seven five which i do have a drive on the emu with 7.5 on it which it's a lot of fun to run that system but system 6 on this absolutely ancient 68 000 running at 8 megahertz well this machine has never even heard of the internet let alone connecting to wi-fi and this modem emulator this is going to let me fulfill a dream that i talked about when i showed off this computer in my very first ever youtube video and that dream was to get this online and to actually play a mud on it and guess what we're gonna do right now so here is our z term and i really hope this doesn't run so slow that it's unusable my dream has come true let's enter the death wish mud and it's a little bit slow but i think perfectly reasonable so i am in the temple of asgard now so why don't we go try to find something to kill okay so a funny area in this mud is acme acres which is based off of the 90s cartoon show tiny toon adventures and a lot of these muds again run by hobbyists had a lot of very funny zones you know they didn't really take themselves that seriously and the death wish mud is no exception so right above asgard we have acme acres and we can go in here and find something nice and easy to kill now look i'm now sober i guess my barrel of beer wore off i'll do a scan to see if anybody's around here so we've got some students up north all right so k student and yeah that's um not a very strong creature let's see if there's something stronger that i can murder in here oh look here's taz let's see can we kill taz so consider taz all right i'm going to try to kill taz already knocked me down see this is the thing with muds is you have to um really watch what's going on and actually taz might kill me so let me get let me get out of there because i wasn't really paying attention yeah it's perfectly playable the screen updates a little slower than i'd like but honestly you know that was more than enough for me to see the taz was going to kill me and then i was able to flee because you really have to pay attention to everything that's happening in the text here [Applause] okay so i think there is still one slight missing piece of the puzzle here which i mentioned back in the beginning of the video old laptops were meant to be mobile so what if i wanted to go out to a coffee shop or out in the middle of a field and use the internet there and this thing is kind of tethered to the wall with this micro usb power adapter and old laptops generally don't have usb but i have an idea and in fact i've already implemented that idea because this whole time i've been running this off of my modern smartphone so i've got it plugged into the usbc port here and this is my galaxy note 10 and not only has this been powering the wi-fi modem but this has also been running the hotspot that's been connecting us to the internet so this whole time everything we've been doing we could literally do out in the field in the middle of nowhere well as long as i have a battery in here that works but yeah that's pretty cool and to make it even more portable since i wouldn't want to walk into a starbucks with all of this stuff set up just blinking away that might look a little suspicious the old net actually provides an option to get this little 3d printed case which is actually quite nice and there we go that's what it looks like inside its nice little case which is clear so you can see the lights blink blocking away inside as you do stuff and it does have pass-throughs for the buttons here as you can see the light shines through quite nicely and that looks a lot more respectable to bring into a starbucks just get a quick zip tie here and just tidy that up a bit and here we go there's our dedicated cellular modem for vintage computers and i don't know what else you'd need this stuff for you know i don't use my cell phone for anything else so there we go that is the old net serial wi-fi adapter a pretty amazing little device especially at this price point by people who have already done a ton of cool stuff for the retro computing community and this little guy can get pretty much any vintage computer connected to vintage internet services even old macs with a little bit of effort or the right adapter and paired with a cell phone and yeah the zip ties that's just a little funny but seriously paired with a cell phone and a hot spot and powered off the cell phone that's pretty amazing this whole little thing right here is all you need to get these old computers connected to the internet from literally anywhere let me know what you think about this little device in the comments below how do you get your old computers online and have you ever tried to do so before because it's a lot of fun but if you enjoyed this video i'd appreciate a thumbs up and if you'd like to see more macintosh shenanigans like this please subscribe down below and thank you very much for watching and a special thanks to spike connor justin greg from rocky mods chris and sorta eclectic and all of my patreon supporters for helping make these shenanigans possible [Music] you", "INnyFfWExmA": "[betty boop theme song] (SINGING) Boop bee doop bee\ndoop bee doop boop boop bee doop [applause] Boop boop bee doop. Boop boop a doo. Boop boop bee doop. Boop boop bee doop. Boop boop bee doop. Boop bee boop bee\ndoop boop boop bee doop. Boop Boop bee doop. Boop Boop and do. (SINGING) We want Betty. We want Betty. Betty, Betty, Betty. [applause] [betty boop theme music] ANNOUNCER: It's New York, and\nthere's a new star in town. She's just a little gal, who\npacks a big ball of a talent in a big way. Everyone needs to know, who\nis this pixie of pandemonium? That'll make an interesting\nstory for my paper. Mr. Fleischer, can you let\nme see how Betty Boop does her stuff? Yes, I'll have her ready\nfor you in just a moment. OK. And I'll have her\ngo through some stuff of her stuff for you. Fine. (SINGING) If you want to\nsee just a perfect little she, wait 'till you, get a\nview of sweet Betty! BETTY BOOP: Boop boop bee doop! [music playing] NARRATOR: They called it the\nRoaring '20s for a reason. Everything about the\nera made a big noise. ['20s music playing] Flaming youth and\nProhibition defined this time of self-expression\nand exploration. ['20s music playing] Amid this spontaneity and\nfresh approach to life, music, and the arts,\ncame a new art form that would sweep the country\nand later, the world. ['20s music playing] [theme music] NARRATOR: Animated films, or\nas we commonly refer to them today, cartoons. [theme music] No one studio was\nconsidered to be more at the forefront of this\nrevolution in this new film experience, than the New York\nCity based, Fleischer Studios. It was here the cartoon was\nbeing readied and perfected for our Darling Betty Boop. The genius and artistry of Max\nFleischer and his brother Dave, changed the animated\nfilm forever. [music playing] My father was a great\nartist, and Dave was the kind of gag man, he worked\nwith the writers, and he was a wonderful guy. NARRATOR: The Fleischer brothers\nwere raised in Brownsville, a very poor, immigrant,\nsection of New York City. But they were great believers\nin the American Dream. ['20s music playing] Even as a young man,\nMax loved cartooning. He drew his first comic strip\nfor the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1902. ['20s music playing] When Max Fleischer joined\nthe popular Science Magazine in 1906, his\npublisher immediately recognized his true potential. He encouraged my father to put\nhis various talents and skills together, to make\ncartoons more graceful. ['20s music playing] NARRATOR: Early cartoons had a\njerky, unnatural, look and feel to them. They were hard to watch\nbecause of their poor quality. ['20s music playing] It was the poor quality of\nthese films that eventually led Max, Dave, and\nbrother Joe, in 1915, to invent a new\nway of cartooning that revolutionized animation. The invention of the rotoscope\nbecame one of the key patents in animation. [island music] Footage of an actor\ngoing through a motion would be projected\nonto a drawing board, and used as a guide by the\nanimator to bring to life the characters. [island music] This gave a much smoother\nand more lifelike quality to the motion. [island music] [applause] NARRATOR: Dave Fleischer,\ndressed in a black and white clown outfit, was filmed in the\nfirst rotoscope experiments. That was the beginning of the\nout of the inkwell cartoon series, featuring\nCoco the clown. [cartoon laughter] NARRATOR: These silent cartoons\nwere shown before the feature attraction, thrilling theater\naudiences around the country with a new form\nof entertainment. Now we find gypo. [music playing] Uh? No? Hm. NARRATOR: Max's\nstudio was involved with talking motion pictures. With their very\npopular musical series \"Follow the Bouncing Ball\"\naudiences could sing along with stars like Ethel Merman. When sound films hit the\ncountry in a big way, Max and Dave were faced\nwith a new competitor. Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse. (SINGING) Yi-de-yi-de-yi. We are tough you bet-- The success of the\nseries generally relied on the ownership of\nthe popular character. NARRATOR: The\nFleischer's went to work with their own animators,\nto find such a star. B-I-M-B-O Bimbo! [theme music] NARRATOR: They created a dog\nnamed Bimbo, which was not very successful. [cartoon music] Max Fleischer then\ndecided they needed to create a character that could\nbe a real partner for Bimbo. Give him a little umph, and\nappeal, he definitely lacked. [cartoon music] [smash] [applause] NARRATOR: Betty Boop made\nher on-screen debut in 1930. The part was small, but it\ndid give her an opportunity to show off her musical talents\nin a little film called Dizzy Dishes. [MUSIC - BETTY BOOP, \"I HAVE TO\nHAVE YOU\"] (SINGING) Loving, I\nhave to have loving, but when I'm having my loving,\nI have to have Poop-oop-a-doopie now Boop-oop-a-doop! I'm so blue-- NARRATOR: Betty he was playing\nan unnamed nightclub singer who tries to win the\naffections of Bimbo. She used every frame of\nthe film to her advantage. (SINGING) And make me-- NARRATOR: She had\nthe talent, and she had that certain intangible\nquality all stars have. (SINGING) Whoopie! And if I want to make Whoopie-- NARRATOR: What she didn't\nhave were the looks. She just didn't\nlook like a star. (SINGING)\nBoop-oop-a-doop Whoopie! [applause] BETTY BOOP: (SINGING) I\nwant to make whoopie-- RICHARD FLEISCHER: The\nbody was somewhat human, but the face was definitely\nrather ugly, dog face. BETTY BOOP: Boop-boop\nba-doop ba-doop. Loving-- NARRATOR: While the\nFleischer's were trying to develop their new\ncharacter, they also knew she would need a voice\nthat would appeal to audiences. BETTY BOOP: (SINGING) I have\nto have poop-oop-a-doopie now Boop-oop-a-doop! Hello Betty, maybe you could\ngiving out a little imitation from me, no? NARRATOR: They held a\ncontest to find local talent. (SINGING) I got the\npark and the bench and the bench and\nthe park and home! I love-- NARRATOR: The finalists included\nKate Wright, Little Ann Little, and Mae Questel. Mr Fleischer, as the\noriginator of Betty Boop, what is your reason for selecting\nthese girls to furnish the voice for your\nBetty Boop cartoon? Because they were all born\nwith a certain something in their voices. NARRATOR: But it was a teenager\nMae Questel's spontaneous wit and talent, that convinced the\nFleischer's that hers would be Betty's signature sound. MAE QUESTEL (AS BETTY BOOP):\nYou can say our voice are awful, or our songs are too\nrisque, but don't take our boop-boop-bee-doop\nBoopie-doopie-doopie doop boop-boop-bee-doop ee! [giggles] Now do you get the idea? (SINGING) Do en do do\nen do do duh dee dee wanna be a man but-- NARRATOR: Over the\nnext two years, a remarkable, and\nvery pleasant change took place with Betty's\nlook and character. [betty boop music] The long dog ear, became\nfeminine hoop earrings. The animal snout is replaced\nwith a tiny nose, and the body. The body is more than\nhuman, it's all Betty. BETTY BOOP: (SINGING) Just wait\na minute it's coming your way. CARTOON CROWD: (SINGING) Here\ncomes the all right band! NARRATOR: It's 1932 and Betty\ngets top billing in the film Any Rags. (SINGING) Here comes\nthe all right band! NARRATOR: To the audiences\nwatching and listening, there isn't any doubt,\nthey have found a star. They have found\ntheir sweet Betty. [betty boop theme music] (SINGING) There's our little\nqueen, on the animated screen. Wait till you get a\nview of sweet Betty. BETTY BOOP: Boop-boop-a-doop. [betty boop theme music] (SINGING) Made of pen and ink,\nshe can win you with a wink. Wait 'till you get a\nview of sweet Betty. Those eyes, that pretty\nnose, and oh aside from this she's got so much of those. If you want to see, just\na perfect little she, wait till you get a\nview of sweet Betty. BETTY BOOP: Boop-boop-bee-doop! [betty boop theme music]\n(SINGING) Made of pen and ink, she can win you with a wink. BETTY BOOP: You hoo! Ain't she cute? BETTY BOOP: Boop-boop-bee-doop! Sweet Betty! [appluase] NARRATOR: Betty Starr was on\nthe rise and it was only 1932. She was the first and only,\nfemale animated screen star, who could do it all. Drama. [mumbling] Ohh, papa! Don't papa me! Yeah, man! NARRATOR: Musicals. (SINGING) You've\ngot to learn my soul. (SINGING) I've got\nto learn your soul. NARRATOR: And comedy. (SINGING) Look at\nme, oh, look at me. Uh-huh I'm an Indian. Ah-hah I'm an Indian. NARRATOR: Betty was more than an\nactress, she was a phenomenon. Taking the country by storm\nand straight into their hearts. [music playing] Oh dear oh dear\nwhat a busy day this has been. Let's see, where\ndo I go from here? (SINGING) Got a\nlanguage of my own, known in every bar in town. NARRATOR: Betty had\na flair all her own. She could be daring\nand assertive. All the while keeping\nthat coquettish innocence her public loved. [music playing] RICHARD FLEISCHER:\nShe was on her own. She was not a homebody as\nmost women were at that time. Betty was out working,\nearning a living. She was a city girl. [betty boop music] Did I hurt my foopsie woopsie? That's all right, Betty. How about a little kiss? Uh-uh. Naughty naughty. Oh, c'mon. Ooh [door slams]. [music playing] [gulp] NARRATOR: In Betty's big\nboss, after being chased around her boss's office,\nshe gets even with him. [betty crying] And she finally ends\nup calling the police. Sweetheart,\nsweetheart, come to me-- NARRATOR: In a time when\nwomen's rights were unheard of, Betty took the\nhigh moral ground, and the entire nation\ncame to her aid. [sirens] Chop it down boys! [gunshots] Haha. I wanna play, too! [gunshots] Woop! The Fleischer's world\nwas more of an adult world. An adult, with adult concerns,\nconcerns about making a living. Which was certainly very\nimportant during the Depression era. Betty was willing to throw\nher hat and her talents into the political arena, in\nthe satirical film, \"Betty Boop for President\". [MUSIC - BETTY BOOP, \"WHEN I'M\nPRESIDENT\"] BETTY BOOP:\n(SINGING) Some of you have money, while some\nare poor you know. If you send me to Washington,\nI'll just divide the dough. Oh, when I'm the\nPresident. (VOICE DEEPENS) When I'm the President,\nI'll handle all the money when I'm the President. What this country is in need\nof is a lot of hi-de-ho! Boop-be-doops and\nchocolate ice cream, CROWD: We say yes and we say no! Now we will get things for\nnothing, movies, cabarets and jazz! CROWD: We accept it. We reject it. You're an elephant,\nyou're an ass! Yeah. Ahem. NARRATOR: Bettie's\nperformances were only enhanced by the Fleischer's\nunique renderings. Which came to be known as the\nNew York style of animation. [cartoon music playing]\nHey what is this here? Well. Eh. Ironically,\nwhile Max Fleischer did invent the\nrotoscope, which enabled more lifelike animation. Max in principle, felt that\nanimation should do what cannot be done in live action. So consequently,\nFleischer films tend to have a bizarre\nand surreal imagery. Ohhh! Oh. [cartoon music playing] The anthropomorphic element. If you don't mind\nthe fancy word. Which is something\nvery popular today, which is inanimate\nobjects becoming animate. That was a big stylistic\nthing for Fleischer Studios. [flower crying] [music playing] (SINGING) Darling\nI am growing older. [brushing sounds] [slow laugh] Goodness gracious me. Give the little\ngirl a big hand. [applause] [cheering] BETTY BOOP: As Betty\nrocketed towards stardom, friends and co-stars\nrode her coattails. While Coco the Clown and Betty\nwere dear friends on screen and off, her relationship\nwith Bimbo was more than a little strange, it\nwas a lot strange. Oh! Aw. Aw. Oh. NARRATOR: Miscast from the\nbeginning, Betty's character had grown and she became\nAmerica's sweetheart. Bimbo remained a lecherous dog. A real dog. [bimbo singing] Holy smack! [romantic music] RICHARD FLEISCHER: Bimbo,\nin some of the films is obviously very much\nin love with Betty Boop. [bimbo laughs] But it's a peer\nrelationship, I presumed. NARRATOR: The Fleischer Studios\nand the Hollywood community began to wonder if Bimbo\nwas worth the trouble. [music playing] (SINGING) Want to be a member? Want to be a member? No! NARRATOR: Bimbo had problems. The studio was\nlooking to replace their crusty little hound. [music playing] Hello May, I've got a\nbone to pick with you. NARRATOR: Bimbo\nhad cause to worry. He seemed to have more\nenemies than friends. [music playing] NARRATOR: It was head\nanimator, Myron Waldman, who was given the task of trying\nto find or create a replacement for Betty's Bimbo. Bimbo was a big mutt, and\nhe spoke and he didn't go well with Betty Boop, you know? There's the way out! Ow! [audience laughs] MYRON WALDMAN: I\nwas tickled silly because I never liked him. [door swallows bimbo] [doors slamming] NARRATOR: But Uncle\nMack still believed in Betty, and Betty's talent. He knew just what\nhis star needed-- surround her with more stars. The rotoscope was often\nused to incorporate guest appearances by famous music\nand entertainment celebrities in the Betty Boop cartoons. NARRATOR: The Fleischer studios\npaired Betty and Cab Calloway in three major films together. Betty, the steamy\nsiren of animation, and Calloway the hot jazz man. [jazz music playing] He had a unique style,\nnot only of singing but of body movement. He did very strange, kind of\nodd, dance steps when he sang. And everybody knew them,\nthey are really popular. So when my father\ndecided to make pictures with Cab Calloway, he\nused the rotoscope. So underneath the\ncartoon of Cab Calloway is Cab Calloway,\nactually doing the steps. And when he saw it for the first\ntime, my father totally me, he fell off his seat laughing. (SINGING) Folks, now here's a\nstory about Minnie the Moocher, she was a red-hot\nhoochie-coocher. She was the roughest\ntoughest frail-- NARRATOR: The audiences\nwould go wild, and they'd applaud so much that\nthe theater owners would have to repeat these wonderful,\nmusical, cartoons. Hi-dee-hi-dee dee-ho\nHi-dee-hi-dee hi-dee Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee\nee-de-de-de ee-de-he-dee. ee-de-he-dee She must've ride\nwith a bloke named smokey. She loved him but he was cokey. Loved him while he was cokey. He took her down to Chinatown, NARRATOR: The singing sensations\nof the day would co-star with Fleischer's\nboop-boop-bee-doop girl. Ethel Merman, Lillian Roth, Hi-ho, everybody. NARRATOR: And Rudy Vallee were\namong those superstars who sang and danced in Betty Boop films. BETTY BOOP: Aw, thank you! NARRATOR: If starring with the\ntop musical stars of the day was good for Betty, it was even\nbetter for Paramount Pictures, who was also the distributor\nof Fleischer films. [MUSIC - \"KEEP A LITTLE SONG\nHANDY\"] (SINGING) Rah, rah! Keep a little song handy,\nwherever you go, and nothing can ever go wrong! NARRATOR: Paramount not\nonly produced films, but they had a huge\nmusic division that promoted and distributed\ntheir own music. In fact, the way these\nfilms were seen in their time, is probably most like the way\nwe look at rock videos today. I have done a few songs\nfrom me to you, all of them popular too, and here's\none thing you can do. NARRATOR: These singalongs\nwere a huge success. moviegoers flocked\nto theaters to enjoy both their favorite musical\nartist, and their newfound star Betty Boop. (SINGING) and any time and\nanywhere you can hear this lady crooning. An old banjo can go\nthat's no news to you, but an old banjo can't\nboop-boop-be-doop like Betty Boop can da-da-da-da! [betty boop music] NARRATOR: In the\n1930s, audiences enjoyed their sweet and\nsometimes naughty, Betty. (SINGING) You got to ho-di-do (SINGING) You gotta ho-di-do. (SINGING) You got to hi-di-di. (SINGING) You got to hi-di-di. NARRATOR: And when\nshe was teamed with the top musical\nstars of the day, everyone hummed along with her. Yeah, man! Hot, phew! You have to remember\nthat in the 1930s, these films were shown\nto general audiences. [betty boop music] Oh! Rush. They were never cartoons\nmade for children. They were always cartoons\nthat were meant for adults. And of course that got\nthem in trouble later on. Hm. Not bad. What can you do? Well, (SINGING) I'm\nnot so good in a crowd, but when you get me\nalone, you'd be surprised. I don't know how to talk right\nbut oh if you take me home, [kissing noises]\nyou'd be surprised! I'm know that I'm\nnot a good looker, but don't judge a\nbook by it's cover, Oh I got the face of an angel-- The cartoons we're\nalways a little bit sexy, a little tongue in cheek. (SINGING) You'd be surprised. I didn't go to a school but\nwhen I sit on your knees, you'd be surprised. Hmm. You're hired. MYRON WALDMAN: Lots\nof double entendr\u00e9s, children seeing the picture\nwouldn't get the adults would. You have to remember that\nthe people who were animating these films, were\nin their late teens through their 20's, living\nin New York at the end of the Prohibition era. These were people who were\nfilled with the sap of life, and that certainly\nshows in the films. [MUSIC - \"THE OLD MAN ON THE\nMOUNTAIN\", CAB CALLOWAY] (SINGING) When your sweetie\ntells you everything will be OK, just skeep-beep de\nbop-bop beep-bop bo-dope skeetle-at-de-op de-day! [applause] NARRATOR: As filmmakers\ndared to be daring, it was the theater\nowners who took the brunt of outraged\nchurch groups and audiences. [jazz music] It was 1933 and\nHollywood stars-- once beacons of gaiety\nand naughtiness-- were being forced to\ndim their twinkles, and put on more clothes, by\nthe film industry's new decency and morals watchdog,\nthe Hays office. RICHARD FLEISCHER: Mae West\nfell into disfavor because of the Hays office. They thought she was too sexy. And it even went so far\nas to censor Betty Boop. [betty boop crying] If you\ncan imagine such a thing. (SINGING) They always,\nalways pick on me. They never, never, let me be. I'm so very lonely, awfully\nsad, it's a long time since you've been glad. [crying] NARRATOR: The Hays office kept\nexerting more and more pressure on the Hollywood film community. Now we'll have a perfect\ncountry these improvements you will see. NARRATOR: In fact the films of\nthe 1930's were being blamed for many of the\ndays social ills. RICHARD FLEISCHER: Certain\ngroups, the far right, felt movies were\ngetting out of hand. Doesn't that sound familiar? NARRATOR: The Hays\nOffice insisted that Betty lose the style\nand the fashion that had made her so endearing. Short skirts, low tops,\nso lovable, so Betty. RICHARD FLEISCHER:\nBy the time they finished Betty was\nlooking like a schoolmarm, and the cartoon\nand the character began to lose its popularity. NARRATOR: But giving\nin and giving up was not the style of the tough\nNew York Fleischer Studios or of Betty Boop. Come on Uncle\nMax, give me a lift. NARRATOR: The strategy was to\nbring our cartoon sweetheart into the homes and\nthe hearts of America. By giving Betty her own\npopular radio program, and Sunday comic strip. [applause] To keep moving\nahead, Max decided to use the popularity of\ntheir queen of hearts, to introduce a new\ncinematic personality-- Popeye. In a film entitled Betty\nBoop and Popeye The Sailor. The improvisational\nstyle of Betty's films worked even better with Popeye. With another success\non their hands, Max had a renewed determination\nto keep Betty's star burning brightly. By 1936, Betty was fast becoming\nan international superstar, as the Fleischer's took\nher around the world. In fact, she would become\nso popular in Japan that they decided\nBetty Boop would give a special performance\nin the film, A Language All My Own. The Fleischer animators\nwere exceptionally sensitive about portraying the\nJapanese culture in a playful and yet respectful way. Bee-doop Boop-boop-bee-doop. [japanese music]\n[singing japanese] what does she know? CROWD: Boop-boop-bee-doop! [singing japanese] I checked at International\nHouse, Columbia University, then they had a few\nJapanese students. I didn't want to do anything\nobscene with the fans see. [betty singing japanese] -\nBoop-bee-doop-bee-doop-bee-doop bo-bo-be-doop. [japanese music] [betty singing japanese] NARRATOR: The studio decided\nto give Betty an opportunity to stretch as an actress. Instead of playing the\nBoop Boop Bee Doop girl, she was given well-known\ncharacter roles, such as Snow White. [music playing] NARRATOR: Betty played\nthis part brilliantly. The animators achieved a new\nlevel of artistic excellence, by retelling the classic\nSnow White fairy tale. (SINGING) I want to see my\nstep mama, step mama, step mama, step mama, I\nwanna see my step mama Her step mama the queen. [music playing] NARRATOR: While lauded by\naudiences and critics alike, true appreciation of\nthis Fleischer cartoon would take more than 60\nyears to be realized. (SINGING) I've heard\nabout your looking glass-- And what is says is sold. [music playing] (SINGING) Magic\nmirror in my hand, who is the fairest in the land? NARRATOR: The National Film\nRegistry eventually bestowed its greatest honor, by naming\nSnow White among the 25 greatest pictures ever made. Off with her head! (SINGING) She's my baby\nthere she stretched out on a long white table. She so sweet, so cold so fair. Let her go, let\nher go, oh lover. Wherever she may be, she will\nsearch this wide world over, but she'll never find\nanother sweet man like me. (SINGING) Magic\nmirror in my hand, now who's the\nfairest in the land? You're the\nfairest in the land. NARRATOR: Even with\nall her successes, Betty would only be as\ngood as her last picture. The Fleischer's had to keep\nreinventing their Darling Betty, or risk her\neventual demise. [dramatic music] The studio kept asking, how\ndo we keep Betty from getting swallowed by the competition? [jazz music] [betty laughs] [MUSIC - \"BOOP BOOP BEE DOOP\",\nBETTY BOOP] (SINGING) Made from pen and ink,\nshe can win you with a wink, ain't she cute? Boop-boop-bee-doop! Sweet Betty! NARRATOR: The moral\nwatchdogs at the Hays office were watching her every move. But Betty was working\nharder than ever to keep these critics at bay. [lion roaring] Place and the time I know. I gotta bench and-- NARRATOR: And Max Fleischer\nwas always thinking of new ways to keep his Betty on top. [jazz music] When the costly technicolor\nprocess was developed, Max decided he wanted\nto produce in color too. Since the cost was\nprohibitive, Max developed his own\ncolorization process in 1934, and added a three\ndimensional way of shooting, called 3D Cinecolor. [jazz music] He invented his own system\ncalled the setback system of cartooning, where the\nbackgrounds were shot in three dimensions. NARRATOR: Objects or\ncharacters were photographed as cutout figures on\ndifferent levels, or planes. Cartoons were then\ndrawn and positioned in front of the models, which\nwere placed on a rotating table to give the illusion\nof space and movement. A remarkable effect\nthat gave animated films a whole new style and look. Oh, goodness, gracious me! I forgot all about\nthat mess last night. Ohh but was that a swell party! [laughs] Oh boy! [jazz music] Cinecolor is a\ntwo-color process. Whatever the basic colors\nare, let's say red and blue. You have to photograph\none with a red filter, and then the same one you have\nto do again in a blue filter, and then you put\nthe two together, and you get the proper\nmixture of the colors. [betty boop music] NARRATOR: Once\nagain, Betty would be given the honor\nof introducing this new cinematic sensation,\nby starring in the Fleischer version of that fairy\ntale classic, Cinderella. Featuring the music of the\ntalented composer, Sammy Timberg. [MUSIC - \"POOR CINDERELLA\",\nBETTY BOOP] (SINGING) I'm just\na poor Cinderella. No body loves me it seems. NARRATOR: In her\nfirst color film, Betty wowed audiences as\na fashionable redhead. Betty put her unique talent\nand ability to full use. (SINGING) in dreams. NARRATOR: Rudy Vallee,\nthe heartthrob crooner, was given the honor of\nsinging the title song, in a brief cameo appearance. Paramount was certainly very\neager to promote Rudy Vallee through the Betty Boop cartoons. [trumpet announcement]\nHail, the Prince. MARK LANGER: Most\nof the animators were not really that\nkeen on Rudy Vallee. I've been told by an animator\nwho worked on the films back then, that the animators\nso resented having Rudy Vallee in the first colored Betty\nBoop film, Poor Cinderella, that they drew the Rudy Vallee\ncharacter to look as if he isn't wearing any pants. [MUSIC - \"POOR CINDERELLA\", RUDY\nVALLEE AND BETTY BOOP] (SINGING) Am I the\npoor Cinderella? I find my romance in dreams. Ba-ba-ba-bee, ba-ba-ba-bee. [betty boop laughs] NARRATOR: Once again, Betty\ntriumphed in this rags to riches story. But sadly, even though\nshe would get the prince, she would never star in\nanother color film again. It's the age old challenge,\nonce you've climbed your way to the top, you've got to\nfigure out a way to stay there. Well luckily for Betty, she had\nthe full power of the Fleischer studios behind her. [tense music] As the Hays office\nwatched every hemline, Max steered away\nfrom controversy. You go and get your dubs\non, and leave this to me! Oh dear! NARRATOR: Surrounding Betty\nwith new and lovable characters, like Grampy, the wacky inventor. Hm. Ah! Oh, no, no, no, no, hooray! I got it! BETTY BOOP: He's got it! [laughs] [music playing] NARRATOR: Head\nanimator, Waldman, was called on to create\na lovable dog for Betty. They said, no, we'll go with\nthe little mutt, who they named Pudgy. He's the only Hollywood star\nwho wasn't found in Schwab's drugstore and discovered. NARRATOR: But most\npeople thought that it was Betty who ended up\nsupporting the cute and playful antics of Pudgy. [dog barks] [knock on door] You're on next Ms. Boop. OK. [jazz music] (SINGING) Ba-la-de-ba-bu-cu. La-di-cooch and me. La-di-da. Oh! [laughter] [dog and cat growling] [laughter] [music playing] [dog and cat fighting] NARRATOR: Pudgy started\ngetting all the good adventures and story lines. [dog barks] [music playing] [drumroll] [crowd laughing] NARRATOR: Ironically,\nBetty's career had taken her from dog\nstarlet, to being upstaged by her own pooch. Betty was no longer being run\nragged by lecherous characters, or running for her life\naway from wicked queens. Forget worrying about\nher boop-boop-be-doop. There will be no more\nboop-boop-de-doop out of you! Aw, but this\nmorning the cleaning-- NARRATOR: She was now reduced\nto more domestic laments, like the house-cleaning blues. [MUSIC - \"HOUSE CLEANING BLUES\",\nBETTY BOOP] (SINGING) Do-do-do I've got\nthose house cleaning blues. There's floors to scrub,\nand windows to rub. I've got those house\ncleaning blues. So much to do, I'll\nnever get through. I'm getting tired\nof cleaning things, but I'm tied to\nmy apron strings. NARRATOR: But\naudiences no longer were titillated by their\ncutie with the big eyes. They just couldn't accept Betty\nworrying more about dishpan hands, than\npreserving her virtue. She was fast becoming Betty\nthe homebody, who cared more about her home than her body. All over again, I would\nhave to drop those things. I wish people wouldn't\nsmoke so much anyhow. And like any star, they wear\nout their welcome after awhile. Boop-boop-betty-boop. Betty, you have\nbooped you're last boop. [screams] Uh-oh, Betty is\nin trouble again. I take a hand in this thing. Come on, jump, jump quick. [soft music] NARRATOR: It was the late\n1930's, a different time and a different, more\nconservative, Betty. Who seemed to lose her\nrelevance with audiences throughout the country. Her career has spanned\nalmost a decade. The boop-boop-be-doop flapper\nstyle of the '20s, had lost its appeal to men and women looking\nfor stronger heroes who would prepare and inspire them for\nthe 1940s, and a world at war. Her last film was released\nin August of 1939. It was a cartoon\nshort entitled-- \"Yip Yip Yippee\". After the series was finished\nand the Fleischer studio stopped making\nBetty Boop cartoons, character lay dormant\nfor many, many, years. Until television started\nto get very popular, and cartoons started to\nbe shown on television. BETTY BOOP: Dear Betty,\nI'm giving a little party. Come right over, bring the gang. Grampy! Woo! NARRATOR: Some say she\nalways knew she'd be back. But who knew she'd\nbe so popular? Many have tried to explain this\nrenewed affection for Betty. First of all, to\ndo this in an age where women's rights,\nwomen's issues, are much more on the agenda. [betty boop music] Betty Boop was always\nahead of her time, and she handled issues\nthen which are still issues today, particularly in the\narea of sexual harassment. Boop-boop-be-doop. NARRATOR: In Boop-boop-be-doop,\nthe ringmaster proposition's Betty, and she\npleads to preserve her purity. Ah me beauty, at last. [laughs] Oh! Stop! Do you like your job? Uh-huh. Well, (WHISPERING) I\nthink if I were you, I'd-- [whispering] Oh! You mean! [slap] No! [music playing] MARK LANGER: I think\nalso, that Betty Boop has a kind of sexy,\ninsouciant, personality that's very appealing. Thank you [laughs] NARRATOR: After\nmore than 60 years, audiences everywhere have\nrediscovered the wit, the music and the charm of Betty Boop [music playing] NARRATOR: She was always\nan original talent, and now a new generation\nis being entertained. I think she's sexy and sassy,\nand she was before her time. And I think she\nreminds me of me. I always thought she was\nso cute because she was out of proportion. She had a funny head\nand a real great body, that I always wanted to\ngrow up to look like her. She's sexy and she's\ncute, and the stuff is great that they have. Betty's appeal is\nevident wherever you go. There are more than 1,000\nproducts being merchandised in stores throughout the world. This is my most\nprized position. BETTY BOOP: Even though there\nmay not be a moon up above. Hug, hug, hug,\nkiss, kiss, kiss-- One of the attractions\nabout the character, psychological attraction,\nwas the size of her head. And I've been thinking\nabout that, it seems to me that babies have the same kind\nof proportion, that large head and a small cute body. And I think when you see\nBetty Boop you immediately think of a baby. [applause] NARRATOR: Universities\nand film aficionados are studying the genius\nand the inventive style of the Fleischer studio, and\nthe New York style of animation. [jazz music] That gives me a great pleasure\nto know that Max Fleischer is being remembered and recognized,\nalong with his great creation, Betty Boop. NARRATOR: Betty's star appeal\nhas captured our hearts. And it stands as\na lasting tribute to all the great animators,\nmusicians, and actors, who have given us another\nchance to smile, to sing, and Boop-boop-be-doop. Boop-boop-be-doop. Boop-boop-be-doop. Boop-be-de-boop Poop-po-bee-doop. Boop-boop-be-doop. [soft music] BETTY BOOP: Well, Mr. Reporter,\ndid you get everything? Yeah, I got everything. [betty laughs] Well, so long everybody! [theme music] Boop bee doop bee\ndoop boop boop be doo. [laughs] BETTY BOOP: (SINGING)\nBoop-boop-a-doop boop-boop-a-doop It's the only\nthing I'll live for, 'till I turn old and gray. So don't take my\nboop-boop-a-doop away. RUDY VALLEE (SINGING): It would\nbe me to think that justice is always blind. I hope it won't be so this time. For the sake of all justice\ngentlemen, please be kind. Forgive this little\nmiss her crime. You can take her father's\nmoney, make her boyfriends pay and pay, but don't take her BETTY BOOP:\nBoop-boop-a-doop away! RUDY VALLEE (SINGING): You\ncan lock them all in prison, for a lifetime and a day,\nbut don't take her boop-- BETTY BOOP: A doop away!

levels maxing out at almost 26% popular for its high THC value Mersin levels an incredible blueberry flavor this strain is commonly used for pain control total body relaxation and euphoric blitz from novices to connoisseurs this strain is popular among the masses receiving a 4.7 out of 5 stars on wiki lead I personally found Blue Dream to be extremely beneficial for relaxation both body and mind it's great for either a day out or a night in I give Blue Dream 5 out of 5 stars just want me to like a snippet that's really good very good it's very like fruity but also just like a hint of thyme

[Music] [Music] [Music] you", "WtJnbwLndGo": "[Music] this is that we'd show and I'm a blaze camera guy 1991 if this is your first time watching the show welcome and you picked the most excellent episode to start with today we are reviewing a classic strain of the sativa variety Blue Dream dates back to the earliest days of medical marijuana in California and while many strands have become more popular since the induction of Blue Dream to our lungs this strain will always remain a consistent favorite amongst owners and medical users alike one reason this strain has become a weave cabinets table is due to its potent mix of relaxation and cerebro invigoration this one will have you feelings in one with the universe and it'll also make you want to play video games clean the house watch some porn and Jack Oh watch cartoons you know it basically just gets you up and moving around the house gives you that I want to be doing something kind of high and makes you feel productive inspired and mildly energized as well as a little warning what it's just reporting the effects of the weed it's not my fault that it makes me want to sing [Music] but I won't however take it away Ernest Borgnine I found another use for it it feels so good it makes me want to sing just like that night we spent in the tattoo parlor in Chicago come on baby I'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy prevention for sexy it hurts and I'm too sexy for my car too sexy by you get this yes that just happened now you're also gonna feel pretty hazy and uplifted when you blaze this [ __ ] up I mean I went to town on this mary-jane for my review I'm talking about going down for an hour and that's just what I did with this chick named Mary afterward I got hella stoned while she recuperated sadly the weed never put me in the giggle zone but it did put a nice smile on my face this stuff definitely melted away the blues of depression and for a time it did conk out some of my anxiety however Blue Dream is not an especially good strain to treat anxiety it does work wonders on depression it can also be calming to an extent and Ilyana however the [ __ ] you pronounce that name has made one of the better batches of blue dream as I've had some from other growers that had a lot more anxiety associated with a high still if you are suffering from mild to severe xiety the straw may not be your friend unless it's powered with a common indica or hybrid I mixed up with some grape up pretty awesome results I also don't know what the [ __ ] happened and why it suddenly hijacked the [ __ ] [ __ ] you snitch suck trying to steal my mother [ __ ] show anyway I will also add that the anxiety effects will only be a major factor for those who already have anxiety related issues if anxiety is not an issue for you then have no fear of this weed she is one of those strains that you have to try at least once if you do pleasant activities the high will be pretty long lasting around two and a half hours potentially even three and a half hours long when you're doing things are trying to have fun this is a great string the anxiety will only be minor and you won't get too much paranoia at all if you do nothing at all though you might go a little crazy on this one but we all go a little mad sometimes if you have depression or if you feel uninspired or just want a nice picnic Blue Dream will not disappoint if you have anxiety issues I would still say give it a whirl just have a good end akka or Hybrid on hand to offset the anxiety and you should be flying in no time dudes once again I'm gave a guy 1991 and you have been watching that weed show if you enjoyed the show please subscribe and click that little Bell thingy everyone talks about I would also be really grateful if you'd share

go peace", "C880N7UXaFo": "hey what is going on the youtube this is robert and today i'm bringing you to a live cop for hopefully well it's really plain and simple in the end because i had like high ambitions and big expectations and now i'm just going for something simple this week i was going be going for the zip up uh sweater or jumper that is releasing however its retail price is like 350 pounds so as of that i'm not going to be going for it because that's just a really high retail compared to what i was expecting and anticipating for it but instead i'm going to be going for one of the beanies that they're releasing and that's about it so yeah i'm just going to go for the black colorway in the over dyed beanie that is releasing and leaving it at that but as per normal let me know down below whether you took aw whether you took an l this week what you took that wa going for and as always good luck to those who are going for the u.s and japan drops obviously later on today is going to be the us drop in america and canada so good luck to you and if you'd like to comment down below what you're going to be going for the same place for those going for the japan drop on saturday but anyway there's only about seven minutes until drop so yeah let's get straight into this okay so there's under a minute into a drop and yeah in short i've got the hats tab i've got a new tab open it's probably not going to be useful and i've just got the all tab open mainly relying on hats tab though for this draw but yeah there are literal like seconds until drop actually occurs as i said i'm just going to be going for the beanie black colorway in the over dyed beanie leaving it at that because yeah it's just expensive for the other piece that i was really wanting so in any case the drop should hopefully load in supreme yep there it is beanie details aren't there which is helpful don't really know why they're not saving recently but hopefully it should just be a nice easy check out processing that's good sign maybe it's a good sign sometimes with supreme you never really know clearly not a good sign because it's it's not doing anything hey there we go thank you right anyway quickly new tab double check give it a refresh right one has already sold out scroll through very quickly they're already two colorways already sold out in the denim 338 that's so expensive full size run available in one colorway natural has still got everything nearly every colorway sold out crushers are still in stock size 34 and 30 so it goes up to size 36 i thought i only went up to size 34 but small medium available in this colorway for medium and large black colorway has sold out first in the denim crusher then the blue colorway white colorway still has a size available double knee sold out in white now as well still available site is a little bit laggy a little bit on the laggy side uh so the truck jackets are all sold out one cut away has sold out in that one colorway has sold out in that not the colorway i was expecting other than that all of the paint pants have sold out and one colorway in the trackpad has sold out nearly all of the crushes will buy now all of the crushes are probably gone and yeah i'll drop it refresh and then we'll just go through the tabs as per norm but yeah two minutes so two minutes in or just above two minutes in that colorway has now sold out in the piece that i liked but that's just a it's just a high retail unfortunately in the sweater but yeah going through other than that obviously the pants sold out the black colorway's gone in that none of the teas have gone all of the crushes have gone as for beanies they're still in stock which i think they'll probably sit this time around or a couple of the callaways will end up sitting but it will take a couple of minutes for any of them to go and yeah let's run through all the tabs and sections anyway okay so if you're going to be going for the leopard trench or the tracker jacket or the track jacket they're all going to drop under jackets currently all of the denim tracker jackets have sold out and other than that nothing else is gone the colorways go blue than tan in the trench then we have white black and blue in the denim and then we have black green and dusty red in the track jacket retail was 218 that's probably really fair on it to be honest if you're going to be going for the plaid flannel shirt or the blurred short sleeve shirt and they're going to drop under shirts currently the purple colorway is the only one to have sold out in the purple flannel not in the purple flannel but in the flannel and that is about it the colorways go purple black and then brown and then we have black and off-white and yeah just checking other sizing medium and large medium large available so yeah definitely like clear like sellout within like a minute on this colorway so yeah if you're going to be going for the zip up sweater or the split logo pullover or the splatter top they're going to drop under top sweaters currently only the natural colorway has sold out other than that nothing else is gone as for colorways they go natural and then black then we have white black navy and yellow then we have black red white pale yellow and green and yeah this just has medium left in stock but yeah took like a solid nearing like three minutes to go in the end so sadly if it was like half that retail it would have gone in like 20 seconds or like less like flat with no problem if you're going to go for the zip up hoodie or the crewneck or the uh s hoodie they're going to drop under sweatshirts currently none of them have sold out and the colorways go ash gray cardinal lime black light pink and then washed navy then we have orange light pink leopard black dark raw and ash gray and for the s logo piece we have black red ash grey navy light pink and that is going to cover it if you're going to be going for the painter pan or the track pant they're all going to drop underpants currently only one colorway in the trackpad has sold out and every colorway in the painter pan has sold out uh black and blue went first white had a couple of sizes left in stock and yeah the colorways go blue white and then black then we have purple yellow and black if you're going to be going for the veloshore or the s short then they're going to drop under shorts currently none of them have sold out and the colorways go dusty red black and then green then we have ash gray navy light pink red and black if you're going for the long sleeve tee it's obviously going to drop under t-shirts currently none of them have sold out and yeah the colorways just go yellow white black dark magenta green and light purple and yeah purple and yellow are the only ones to have any sizes uh go from them so far if you're going to be going for the crusher or the overdyed camp cap or the compass six panel or the over dyed beanie then they're going to drop under hats currently obviously the denim crusher has sold out other than that nothing else has gone so far and yeah that's about it as for the colorways they go black white and blue in the denim piece pink green black and blue in the camp cap then we have red purple cyan and olive and then black in the compass piece and lastly we have grey red yellow black brown blue and coral in the over dyed piece if you're going to be going for the lunchbox set it obviously is going to show up under accessories currently the lime colorway has sold out and nothing else has gone colorways go lime leopard and then black and yeah oh this colorway has now sold out as well so yeah 58 pounds and that colorway is gone just add that to basket casually but yeah i think they'll keep restocking and things but yeah now we're just going to move on to sizing of which i go through three by three and if you'd like to you can pause at any point in time and that's about that uh so yeah drop was quite casual processing times seem to be like getting longer and longer and longer for some reason i don't really know why they are they seem to be just getting longer in the end but they are that's about it you know i don't really understand why it takes so long nowadays but at the end of the day i checked out beanie that's it it's just going to like join the collection of beanies in the end and yeah as for other pieces well the site is a bit slow so maybe that adds to the reason why you know we have some difficulties processing even trying to scroll like this is very all over the place so yeah i'm sure a lot of people checked out what they wanted in the end because it seemed very simple to do so but then again if you're going for a more hyped piece maybe it's more difficult but for a beanie it's just nice and simple but obviously that's because it's still in stock currently but yeah i wish that the sweater was a low retail because i would have gone for it for the personal but i'm really not looking to drop that uh amount on it this is so bad geez uh but yeah i didn't realize that they went up to size 36 in the end i saw a lot of people say they're going to be going for 34 because that equates to like a large sort of size but i would have thought that size 30 would have been what people were going for because that's normally the move with that but yeah that is going to cover everything and that is the end of sizing so obviously we've given the new tab a refresh once more i don't know why they keep replacing and putting in the new tab and taking it away and everything doesn't really make too much sense but at the end of the day we're just going to look through and see if anything else is sold out nice and smooth as per norm but yeah currently things are obviously restocking and coming back into stock so we're probably not going to see items completely sold out except for the painter pan uh for quite a while because as you can see things are just coming back into stock like that crasher has and yeah but yeah lunch boxes are also back in stock so yeah things are just going to keep restocking at the end of the day but that is going to cover it anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed like much appreciated other than that come down below whether you took a w or whether you took and now what you took that wl going for and yeah good luck to those who are going for the u.s drop basically it's going to be between like the the trucker jacket and the pan in the end uh will be the items that will sell out the fastest to be honest maybe this colorway in the flannel but i don't see anything else taking that sort of top spot but yeah good luck thank you for watching i hope that you have a good day and i'll see you all next time peace", "QrKyWp-q_Jc": "smoke weed every day so so so so you", "GCHJ5llFB84": "folks it's Grammy here my mom's place her plants been hanging for about a week and a half she informed me that she was bending some stems and they were breaking this plant is more than dry enough so time to get it out of here get into the trim bin trim it up weigh it up and find out the final results of mom's grow well there we go mom's first time in trim Jail fortunately the plant is quite dry as you saw not too difficult what do you think mom I'm pretty happy hey that's good the trim bin is doing its job keeping the mess contained there's such a wonderful wonderful product if you are a small budget grower and do some trimming and you don't have one of those I recommend you get one it's just it's great keeps the mess contained and it's got that little tray underneath to collect all the trichome heads that fall through the screen it's pretty awesome you know what I'll leave a link down in the description to Amazon I'll put an affiliate link down there and if you want you can go click on it and check it out maybe get one for yourself yeah I think I say awesome product Oh mom's trimming away grab this before she got too carried away with it and it's at the top of the plant not sure how well that's gonna show up it's pretty nice in there especially considering the stress that it was put under from being too close to the light for a while turn dude all right hmm not bad at all mom not bad at all Oh the trimmings almost done get it onto the scale see what the final results are Mary and mom cleaning off her Fiskars the trimmings done she's got herself a nice nice bowl of buds I don't know what did you think of we trimming mom okay you only had to do one little plan so that sir probably made a difference I'm glad you like it when I harvest mine maybe I'll get you over and you can help me I'll see ya there's all the trim in the trim bin see down below it's not a massive amount that there are some some trichome heads fell through well that's cool the little brush that comes with the trim bin sweep them up and make use of those one other little bonus with it I think the best feature is that it keeps the mess contained instead of well it's one little leaf on the floor but you could imagine the mess especially if you get a little dog they can get into messes enough cameras picking that up down there forty four point eight forty four 6:45 ceiling fan messing with the scale anyways put that paper plate on tear at the scale dumped all the buds on ya we're somewhere around 45 to 46 grams not bad not bad whoa folks this is a struggle here this this cannabis is so dry a little over dry perhaps so anytime they tried to touch it or do anything it just wants to crumble it's almost as dry as buying a buying weed from the government store it's pretty crumbly fortunately mom got herself some boba packs so we're gonna introduce those into the jars and hopefully that will increase the moisture in the plant it'll improve the texture and make it easier for mom to handle her buds when it's time to time to handle them over two packs to the rescue again folks I hope you've enjoyed this little video series of growing weed with my mom I don't know we've had fun did you have fun mom yeah just wanted to show that really anybody can do it you don't need to invest a whole lot of money we were lucky because the light was donated to us but yeah whatever it was just an auto flower seed throw the seed and some dirt and water pretty simple mom's got a nice little harvest to show for it so yeah that was what we really wanted to you know let people know that it doesn't have to be difficult it can be if you want it to be but it can also be pretty easy to grow some decent cannabis for yourself as I've mentioned I grew up blue dramatic as well and I will leave a card at the end of this video if you want to check that out and see the results of my plant and compare what mom did what I did and yeah maybe you're interested in growing the strain yourself just curious of what outcome you can expect so go ahead and click on that and we'll meet back in my tent sometime soon right thanks for watching", "4ef2zeetG7Y": "hey folks it's Grammy at my mom's place checking out her blue dream addict Auto flower she's got going this would be day 16 for it under the Mars hydro TS 600 light 16 days into it things are going well see the soils a little dry mom's just getting some water ready for it we're gonna give it give it a good drink and then I'm going to take care of some IPM little integrated pest management for moms plant we'll be adding some gnat Nick's to the top of the soil after it's watered and then we'll give it a spray of overgrow bioptic foliar so I'll pause the camera we'll get back on when its watering time we're back mom's got the water go ahead you know gently water around the entire pot give it a good drink and not not to plant or too much well sorry before when you're laughing isn't it how's that perfect alright you know pause it and go grab some of that Nick's alright then that next I'm gonna do this instead of mom the mask on just cuz it can be dusty you know apply a good layer of this maybe a quarter inch to a half inch thick all right let that dust settle and we'll get mom back in here to spray it with over girl that Knicks down the dust has settled so just for Mom and anybody else who doesn't know is not Nicks is a recycled glass product and what it does is it helps prevent fungus gnats and other little pests from going from out here into the soil or from in the soil out little baby fungus gnats will spend two-thirds of their lives down in the soil and then they'll try to come out when they do this will shred them so mom have you seen any little flying pests or anything yet no I haven't seen any wonderful that's a good answer hopefully that's the answer every other time I ask you as well so that's one step in our art our IPM our integrated pest management and it's the other step over grow from optic foliar I spray that on everything that I grow including my sunflowers and it's a pretty awesome product so this not only will provide a full year feeding to the plant and give it good nutrition that way it also helps to prevent mold and it also helps to deter pests so pretty wonderful product and the bottle over to mom if you want you can it's ready to go okay just hit the trigger give it a good spray soak those leaves okay that's good we can spin the pot and give it a little there you go yeah rotate the alright that's that pause the camera for a second okay I think that's it for this time we were gonna do some training but the plant doesn't seem to need much training right now pretty pretty nice structure to the plant I'll check back in a few days let that optic foliar overgrow do its job see how the plant responds to that and it might require training in a bit aside from that we might raise the Mars hydro tea s600 another inch or two maybe just compensate for the growth of the plant keep the same distance that it was yeah well check back at mom's place again in the near future and see how it's doing then well it's been a few days five days to be exact and holy cow mom's plant is doing pretty good seem to seem to like the over girl can see the the wingspan as wide as the pot now pretty good I brought my pH meter my TDS meter over I'm gonna just check mom's water just to satisfy my curiosity I'll pause the camera get it up on a tripod and carry on then all right got some of mums just water just give it quick quick test see see what it's at so ideally we would like a pH somewhere in the range of six point two to six point eight and that would be because at that level that's when the majority of nutrients are available for the plant to uptake at that level if the pH gets out of that range then some nutrients aren't available to the plant now we've yet to feed any nutrients in the water just whatever is in overgrow we've got a pH of six point nine six yeah so a little higher than we would like but that's not really the end of the world okay below seven that's good if it was up around eight then we'd be concerned [Music] and then this TDS meter measures the total dissolved solids it's sitting at 4:15 417 which I don't think is bad anyways yeah that was mostly just to satisfy my curiosity and put me on the spot and tested me thanks mom anyways I brought over my hygrometer and thermometer as well just also to satisfy my curiosity it's around 77 Fahrenheit in here Tangled 77 Fahrenheit 26% humidity dry it's winter in Ontario that's how it goes okay pause it and get reset up here all right now see the plant has been growing so it's about to be in about 12 inches from the light so I put mom to work mom can work those ratchet straps and raise the light up hold on to that see the loose one here and you know what maybe I'll do that for you yeah hold on let's let's prevent catastrophe okay there I took care of that for Mom you got the light back to being 15 inches away now accidentally hit pause there we had a executive meeting he's an executive decision that we're not going to do any LST on this plant instead mom's just going to do some leaf tucking so all that's gonna mean is this great big fan leaf here it's kind of covering up that little branch there yeah we'll just tuck the big leaf under same on the other side all right spin that around same with that one just kinda there you go excellent no yeah it might be over to look at you go alright all right that will do for now and that will be something that you know every couple of days you'll come in and see the new smaller branches poking up and you just move those big leaves out of the way just tuck them down under okay should be good but mums blue dramatic after three weeks looking pretty good we'll be checking back in another week or so and see how it progresses hopefully start some flower development soon yeah I had one of these blue dramatics as well and I was pretty happy with how it turned out if you would like to see that and my other Auto flowers I have a whole playlist dedicated to them and I will leave a card at the end of the video right here for you so click on it and I'll see you there", "MEezCWODxs0": "hey what's up everybody Betty Crocker here this is day 14 of veg in my 4,000 watt blue dream flower room just want to give you guys another update as to what's going on in here first of all since my last video I haven't touched the plants at all I fed them really strong right all right after I made that video that was day 7 gave them a bunch of CNS 17 grow and a bunch of cal-mag actually gave them EC 1.8 I said I was gonna be like 1.6 but interviewing 1.8 and they took it just fine I did not water the fire oh geez that are in the back row though they they do not need water at that time and they're not deficient of nitrogen like the blue jeans are so they do not get water but now it's been seven days I haven't wanted anything yet actually yesterday I came in and there are like three plants that were starting to get light so I gave them just a little bit of plain water just to hold them over until today and I'm sure you can hear the water sloshing in the background that's my reservoir it is stirring up right now I'm gonna go ahead and feed the plants today just as soon as my pump which stirs my reservoir eats the water up enough right now it's about 57 degrees from the wait till I guess the 68 degrees then go ahead and water right now my pH is five point seven my EC is 1.8 and basically doing the same thing a bunch of CNS 17 grow and a bunch of Cal meg and that's it I think I did about 25 30 gallons or so worth of water and I did 450 milliliters of CNS 17 grow and then I think it took 200 milliliters of cal-mag in order to get up to that 1.8 work something something like that but anyway the plant side for the most part are greening up the ones that are directly under the light our little yellow scope from the light stress but besides that the plants are happy and green and I I know like every time I see the little girl blue dream they get the hot spots like right underneath the lights so I'm gonna try and get some super spreaders in here before flower or soon after because I know the blue dream can't him without really intense direct light but yeah the plants that aren't directly under the light are nice and green I see that one's pretty light green because it's rare Neath the lights in with that one but then back here these ones are nice and green again and I have the lights drop down on I'm pretty tight too anyway as far as lolli popping the topping I meant to do that it's gonna do it around 810 but I didn't get around to I just kinda let the plants push out and now that it's day 14 I've decided to go ahead and top everything and lollipop everything but I'm actually gonna wait a couple more days I decided I'm gonna veg for 21 days total so I'm gonna wait until probably day 17 16 or 17 and then come in here top all the plants lollipop all the plants let it veg for a few more days until day 21 and then at that point I will flip them into flower okay that's it for my veg 14 veg new 14 update guys so just to recap I haven't died anything in plants in seven days right now I'm going to feed them hard wait a few days cop lollipop and then I'll let them veg for another few days after that until day 21 then flip the lights okay I'll check back with you when I flip the lights peace", "CGIc2TBXxVE": "what's up are you dragons I'm toasty dragon and today I'm telling you guys a life story that I promised a while ago and it's about the first time I smoked the wheat strain blue dream if you don't know what blue dream is blue dream is a hybrid weed it's a 50/50 split between an indica and sativa which means it's like a cross between you know like a head hotter body huh so it's pretty good if you want more information I'll link to a review of it in the description so make sure to go check that out if you want more information so to get in the story it's about 10:00 p.m. Thursday and my dealer hits me up and he's like hey man I got some really good [ __ ] right now my wakanda's because like it's blue dream so I do some research on it and get gather information pretty much I found out that it knocks you on your ass which in my opinion is a negative for me because I don't really like going to sleep it's kind of like wasting the high so I text my dealer back and I'm like I don't have any money right now but if I have any money by the end of Friday I'll hit you up so of course wanting to know more about it from someone who smoked it I actually went to school Friday and asked potent Bob from the original story if they had actually ever smoked blue dream of course they hadn't but in second period me and boat asked around the class because that class is full of stoners and this one kids like dude if it's royal blue dream it's some good [ __ ] like you need to get it it's one of the best ways I've ever smoked so going off this kids word we actually bought some later that day at like 10 p.m. but originally boat and Bob came to my house at 5:00 p.m. so we just chilled pretty much but within that time amount we was pretty much collecting money trying to get as much money as we could and somehow we ended up with a hundred dollars now I didn't know how much one hundred would buys at this point in Tom so I text my dealer I'm like how much for a hundred he's like seven grams so I was so hyped at this point that I [ __ ] ran maybe a quarter of a mile and four fad yeah I'm not really that fat but I mean like I'm lazy [ __ ] for someone who's lazy that's a lot that's a lot to run and by the way the walk backs up so story here if you get seven grams of weed don't get too excited run a quarter mile and have to walk back because it's gonna hurt everywhere so at this point we're pretty much just waiting and I actually texted my daughter I'm like hey can you put each gram a separate bag and he was nice enough to do it so 10 p.m. hits and my dealer pulls in the driveway and hands me the weed and then we go inside get seven seven different plates and break it up on those seven different plates now at this point I actually hadn't got my bong and this is another funny story that I may save so we're breaking up this weed and we have to wait for my mom to get home now and we're like already sort of high one because we're tired and two I'm pretty sure it was so powerful that we was in there smelling it pretty sure we got half that so I don't know it may have just been a placebo effect but I know it was some powerful weed so again at this point we're waiting for my mom to get there and when my mom gets there she rolls each of us two blunts I think I smoked one of my blunts and I was already [ __ ] high off my ass so I actually didn't get the munchies because at this point I had smoked so much I just don't get the munchies anymore and this weed in general just didn't give me an appetite so I didn't eat anything actually just went downstairs and chilled and listen to music and boat Bob were upstairs of course if you smoke a weed that's gonna make you fall asleep and then lay down you're gonna [ __ ] fall asleep so I sleep like maybe 14 [ __ ] hours and then wake up at like 8:00 p.m. 7 p.m. and boat and Bob are gone apparently they went home and I didn't know but my cousin was still there because he had came over and smoked with us to boatin Bob took one gram when they left but there was still pretty much like maybe 3 grams left I smoked one gram with my cousin and it knocked me on my ass again I would say I slept until 12:00 p.m. on Sunday so it was still pretty [ __ ] late so at this point on I have school in the morning and I smoke again except I don't fall asleep this time because I know I have school I tried to drink a monster to to sober up but it didn't work and I go to school and I was pretty much ha all of Monday cause for some reason this weed lasts a long time and it has so much THC like stayed in my system for 3 days so I wasn't actually not high until the end of Wednesday so for the end of this video I actually have a little added note for you guys since you watched all this way so before this I had ordered a bong expecting to smoke the weekend and they said it was gonna come in till like 14 days and I wasn't expecting it to but over the not when we smoked the weed and my whole house smelled like weed by the way the delivery man apparently delivered my bong so you know his ass was [ __ ] like at the door and he was smelling that [ __ ] weed because we had a window open so he obviously smelled the weed and he knew he had to know it's just a funny situation cuz I mean he had his ass had to know that we were smoking weed and he's like oh well just [ __ ] leave this bong here so it was kind of funny if you guys actually want to hear a story about the first time I smoked out of my bong then tell me and I will make one but until then I'm toasty dragon if you like this video then leave a like if you want more videos like this subscribe if you do either of those I'll send you a toastie dragon toaster and your toast will be perfectly browned and buttered for the rest of your life I'm toasty dragon and I'll see you guys in the next one peace he doesn't matter you know anyone", "PgdkbMZWy6Q": "hey folks your Grammy thanks for clicking on my video just having a quick peek at my garden that's not why we're here today we're here to go check out my mom's garden she phoned me let me know that there's a little bit of trouble that Mars hydro light is more intense and we gave it credit for the top of her plant is getting a little bit caught yeah things are good in there we'll save that for another video time to get over to my mom's place we're gonna level looks great ish yeah all right the camera month thanks alright and see these leaves up top look like they've suffered a little bit probably from being a bit too close to the light slightly faded a little little crunchy on the tip there the lower leaves are still green and lush huge so anyways mom's light raised up a little more hopefully that'll prevent any more issues at the top all right Oh checking out down near the bottom let's see a few of those lower leaves I've had enough of living so my Fiskars mom time to time to go to work remember to remove the cover off those for your protection and slide that down I go all right and then just snip those close to the trunk you don't have to be right flush so we'll just get those rotted leaves out of the way they might attract pests or something so you don't need it huh what do you think well I see as well all right well here we go so it's day 52 today we're expecting the plant to go about 80 days yeah other than a little bit of light bleaching at the top from being too close to the light things seem to be going okay for moms blue dramatic a little flower uh you know what how about I show you something let me pause the camera and get out of this closet and show you what the heck mom's done now folks do you see that yeah mom went and bought a little tiny to buy to grow tent she's up aren't you mom hey Scotty reel was right cannabis is the gateway to gardening so but you know I once heard that having the ability to grow your own food is like being able to make your own money mom's sick of buying lettuce so you got try growing some how cool is that and we'll have a nice little tent to hang up a harvested cannabis plants in about 30 days a mom all right I just wanted to show you show you what's happened mom's full-on indoor gardener all right here we are now day 56 and things haven't gotten worse haven't gotten better just kind of kind of the same yeah I still think that late might be a bit too close to the top of the plant even though it's only a 100 watt light it's just a little too much to be that close but it's a little too weak to get down to those flowers down at the bottom so I brought some bamboo stakes over hopefully we can get this branch propped up a bit and yeah get those flowers a bit closer to the light for the last couple weeks of the plant's life so alright so a few things to do we're gonna raise the light again a few more inches and then get the stakes in there get those lower branches up a bit higher and yeah we'll go from there okay there we go got the light up at two stakes in any way supporting those lower branches that's good hopefully they're gonna produce great big fat flowers that would get so heavy they would need support but yeah you can see it's got those those flowers much higher and closer to the light than they used to be the top of the plant it's pretty damaged unfortunately yeah I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out keep things going see there is some some trichome development in there that's all right unfortunate that the top of the plant took on the damage so there's going to be any loss from that damage it will probably be from both there they're up where most of the the light burn and the bleaching and it occurred yeah unfortunate but not the end of the world because there's still all those other buds and flowers growing down here mum sent me a text she was a little concerned it's one big old fan leaf down here colour starting to fade and you can see something going on there she was just not sure what I think is happening is just the plant is going through the flower stage and hasn't been given any nutrients so it's probably starving probably cannibalizing itself a bit sooner than we want it to really so I asked mom if she had any plant food she's got this stuff here we're gonna just watered the plant yesterday it's gonna be a couple days before she needs to water it again but she's going to add some of that plant food to it and hopefully that will slow down this early fading that seems to be happening again it's just the largest and lowest fan leaves so I think it's just the plant using all that can out of them and then once that plant has been used or once that leaf has been used up and it can be removed and those leaves down here they can get the light and they can be used up so yeah may be time for a little bit of select defoliation yeah especially now that I got those other branches tied up it's getting a bit more crowded in there alright well yeah I'll get some scissors trim away those leaves get back at it alright there we go got rid of some of those large decaying leaves a bit more space a bit more airflow in there yeah there is uh get mum to feed the plant a couple days from now and then we'll check back in a few days after that see how the plant has reacted and see if we need to put in any more stakes to support these other lower branches but I think leave it there for now so", "etQQNADmSnQ": "all right so welcome everyone to week 11. uh remember all the lectures that i make are recorded and so you can always just follow them step by step i made this now i didn't i definitely did not make this uh it's just something you can buy and then you'll know it's a free it's a free demo um yeah there's uh there's always youtube demos but everything you need to do for my assignments are always in the lectures that i give um and always just um feel free to screenshot what you're working on and send it to me i'll take a look at it like when i looked at the blueprints earlier it's like yeah the variables aren't being set right you know so it's always something like that and if you don't do it right then nothing works and it's it's very frustrating so unreal engine is great when it works right when it doesn't work right you're just gonna like what's happening you know what's happening so yeah when i uh when i was in grad school um my master's thesis that i wanted to do was actually on clouds like doing realistic clouds and having light bounce inside of the clouds accurately and render them quickly and stuff like that and i kind of have this dream or a vision of making a game in which uh there's not it's not it's just like um it's very peaceful you know you just kind of like walk around and you know maybe there's game stuff to do but it's not like smell that smelly bathroom smell the smelly bathroom you want to go inside no yes that's locked you're not allowed to go inside how dare they you're supposed to go inside the restroom that's why that's the whole point of the thing chronovirus girl you can't go inside so yeah like i wanted to make just like i don't know uh meadows like forest meadows and like islands and stuff like that and have game stuff to do but like mostly just have it be a place where you just like enjoyed being there you know whereas in most games you're walking around and the environment is oftentimes very uninteresting or is just in the way or you need to traverse it to get somewhere um bellheim actually does a pretty good job with that valheim has dynamically generated islands and mountains and stuff like that and they're just beautiful and even though you know they're random and there's no real intelligence or sense to them at all it's still quite possible to appreciate a big valley and approach it from an engineering standpoint how do i build a bridge across this and stuff like that we're lucky we got a good island we got a good island yeah it's true build up a harbor and stuff like that um yeah the dream was like in the movie explorers i haven't seen explorers the meditation game not yeah not meditation exactly like have have game stuff to do but really just where's all the people in this have the point of it being just that mood you know kind of like how the mood of uh goes to tsushima it's very beautiful but the mood is always very somber you know and there's always like this feeling of the world that's coming to an end because the mongols have invaded tsushima and the way of life as you know it is ending and your uncle is you know maybe not going to be too happy with you with what you're doing yeah i have a question you find dead horses and things like that i have a question why in the world do they have bottles out and no people out to occupy them yeah probably because doing people would be hard more time consuming yeah but they've got you know sodas for sale you got their uh look at that that's pretty it's pretty detailed that's it's honestly like quite a bit of detail on this thing um let's zoom up lakes over there to the fountain we go under the water actually go under the water they have a post processing filter you guys see that so that's like a film grain effect chromatic aberration and what else is going on there blue tinting when we come up it fades out it's got fades i feel like the fading should be always it's like out of focus too right here to hide the fact that yeah that so oblivion and skyrim have this problem to you where if you set your camera right at the level of the water you can actually see underneath it with perfect clarity and you and doesn't it but it still counts you guys being underwater but you can find all the barnacles and stuff like that yeah that's it's always a problem in video games right at the point of contact so yeah is that a person right there is that like the one only person oh hey yeah never mind is there a car no this is like a never-ending world uh you can see the banding do you guys see the bands on the uh the fencing back there that is an anti-aliasing effect so when you have their banding right there banding right there yeah yeah and the stairs in the back there and so what happens is when you're drawing a line when you're rasterizing a line um sometimes the line will be on one pixel sometimes it'll be on the other and if you have a bunch of lines like on the stairs at a far distance you'll end up getting what are called moir patterns and see as i move towards it you can see the thing will flicker and flicker and flicker and it looks pretty bad right and then even even as i get closer this way you can see they're still kind of shimmering bail out of that hello see how they're still kind of shimmering as you walk towards it it doesn't it does not look good and so there's things called temporal anti-aliasing where it will blend between one frame and the next so the um those shimmering effects you see that on the second bench back there you see how there's like flickering back there if they had a tsa turned on it wouldn't be it wouldn't be flickering like that it would average out between the different frames um and then the moire patterns can usually be solved by having anti-aliasing turned on there's actually a really big level and so some people put a lot of time into making this this demo here um like if i go up you can see that's our gargantuan park that's absolutely mammoth in size turn off anti this thing no i mean you want it you want it on to deal with all the flickering effects and stuff like that oh you turn it off yeah i mean if you don't carry you don't care it's a frame rate thing i guess like those fences just don't look good you see it you see all that over there do you guys see the flickering on the the more patterns so yeah there's lakes there's trees there's sunlight i did i did turn the sunlight down because it was kind of oppressively bright when you first launch it it's like blinding there's the hot dog stand down there how many frames a second am i getting it's like 11 or something like that so that's not screen space reflections you see that when i move the camera down those objects are hidden but it's still reflecting there it's still reflecting them so that's good screen space reflections if i if i move the camera down like that the reflections would vanish off the lake and it's a really crappy looking effect you can see the water material they got here is pretty nice they got a couple different they got a panning uh normal map and i think they got two like you can see one's moving this way and then one's moving the opposite direction on it it's kind of an interesting interesting take on it we got lots of trees of different kinds benches my guess is these sidewalks are made using splines a spline is a curve it's like you might have seen that with like the waterfalls and stuff like that how you can drag and you have control surfaces where you can bend them and things like that so they're probably using splines to do all the streets and sidewalks and stuff like that but uh man this yeah this is exactly the kind of thing that i wanted to do like when i was in grad school just having just these really beautiful peaceful you know environments the trouble is there's nothing to do in it right so after you've kind of walked around and looked at everything it's like quit right so yeah there's that you want it to be a game that it's got stuff to do let's take a look at this this is the landscape selecting landscape area park square is this landscape interesting it's playground there's just a lot of detail on this and so um why am i showing this to you i don't know inspiration uh mainly because my topic for today is lighting and i wanted to show you guys still got my voice back from sea shanty night which is kind of disturbing it's been almost two weeks now so you can see the shadows here you can see there's the sun the sun's got bloom on it it's bigger and smaller it's got some flickering which doesn't look very good the tia there's this kind of white haze in the air which is kind of an interesting take i actually had to turn it down the sun the sun was actually too strong direction that sort of stretching light so originally it was at 10 lux and this is this is what it looked like naturally in the demo you can see it's very bright very bright sunlight and that causes everything to kind of wash out right maybe i caught a cold when i chanted i don't know who would catch a cold from dude not even around other people just it just kind of feels overexposed that way so the sunlight off now it's like linear see we're going to talk the mathematics of lighting today but uh yeah this is the park demo and uh it's honestly really uh impressive like it's just a really well done i mean if you zoom all the way in on this you can see all the detail on the rocks and like pretty good just like a free demo yeah all right so you can see just how big this map is then while our next assignment be due next thursday nope um you're going to have all uh you're going to have all there's going to be a quiz view on thursday and that'll just be on the math we'll go over right now the math isn't too too bad we need to actually get you all tested up on the different math concepts let's run through that again one more time just as a review so 3 23 21 so we're gonna go into the math of lighting so how does light work you got a surface let's make it blue okay so you got a surface every surface has a vector pointing out of it it's at a 90 degree angle to the surface to the plane what is that vector called you guys remember here's my hand this vector is pointing out of it what's that vector called yeah so you're not normalizing anything um normal is the name of the uh annoying cat in uh garfield so it is called a normal vector very good stuff that is the normal vector that is different vector that is not the same thing as a normalized vector same word different meaning this mean it is of unit length and this one means it is a at a 90 degree angle at a 90 degree angle to the surface okay so the normal vector is used to determine how much light a surface gets so if you have what happens though when light hits a surface let's say you've got this blue square and you've got white light coming in [Music] what does the surface do what light gets reflected back off does it reflect green light when you look at it with your eyes do you see a blue surface looking green only yeah very good only blue white and i'll use shiny blue this time only blue light comes back off of it so what happens with a blue surface is a blue surface eats all non it's all non-blue white okay it absorbs the red in the green line all right and so let's say that you have a red surface over here and all this blue light is hitting it and you want to know all right well my eye is going to be looking here's my eye my eye is looking at the red surface here and the only light hitting the red surface is the light bouncing off the blue surface what color am i going to see if if a blue surface eats all non-blue light what does a red surface do what does a red surface do yeah hebron very good it eats all the non-red light is blue non-red abram yeah so it eats all of it so you see black you see nothing yeah so if you have white light hitting a blue surface and the blue light is reflecting off of that onto a red surface you're looking at the red surface it will appear pitch black okay so it eats all this eats all non-red light and that's blue it's not red it eats it okay so blue and red make black um so like if you have blue cellophane that only allows blue light through it and you put red a red cellophane over it you don't get purple that's what everyone thinks you're gonna get purple no you get black if you have a perfect cellophane surface that only allows blue through and you put a cellophane surface over that only allows red through no light comes through no light comes through so blue and blue and red make purple not with surfaces there's actually two different kinds of colors there are what are called additive colors additive additive colors and there are subtractive colors and we can call these lights and we can call these surfaces or paint why not okay so in order to produce a uh color that the human sees you need to have um you can you can use any combination of additive and subtractive surfaces you like there's got to be some additives or uh it's gonna be pitch black right okay so how does the math work well additive add additive colors add together subtractive colors subtract light hence the names right so if you have if you have a red light if you have a red light the red sun the red dwarf you have a red sun in the sky you got a blue sun in the sky it's a binary system no it's a trinary system you've got a red a green and a blue sun in the sky remember all colors are represented using rgb trios and they range from zero to one so zero to one zero to one zero to one okay zero zero zero that's red it's green it's blue zero zero zero is black one one one is white now there's other systems uh point five point five point five is great there's other systems uh with web development it ranges from zero to two five five that's very common also all you have to do to convert between the two is either divide divide by two pi five or multiply by two five five to go back and forth it doesn't really matter the math is easier when you do it this way so this would be let's see 0.5.5 0.5 this would be gray this would be 50 gray so if you have a red sun a green sun and a blue sun you're gonna get a hundred percent exposure of red hundred percent exposure of green 100 exposure of blue what is the sunlight going to look like around you what do you guys think assuming that the surfaces are exposed to all three of the sun's in the sky equally it's gonna look white because lights add together so if you're getting a hundred percent red hundred percent green hundreds of blue they add together and assuming they're all uh pretty much in the same spot in the sky it'll look white okay if there are different angles then what's going to happen is shadows are going to have colors in them right imagine if imagine if you had a tree get a tree this area down here is not no blue and the area over here is not going to have any green in it and the area over here is not going to have any red in it and so you can imagine there being shadows of different combinations of the different colors and stuff like that but if they're all in the same point then it's basically a white a white sun our sun's not white by the way sun's not actually white but if you expose enough red and green blue coming out of it and then i guess it's white alright so uh let's let's see if you guys can do a couple of these what color is this collins what do you think edward son you here what color do you think that is one zero one it is not yellow yellow would be one one zero um [Music] red rgb right so uh yellow is that old yellow okay so if you have one one zero it's yellow if you have one zero one it is they add together now what happens if you shine purple light on a blue surface so you got uh do i have a purple ink purple purple purple purple okay so let's say you've got this what happened here what is wrong with you all right more colors purple oh i have to pick from up here okay purple saturation 50 yes that's fine can i pick it can i pick it there we go all right so i got purple light coming in and it is hitting a blue surface uh let's see cha what color light comes off this is easy to demonstrate with a projector yeah what color light comes off cha if you have purple light shining on a blue surface and you're looking at it over here your eye is over here looking at it what color do you see chuck are you here all right lava what do you see see red you got red coming in you got blue coming in what does a blue surface do surfaces paints are subtractive so it eats all non blue yes and so you see blue light coming off so all the red coming in gets absorbed so that's a subtractive color so lights add together if you have red and green and blue you get white if you have red and blue you have purple they add together when they reflect off of the surface though they can only get dimmer so paints are always like a less than or equal to kind of thing right they can only have reduced brightness because they're not emissive right unless you have a glow in the dark paint it should be called an emissive surface in gaming emissive surface um then it glows but assuming it's just regular paint not pulling the dark paint it can only eat colors okay so uh let's do another one of these got purple light coming in this time it is on a green surface dollan what color light comes off green eats blue and red correct correct the answer is no color black exactly and if you have a perfect uh paint then literally no light would come off and you would see a void like the darkness in my soul right like vantablack which i think have i shown you guys vantablack before panther black all right the uh they coated the they coated the bean in uh downtown chicago with vanta black and it just looks like a hole in reality you know so it's normally this big reflective surface you coded in vantablack and it is just a hole in reality okay okay so uh yeah it looks like it yeah it looks like a glitch okay so what happens what happens what happens what happens to a white surface a perfect white surface what colors does a white surface eat it reflects all colors right it's a mirror right essentially why do we not see white walls like mirrors then it reflects everything all the photons coming in come back out if it's perfect white um you will purple light in purple light out why do we not see it as a mirror it's not shiny enough yeah exactly so what happens uh dull and very good is um if you zoom in if you zoom in really close on the surface of a of paint you'll see these they're these little balls of paint right and so the light coming in is actually going to reflect off in different directions it scatters the light and so what makes a mirror a mirror is it's smooth and so all the light coming in bounces off at exactly the same angle so your your uh your white walls are actually mirrors that just scatter the light in different directions they're rough and so in unreal engine this is called the roughness parameter and so if you had a white wall and you turn the roughness down to zero it turns into a mirror because it's perfectly reflective everything comes off at the same angle it comes in when it's rough though they bounce off at different angles and it breaks up the image okay yeah so all of your walls are actually mirrors just not very good ones let me check my hair it's handsome all right so uh yeah so that's just the roughness runner so if you turn it down you and uh you know in pain they actually have that they have glossy right they have glossy semi-gloss matte and that refers to the roughness of the paint and so if you have a glossy um if you have like a satin finish satin paint satin ultra let's see not very useful also not very useful um yeah you see how there's different shiny missiles i don't i'm not interested in buying product i want to just see what it looks like no that's not useful okay i guess that's good enough so you can see how it gets very shiny right and if you have like a ultra gloss on a car then it actually starts working like a mirror right see that so if you get a really nice uh coat of paint on your car and you polish it and wax it get a clear coat on it then you can actually get reflections coming off of it you can have that on your the walls of your house if you wanted nothing's stopping you it's a free country yeah so um when we we were we were painted our house a couple years ago uh one of the questions we had to ask ourselves is how shiny a house do we want and that's a weird question you know it's it's a question that never occurred to me before like how i don't know how shiny should it be like it's a weird question you know like fresno it gets really hot in the summertime so maybe we want it more shiny so that it reflects more light but then are we going to be blinding people across the street if we get like an ultra gloss like it's like this like a car you know like i don't know it's a weird it's just a weird question okay so let's get into the math of it so the way the math works is that you add up all the lights uh so step one skyscrapers are shiny true true yeah uh in fact uh the uh was it the vadara in vegas did you guys hear about that have you ever been to um like the cosmopolitan the city center in vegas are any of you guys vegas people maybe you're too young i don't know so uh in the four times we go to vegas yeah probably once a year or something like that and um the problem with the vidara is you can see it's a concave shape like that and so it worked and it's shiny and so what happens is it worked as a reflecting mirror and so the sun would reflect light off all these different mirrors down into the pool and it would actually burn people's skin and like if you left your your can of coke out like a bottle of coke it'd melt like it would look like the the lights reflecting off the vedara because this is vegas summertime it's already 130 degrees or whatever you know and then it goes you know like and it was melting bottles of coke and stuff like that it's called the vidara death ray and the area that it was burning was would move you know see melting the plastic bags and stuff like that yeah so that's uh that's you know an application real life the answer is applications yes but it's 24 a factor of 24. 24 is a factor of 24 yes but usually when you factorize a number 1 and 24 are not used but sometimes they are technically because the computer said find another factor of twenty five another factor group is twenty four i'm like one and twenty four one and twenty four is a factor group incorrect yeah yeah it's too easy it's too easy yeah all right was it archimedes or something like that he defended his town by making a death ray or something like that so in mythbusters i think tried it out i don't know i don't think they're their methods were good on that episode there so what is the math what is the math okay so first of all step one add up all the lights incident on the surface and this can be time consuming if you've got 100 lights in your level you need to go through all 100 lights trace a line to see if there's a clear line of sight between you and me if it's the sun the sun doesn't diminish in intensity depending on how far away you are from it at least on earth right when you have a directional light which is what we're talking about here with suns the further away if you're on mount everest or death valley doesn't matter technically like the angle of the earth matters more than how far you are away from uh the sun it doesn't vary very much uh but if you have like a uh your regular light bulb then the further away you get the light has fall off and so directional lights have no fall off ambient lights just light everything what is an ambient light what is an ambient light what does that mean ambient light you got an ambient light to a video game what are you doing is there is there such a thing as an ambient light in real life uh so you're just adding lighting to every point in the world and so oftentimes video games will do this because having a black screen drawn is not very interesting right like you're playing overwatch and you enter a room that and you close the door and there's no lights in there it's pitch black you literally can't see anything uh even when you move the mouse because there's no context you can't even see how far you're turning so like how do i turn around to get back out of the door right without the visual clues super annoying and so video games a lot of times will add what are called ambient lights which just add light to every pixel on the screen so it might just be like um it might just be like just lights every every point so for example it might just be like point one point one point one and if you have that then there will at least be ten percent lighting on every point in in the world so at least even if it should be pitch black you can still kind of see in the rooms a little bit and that that actually in real life is there is there a real life equivalent to that that it's trying to model is there such a thing as a ambient light in real life light that has no source or no direct source what do you guys think i always thought that ambient light was natural light yeah exactly that's exactly the the sun is the natural source of all light here's the problem if you are indoors the sun can't see me right there's a roof above my head the roof is opaque the roof allows no sunlight through so if you were doing a physically accurate video game what you do is you have i don't know my air conditioning remote control here and if you want to see how much light is incident on the surface you first of all take the lights from the i got a light above me here and i got the two monitors you can see it's picking up the light from the monitor you see it's picking up the light from the light bulb but it can't see the sun there is no line of sight between this surface and the sun however take a look at the open door behind me that's sunlight right that sunlight behind me and that is not exposed to the sun in any way that's at least two bounces away from the sun right so there's a window and then the window has to reflect off another surface then it's reflecting off that surface then it's coming over here so you guys are seeing like right there that sunspot that's actually sunlight and it's probably bounced about three times to get there and it's still bright enough that you can see you know all this stuff back there without it having any artificial lights at all so that would be ambient lighting right so ambient lighting represents the fact because you could do that with ray tracing right you could do ray tracing and have the sun shoot out millions of photons and have them scatter around the world randomly and create a global illumination field and some video games do do that but oftentimes it's cheaper to just be like you know what we're indoors on a sunny day there's going to be some light you know it's going to something's going to come in through the cracks and the windows and and uh you know through the living room and there's a skylight and all this stuff and there's just going to be some light you know what i mean and so ambient light reflects that sort of diffused sort of sunlight has kind of bounced around for a while kind of thing and you would not do that if you were on like the moon right if you're on the moon uh there's no atmosphere and so you know like light doesn't like it's very harsh if you ever see shots of what the moon looks like it's because there's none of that ambient lighting um 50 photos sticking on the moon right see it's very garish right there's this white black earth white you know like this is picking up some bounce lighting from the surface of the moon probably and you can see uh you know there's reflections off the guy's face here but the there's no atmosphere right so everything is just very stark and alien looking um right it's a it's a different so if you're in outer space you have to be careful with kind of this stuff right you see it's the shadows are just black right there's no ambient because this shadow here would be picking up light from the atmosphere right because the sun sunlight comes in and it diffuses around and then it bounces back and it bounces this way it bounces that way if you look at the shadows of these of the of the moon lander and the uh the astronauts they're just black and that's a weird you know it's a weird thing when you're used to being on the surface of the earth you know and so um um if you're doing stuff in outer space you have to be careful with this to get the right look but on earth yeah ambient lighting if you're indoors on a sunny day even at night have you guys ever like um um like when i was in my college dorms sometimes i'd have all the lights off and you can still the blinds are closed and i could still see my hand moving in front of my face right have you guys ever seen that like even at night time with all the blinds closed the lights off your computer shut down you guys ever seen that before like you can still kind of see enough that you can at least if you move your hand you can kind of see that habern has kind of yeah like if if you live in an apartment complex there's gonna be street lights outside you know the street lights are gonna send enough light in through your vertical blinds or curtains or whatever that there's gonna be a little bit of light coming in and that's gonna diffuse around the room a little bit and you'd still barely kind of see stuff you know if you ever go camping it's a different story but even camping there's the moon stars you know stuff like that if it's a new moon and you're outdoors and it's cloudy so you can't see the stars yeah it can be pretty dark it'd be pretty dark but during a full moon like a full moon is pretty bright have you ever been out camping during a full moon like it's bright enough to walk around and not not worry about tripping over stuff you know so we're actually as humans we're not used to being in pitch darkness have you guys ever been to boyden caverns in king's canyon it's um worth it's a worth a visit i've been there twice i went there in college um and then i went there again with my daughter about a year ago before the no two years ago at this point before the pandemic so a prospector found this cave on the side of a cliff and made it his home uh coveted guidelines all right so i guess it's open yeah it's pretty cool it's a neat it's a neat visit how much is it these days walking tour private extended walking tour that's cool and she's a private extended walking tour no dates no dates uh-huh 40 bucks not bad for a private extended walk um so when you the reason why i mentioned this is because when you go to boyd and cavern there's a point spoiler alert where they turn off all the lights you're deep within the cave you've been walking past stalactites and slack slag mites and all these cool sculptures formed by millions of years of dripping water with minerals in them and stuff like that and then they turn off all the lights and then your wallet disappears right um and so the first time i did it when i was in college they turned off all the lights and it blew me away because like i'm doing this right you're used to seeing at least some motion even at night time and i'm just like i can't see anything it is actually black and it is a weird feeling because you don't normally experience that so why does this matter when you're making a video game don't allow there to be pitch black right it's a weird disorienting feeling to actually have black so in my in my opinion if it's if you're on earth you know add some ambient light just because there's always photons bouncing around giving at least a little bit of illumination to a world it's it's actually unusual for you to be in what they called natural cave lighting have you guys ever seen natural cave lighting before no click now you have what if it was a scary game yeah yeah doom doom 3 did that a lot uh they would shut off all the lights and monsters would jump at you and the thing is like um zero zero zero black gives no information to the player and so you can like you're in a game and so when you move the mouse you need to know how far the camera is rotating so you can make decisions in real life even if my eyes are closed i can tell i'm rotating right because i've got an inner ear and the inner ear tracks that you've got prio perception in all of your joints your joints are constantly reporting back to your body as my hand closes my hand open you know humans have more than five senses right so um we do have five senses but we have more than five senses also and so it's really disorienting to be in pitch black like in the boydom caverns and so even if you're doing a horror game i would say add at least enough light uh that you the player can still navigate when they move their mouse they can see how far they're turning because it is again you don't you lack the inner ear and you lack free of reception and so that would be a place where the game is getting in the way of the enjoyment of the game and doom 3 did it really badly because you had to pull out your flashlight and the flashlight had a very narrow cone and it didn't do any bounce illumination so it's like this wedge of light the very sharp very delineated wedge of light which is unrealistic it should hit surfaces and bounce off and have some ambient lighting around it but instead it was like like that shot on the moon that's lit and so you had to sit there move your flashlight around trying to find where the damn monster is which was part of the point i guess but you couldn't shoot and have your flashlight out at the same time so you'd put your flashlight down pull out your gun start shooting and hope that you're shooting in the right direction because the monster could have moved you know and and so the flashes of your gunfire would illuminate the monster coming at you and so sometimes you'd fire bullets just to see where the damn thing is like it was just not a very well well made game in my opinion the most popular mod for doom 3 was a flashlight attachment to your gun like the doom marine has discovered duct tape duct tape the thing on so now some games you have to adjust your brightness to match an icon yeah um and that's to calibrate properly but really my point here is that you don't want to have black if you can avoid it it's not not very interesting okay and the second time i went to boyd and cavern they're like have you ever seen natural cave lighting click everyone takes out their cell phones and turns the flashlights on some people started taking pictures i was like freaking kidding me dude what are you taking a picture of the blackness like what the hell dude flashes going off the hell i want to have a memory of saying black i'm gonna get on my cell phone and photograph black yeah like five people like oh shining around i prep my daughter for i'm like don't be scared when it gets all black and she's like daddy why do those people have their cell phones out i'm like good girl she said it real loud okay so how do we do the math we add together all the light so if you got a um if you've got let's say a white light and it's a point light then it diminishes in strength right a light bulb if i'm a half mile away from a light bulb it's not going to contribute very much light you know what i mean so let's say that uh here the white light might be one one one here it might be point five point five point five and then out of the end it might be zero zero zero and those distances are you know controlled by variables right and there's different ways of computing it it's a inverse square law you know one over distance squared and some have linear falloff if you're like in a cylinder yeah linear falloff instead of don't worry too much about that the point is like there's gonna be some amount of contribution from every light near you okay the sun ambient lighting point light uh rectangular lights are the planar lights the monitors are casting planar light at me it doesn't really matter the point is you add them all together okay cap it up one saturated one and you'll end up with some color like let's say the color of light hitting my face right now kind of looks bluish okay so let's say it's like point six point seven point nine so let's say after adding together all of the different that's step one okay step one add together all of the lights and you end up with some amount of light incident on a surface step two multiply multiply by the color of the surface each channel separately okay so let's say the color of my skin oh that's a politically controversial question huh don't cancel me please all right um let's see paint new paste zoom in and we will use the eye drop tool i drop there okay there's my skin color all right it's 112 81.73 so dividing by 255s so what was it 112 8173 112 divided 255 is 0.43 81 divided by 5 is 3 2 and 73 divided by 255 is 0.27 all right there you go there's my skin color all right so if we want to find out what color bounces off my skin then you take the color of the incident light and multiply each of the channels separately so 0.6 times 0.43 point seven times point three two point nine times point two seven you guys understand so point six and i'm just going to copy down here point six point seven point eight what's that is that a bonus point nine nine okay so what you do is you just multiply each of the channels and that's how much light reflects off you guys understand so if this was zero and zero and one then it would reflect all the blue light and eat all the red and green light right but this is the more advanced understanding of it so you just multiply each of the channels separately so this is going to be 0.24 0.21.18 i'm not doing one significant digit okay you guys understand so the light reflecting off my face even though it was mostly bluish because my skin has more pink in it because i'm irish um apparently uh is uh more reddish do you guys see that so even though there is less red to begin with because my skin has a lot of pink in it then there is uh you multiply all the channels together separately that's the answer interesting interesting irish among many other things my my grandfather is a genealogist and i'm three eighths irish and a mix of a lot of other things for the other stuff as well so um well last name is kearney so it's easier all right so let's do another example well let's do yellow light one one zero yellow light reflecting off of a fifty percent purple surface if you have yellow light reflecting off a 0 50 this is 50 purple that's yellow if you have a purple surface 50 it's dark purple you shine yellow light at it what light do you see that's how we should start referring to skin colors from now on just the three numbers yeah you know it's not a bad idea because uh the uh the notion of there being five colors of humanity is itself a racist one right it was developed by racists to in the 1800s to justify white people being superior you know that's why there's white yellow red brown and black those are the five colors it's a racist concept and yet we still use that ontology that categorization of people even though it's kind of nonsense and even though the who's white and brown has changed over the years it's kind of kind of a silly system that we still use because we use it we still use it but it's frustrating 50 red okay so uh vacular okay one times point five okay so we'll end up with .5 red zero for the green zero for the blue yes we're going to get 50 red as the answer okay so [Music] let's do another one um 0.8 0.4 0.1 this is brown by the way brown's not a real color by the way brown's not a real color brown doesn't exist well what's your ethnicity in point 4.7.9 very blue i don't know yeah i mean honestly i'd prefer that system to the current one all right so uh brown is point eight point four point one and then let's go with uh let's do a color picker i mean ethnicity and race are also you know ethnicity refers to the country of origin of your family at least in america but race refers to one of the five colors of humanity which is just such a silly concept all right um blue i'm in a sorry color picker all right let's pick orange there we go so orange so we got brown light shining at an orange surface to 11 divided by 5 is 0.8 actually orange is pretty close to brown 0.8 uh 93 divided by 255 0.4 oh no oh no okay all right it's pretty pretty damn close to brown 80 40 00 yeah it's brown this is just yeah brown and orange are pretty close so what do we got if we shine brown light on orange light is actually probably closer to orange than brown anyway but what's your phenotype do you have dominant or submissive genes yeah it's yeah what kind of color are we gonna see it's amazing yeah what's really funny about the asari is that they appear different to every species that sees them they have a projection field that makes them look like an alien member but of the same species so my my wife always said that asari actually looked like broccoli in real life and they just appear to be human-ish uh yeah so the answer will be 0.6 or 0.64 whatever 0.1 0.16 and 0. or 0.2 if you want to round that way yeah so what would that look like um and look like that burgundy let's see it's not quite right actually 0.64 times 255 is 163. 0.16 times 355 is 40 and zero okay so that's the color you'll get kind of a brownish orange okay so before we had a bright orange now it's been darkened into kind of a dark orange people so um yeah you guys want to do one more before you take a quiz on it one more all right so try complimentary colors let's pick a give me some numbers give me some numbers toss out a number from zero to five 42 excellent choice 11 all right one more 66. all right there we go so it's this really kind of nauseous green color it's not it's not the worst kind of like almost that's more of an olive got like a little bit of an olive green color to it don't like it very much jungle color okay enter a color color snap visualizer all right here we go so that's our color all right upload your photo all right that's fine okay add a color here we go here we go search color yeah olive that's kind of it's kind of in between these two huh all right so let's paint the house and relentless olive i do the roof can't do the roof yeah that's that's pretty bad that's a really oliver stone that's a great name nighttime at night yeah it doesn't save it it's still it's still pretty bad all right so that's that's our color um so i like the name though oliver stone so the light is all over stone no wait that's our paint our paints it doesn't really matter which ones which so our paint is gonna be oliver stone which was um 32 divided by 255 is 0.6 0.16 and 66 divided by and what's the other one 11 11 25 is .04 oh four what color light do you guys want shining on oliver stone how do those color pickers work um you enter for the paint company or the one i was looking at before you basically just entered how much red how much blue how much green there's different ways of specifying it though like i'm using zero to one here you can also do hue saturation brightness uh hue of zero saturation of 200 there's different ways of doing these things right and they cmyk there's different ways of expressing the same colors so what color like rose color alright well okay sure we can use rows that works so that'll be 50 divided by 255 is 0.2 so we're going to shine rose-colored glasses in fact uh let's do that it's rose glasses we're looking at oliver stone which is the same thing as uh yeah sure we're looking at oliver stone through rose-colored glasses which are 0.5 and 63 63 63 divided by 0.25 okay all right so what color do we see if we look at this puke green color through rose-colored glasses there's probably some metaphor for modern life there that somebody could make what do we got take each of the channels multiply them separately what do you got so it's 0.16 0 times 0.5 so the first channel is not going to be 0. when we picked uh picking the color for our house too was the hardest part of it besides how shiny we wanted it to be um it's like you're gonna be staring at a color for the next i don't know 20 years i don't know ideally hopefully all right so why'd uh what color you like you know what i mean like our house was kind of a salmon color before which i really didn't like my daughter liked it he looks pink daddy like it's not pink it's salmon color so that is what you're going to see so if you look at puke green through rose-colored glasses you get kind of a warm red brown very dark very dark okay half the red light comes through a quarter of the other two channels the other two channels weren't too bright to begin with so it's gonna be like a really dark reddish brown okay it is nicer but it's pretty dark uh yeah it's gonna be 0.08.125 and 0.01 all right okay so that is how light works until until we get into angle of incidence so let's say that we have uh a surface and that's the normal and the light this is a light bulb and the light is shining directly on it like let's say the the video camera here is the source of the light and my my hand is facing directly at it that hand is going to pick up 100 of the light now what if i turn my hand 90 degrees how much of the light from the video camera is getting picked up by the front of my hand picking up all of it how much is getting picked up right now let's say it's like a sheet of paper right sheet of paper turned sideways picks up none of it picks up none of it the uh if you take a light bulb it'll catch all the light if it's facing it but if you turn the surface completely sideways to it all the light just passes right by you know what i mean if it's backwards then none of it's hitting so there is an equation for it and the equation is the dot product so unless it's reflected back so you dot product um in this case you take the dot product of the direction from the surface to the light and you dot product it with the normal vector so it's going to be the dot product of the normal the normal vector and the vector pointing at the light okay and um there's a lot of different ways of computing the dot product one way is x1 y1 was it x1 y2 plus that's x2 plus y1 y2 is the doctor and that'll return a number from negative one to one you guys remember that there's actually an easier way for doing light and it's just the cosine of theta so whatever the angle is between the the two vectors is how much light you get so if we have uh if we have let's say pure white light coming in and we have our surface at a 45 degree angle cosine of 45 degrees is equal to 45 degrees cosine is 0.707 of course we all knew that 0.71 then you just multiply the vector by the dot product and so rather than getting full pure white light we get point seven one point seven one point seven one in other words we have seventy one percent gray okay and as you turn the light uh that you turn the sheet more and more away from the light every day we stray further from the light the amount of light it picks up is less and less and less okay so at 90 degrees when it's perfectly perpendicular to it the cosine the cosine of 90 degrees is zero and you get black you get nothing sir good day okay so that is the equation for lighting one triangle in the world go through every light step one go through every light see how much that light contributes step two multiply the color of the light times the paint color step three now actually probably step one yeah let's be part of step one technically but if you only have one light um you uh you multiply the uh you multiply the uh light by the angle that it hits that's actually technically part of step one okay not really step three when you're figuring out how much each light contributes to the surface you multiply by the cosine of the angle okay so if you're outdoors in a sunny day and the light's shining on your hand and your the surface of your hands is pointing at the sun it's picking up 100 light as you tilt this as you tilt your hand away from the sun it gets less and less light you see that i've got a light up here it's picking up the light because it's pointed at it as i tilt it away it gets less when is the test dude the test will be do it on thursday and so we'll do this and i'll probably put in a couple review questions just so you guys can remember how to do the uh the other options scalar times vector is this one now do scalar times vector now to do vector dot vector dot product it's the inner product vector x vector the dot product is the cross product it's also called the outer product scalar transvector vector times vector vectors vector scalar times matrix multiply all the elements and matrix by the scalar it's pretty easy vector times matrix take the that's the hard one this is this is the one to study this one is easy this one is easy uh know what these view no no the dot product and cross product do um vector times matrix is the one to study and that's one where you take the vector turn it sideways multiply down add across you get another vector and then matrix times matrix matrix times matrix is this repeat it where you do it on each column are you posting your board this time you mean the the notes here sure i know distribute page group distribution unsupported great cool how to remove students manage classes is there a save option here can you just save a jpeg for me or something are you out of school we're basically done i'm just go i just want to share this with them uh sure there we go hidden by the video camera share send a copy of the page we need some more information no you don't you really don't any with a link no password apply to copy link there we go all right try this nope that's the that's the color try that see if that works for you guys wait no 2 8 2 a 4 2 2 a 420 b which is a fantastic hexadecimal code um 2a 420b did you do okay on your assignment with the hud uh that one i think was pretty awesome right wasn't it i'm remembering it right um yes fans yours was amazing sure yeah you you did the more advanced version of a hud so that's that's widgets and things like that we can add a widget to the to the screen and display and hide widgets and things like that like i said i i didn't go into that uh during our talk we did the most basic way of doing huds which is drawing a picture a line or a rectangle on the screen uh the widgets is the right way to do it it takes doing the umx stuff is umg stuff sorry is uh more involved though my my teaching philosophy is always to start simple and getting something working right once you get it to work then add complexity and professionalism as you can tell from our landscape that started off as green taffy used a widget yeah yeah it looks nice so does the notes work does that come up super fast look at that uh midterm thursday oh okay so you can view all of my notebooks all right well that's fine i got no secrets uh yeah here's the earlier lighting thanks for using office we made some privacy settings to give you more control and yeah go away okay um so here is today's notes i don't know what happened in night mode the hell dude why is it in day mode mine froze up i'll get there yeah where is night mode give feedback i don't like something default to night mode please there you go yeah it took a while to load for me too and it's my own notebook so uh just bear with it i think it's loading all of the notes that i've made ever and so there's probably a lot of stuff in there but um just click on is50a and you can see all the different notes ever so pretty cool pretty cool stuff all right well that's it for today guys uh we just did math today but this math will impact um anything you do in video games cause everything has lighting in it hopefully hopefully you don't do an all-black game that's just a black rectangle kind of a boring game i don't know what you could do with it but um that's it so i'll put up um i'll put up a quiz on i'll put up a quiz on lighting and i will give you guys a practice quiz maybe do you guys want a practice quiz on all the other stuff just to review things that help yeah um sure you know what i'll just i'll actually put up all of last semester's math quizzes and just set them to be worth no points and then you can just take them and then um the lighting stuff you should be able to do so there will be a lighting quiz and then i'll put up some practice quizzes for you and then on thursday before we go to spring break that's when your midterm is going to be and it'll just be on the math stuff because math is a quarter of your grade so make sure you do the practice quizzes and get comfortable with them and then there'll be a small midterm that you'll take over spring break and also you'll start probably working on your unreal projects over spring break too or not or just party spring break it's not be good all right so that's it for today guys um any questions math stuff once you understand it it's not too hard the hardest part is just kind of getting over the the hump of just understanding what it's about terminology neat i created a ray tracing stylized hatching shader it's really cool all right well that's it for today guys uh have fun do math be strong combat good luck", "D1wIzSbF0tU": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon everyone welcome back to adobe live today we are starting the week off with some great creativity with yulia nimka so please introduce yourself and uh what you're all about and what you've uh got to share with us yeah hi uh first of all thanks for having me um i'm julia nimka i'm a photographer based in berlin germany and i shoot everything around the theme of being outside and enjoying nature uh i photograph mostly with natural light but i don't want to be like in that one niche of just shooting portraits or travel it's uh i would say a wide variety of photography it's niches you could say nice so uh if you're just joining us over on youtube then feel free to stick around there but if you want to join in with the chat make sure you come and join us on behance and we'll be going through and uh keeping up with things i can see there's already uh quite a few people in there a lot of people starting off the week with some great creativity um lots of hello hellos uh sandrine anika stuart um oliver all sorts of people in there um so let's have a look through some of your work and your images because i am a big fan of your photography um i spent a lot of time browsing through your instagram and looking at all of the imagery and the color and there's something very interesting about the way that you work with color because to me the the images stand out as like a composition of things that are somewhat simple um and i mean that in the best possible way but the depth and the color and the the sort of character that comes out of the image just has me staring at the images for a long time um so i'm a big fan of your work and i'm looking forward to seeing how uh you sort of work with your color and how you go through your edits and um and things like that um so yeah if you've got any uh any things that you want to show on your instagram or your website just as like a a good sort of um starting point of looking at things because i think your work just it really carries itself so well i want people to see this well first of all thanks uh so much for yeah for the compliment um yeah uh maybe let's just start with uh with my website um i think here you can just get a good overview of the kind of work that i do and the colors that i tend to work with um so i think one thing that's kind of defining my style is going for warmer tones and at the same time trying to create timeless images um and i feel like in the past i used to use presets all the time and crazy filters back then with like hipster medic and instagram filters and everything and yeah i just uh what i like to do is revisit my work and look at the work that i created years ago and one thing i realized was that usually after a few years i wasn't really happy with the editing that i did i felt like it was too um yeah too much uh like tied around uh the the look that was modern at the time yeah and i think what i was trying to do is like go for a little more timeless look uh and classic look and at the same time still find my own way of handling colors and yeah and i think that's uh what i've been trying to do and in the past few years with my work that's one thing i always always think back to when uh especially when you're learning photography and starting out and for those who are maybe progressing fast if you're not looking back and thinking oh what was i doing back then then you're probably not progressing um so that's definitely like a good way of looking at your work but i mean your images are beautiful and there's some amazing locations in there as well um but yeah the warmer tones is definitely something that is very noticeable is that something that you work with uh in terms of the sort of weather are you drawn to sort of warmer environments or do you just try and take a scene into a warmer sort of style um i think the second so because i feel like i i usually tend to go to uh like colder places like i loved being on the lofoten islands and in iceland um and like all of great britain like scotland and especially whenever i'm hiking i usually go to to colder places to hike um but i think then the the [Music] i think rather than the environment i'm in it's uh the light that i tend to photograph in so like as you can see here for example i absolutely love having the like the golden evening light um or as you can see here um and i think that maybe is one of the reasons why the tones are warmer instead of the the location itself um yeah and i think that's also some something that defines your style you know the kind of light you usually shoot in or you love shooting in um is also i mean it's in photography it's all about light so uh yeah the time of the day you choose for for uh photographing is i personally think a key for the style you go for yeah definitely and then like you say it's not necessarily about a particular time is the right time to shoot it's just knowing what is your particular time to go and shoot in and if that happens to be golden hour then golden hour is what you enjoy is what you feel inspired by and yeah i know i'm definitely in that in that group as well yeah exactly but then i think at the same time it's also important not to just stick to that certain time of the day and instead also you know photograph at other times of the day because i feel otherwise you're losing a lot of opportunity for yeah for other images as well um so yeah i mean when i was starting out with photography i was photographing basically everything at every time of the day and then by yeah as the years went by i just realized okay i feel more drawn to like you said the golden hour and warmer tones and having harsh shadows um and maybe photographing more in backlight stuff like that yeah are you more of a morning person or an evening person uh depends on the season okay so i mean in winter i'm i'm more of an evening person and in summer uh yeah i just can't wait to get up early and uh and see how the day awakes and how there's just new ways for photographing and being out there yeah i love it uh i noticed there was an image in there as well the um there was an adobe splash screen that was uh oh yeah lightroom is that right yeah yeah yeah that was uh crazy for sure um you know every time i opened up lightroom i would see that photo and actually it was a self-portrait that i did a few years ago for uh for just a project that i did where i was kind of stuck with photography and i uh and i didn't really know like what to photograph and i felt like i should just have the challenge to create an image every day and then it somehow turned out to be a self-portrait uh project and yeah and that was back in 2014 uh and yeah then some years ago adobe reached out to me and said you know what we want to have that as the splash screen so yeah that was crazy for sure uh speaking of which should we jump over into lightroom and uh see some editing styles we've already got a question in here of asking what camera you're shooting with um so i shoot with the canon eos r uh no canon eos r5 um and i just uh bought the uh the leica q2 as well uh which is i'm dreaming about this camera yeah it's uh it's yeah i feel like in the past few months uh as there was not really a way to like uh travel far away uh and explore new places i felt like i wanna be able to to photograph more in daily life and uh and have a camera that i can just take with me all the time um and i was yeah i just uh it's it's been a dream uh and i'm so glad i bought it in the end um and i've used it for i would say a month now um and it's just it's a perfect size uh you can like literally take it anywhere with you um and it has a fixed lens and it's just yeah i just love having that one lens and just focusing on shooting with that and it's uh it's been wonderful so whenever i go on a like walk during the day or uh meet up with a friend in the park or so i just take the camera with me and just photograph you know more of like daily life situations and i feel like that uh brought back the like the playful aspect of photographing because i feel especially when you're working as a photographer and you're making money out of your craft uh i feel like personally what happened to me is i i didn't really photograph anything else anymore like it was all just on commission um but yeah i'm so glad i have a camera that takes me into that mood again yeah definitely it's funny that as photographers you need that playful side to come back because it it does help both the commercial side and the personal side um yeah i just think of in the same way of someone who might be say a professional driver but they have their weekend car the the fun one that they'll run around with yeah yeah the the q2 ah such a great looking camera it's i know the the way a camera looks doesn't really affect the image quality but just having something that feels nice in your hand i'm sure just transcends uh through your images and especially when it's personal and taking pictures of your friends and out and about i'm sure that will really come through just in the connection you have to it oh yeah of course and also it's you know having such a small camera camera it's it's not very intimidating so whenever i photograph someone they're not like afraid of uh yeah of me taking photographs of them yeah that's also yeah and at the same time and then we can stop with talking about the camera but it's yeah it's it's also uh so uh i mean if you've seen my work before um i like go on hikes and i also like bike packing and stuff like that so um it's it's also a good camera for those kind of trips for more like the active trips and at the same time the uh the resolution is so big that in case that turns out to be a commercial uh like story in the end you can still use those kind of files because they're huge yeah nice all right but uh yeah let's let's jump to lightroom and what we have here are uh five images that i chose to show you guys today and show you how i edit them and also talk about my approach in editing in general all right so uh let's start with the first one so here we have an image that i took uh on a trip in california and that's uh mono lake at sunset or a little bit after sunset actually um quite a um a creepy looking structure it's like it's kind of a formation that's coming out from the water yeah well actually i never looked at it that way but it's right and in fact it's that's exactly what happens here uh so the uh the water level got lower like during the years and this rock formation here was within the lake like some hundred years ago but yeah as there is less and less water uh you now have those crazy looking rock formations uh close to the shore of the lake so yeah and i think what i loved about this image here is uh like how minimalistic it is in a way and i guess i'm also always drawn to uh reflections um and also i just loved how soft the light was at that time so yeah it's almost like a painting straight out of camera it's just it's already got that aesthetic to it yeah yeah that's right and yeah i think that's up front uh something uh i wanna address here is that um i do spend time on editing images but it's usually like one to two minutes so for me personally most of the work happens uh in camera and just making sure that i perfect my craft and the exposure and everything uh like already in camera um it's a good approach to have yeah but yeah i mean some people they just love spending hours and hours on like the editing part and going crazy with like adding elements and stuff um and i mean there's there's nothing wrong with that it's just uh yeah two different approaches i think um maybe i'm just gonna already show you the like the before where we're going to with the editing um so here you can see uh the before and after and that's what we will uh what we will go through now and i'm just going to show you uh how i'm going to edit this one so let's go back um so the first thing that i use usually do is as you may have recognized uh the aspect ratio that i choose is uh 4x3 um just because i think from for me personally it's it's a more harmonious uh aspect ratio um so that's what i usually go for um and that's the first first thing that i do is uh cropping the image and choosing uh what to integrate and whatnot um and then next up um i think most of the time what i do is i actually go in order off like the right panel here and like i said before i love warmer tones so what i do here is with the temperature temperature is go a lot more to the warm side of the temperature and one like kelvin number that i often use is sticks out 6500 so i'm just gonna go for that here um and then with the tint um i want to push a little bit more to magenta uh to underline the colors of the sunset we have here and and my approach with editing is uh i don't want to go too crazy with the edit um and just kind of like complement the truth or the setting i like that term complement the truth that's very poetic i like that yeah and and and at the same time photographing and just editing is such a personal uh thing to do and for me in a way i think the editing it always comes down to how i remember uh the the scenery and then uh yeah doing the edit the way i remember it and so what i do here uh i'm not gonna touch the exposure exposure or the contrast uh but i'm gonna lower the highlights and as i do that you can already see that you get a lot more warmth and a lot more even look to the image and um sometimes i know exactly where i want to go with the edit uh sometimes i don't but for this one i already know that i actually like having uh the like the rock formations even more as a silhouette so what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna lower the shadows as well which also adds a little bit more contrast here then with the whites i'm not really gonna touch these uh they're gonna affect the emit image quite a lot so i'm just gonna leave it like that and then what what i like to do here uh not always but sometimes is reduce the clarity um because i feel like it depends on the setting uh you're photographing but it can just add a little bit more atmosphere to the image and and reduce the like the digital look of the images yeah a little bit like having a um like a missed filter or like a fog or haze yeah exactly exactly um and then here what i like to do is uh bring up the vibrance a little bit i don't want to have the image too saturated uh but for this one i i just love having the rich colors then here with the tone curve i'm not going to touch this part here right now but then one part where i spent i would say most of the time probably is this area right here where i can just manipulate the colors and just get my personal look in a way so here when we go to hue usually what i like to do with the blue is pull that one a little bit more to cyan so i'm going to click on that one here and just see that i can get a little bit more to cyan and then with uh like with the yellow part i'm gonna check as well like how we can change the look so i could either go crazy crazy and have a little bit more to magenta or orange or the other way around have it more yellow but i think i'm just gonna go a little bit more to orange here surprisingly that's not um usually when you do such a extreme sort of difference on the scale that really ruins an image but that surprisingly is still held up pretty well yeah yeah that's right um it lends itself quite well to a wildly different color shift uh-huh yeah yeah i mean yeah you always have to make sure uh you're not destroying the image and doing that kind of edit and then also what i usually do while i'm editing an image is uh push the y button and check the before and after and make sure i'm not going totally crazy with the edit and yeah and as i can see now i'm already quite happy with the edit like i have more warmer tones um i have the like the rock formation a little bit more as a silhouette and i've been reducing the highlights and just adding overall more warmth to the image um but then for that one here when i click into the image a little bit closer you can see the chromatic aberration here and that's one thing i'm gonna uh reduce uh so usually and i just forgot to do that one uh usually i enable profile corrections right at the beginning and what that does is lightroom automatically recognize the kind of camera and lens you've been using for that one um and it just corrects automatically and then here with uh removing chromatic aberration so we can see the magenta and cyan or more like green here i'm gonna remove that and you can see how perfectly that's been removed so before and after and yeah that's pretty much what i would do for this image right here i'm just going to show you the before and after again um also what i love to do is push the l key and have no element that i see except for the two images yeah that's a great um great viewing mode actually i'd very rarely use that uh personally but that's a shortcut i need to kind of get into my muscle memory definitely quite often i'm i'm more of a before and after with the um the slash key just to see like over the same composition but side by side yeah yeah different way of seeing it yeah it's a very simple um but very tasteful edit uh i see what you mean about you don't go too far on things and i imagine if you weren't running through your thought process on it you'd probably whip through that really quick yeah um so yeah um i mean i think that one for me personally is is an easy image to edit because i already have a kind of light situation and the kind of tones that i usually go for and that i love um to capture and i think that's why this this image was in a way very easy for me to edit um and yeah i just uh one thing that i almost always do is like reduce the highlights and just get a more even look in the image instead of having like the the super harsh contrast and and like the very digital look um and yeah i think uh i don't know if like that still influence influences me but back then i started uh photographing uh when when there was still analog photography so so i'm a freelance photographer for three years now but i've been photographing for over 15 years and yeah i think i just still love the more of like the analog aesthetics um yeah and try to go for that timeless factor to that definitely yeah exactly even with the um just the crop of choosing a 4x3 that's obviously very synonymous with medium format and um just older larger film cameras is that something that has kind of come to your attention through older cameras or is it just a happy accident that happened one day um that's a good question i think it's it just happened one day um i think i did shoot with like medium format cameras um and i still have uh some old cameras that i like to use from time to time um but yeah i think it just started somehow that i cropped the image with like 4x3 and then the more i used the 4x3 the more my eyes got used to it so now that's the thing that i just always do and that i feel is it's like more harmonious uh when looking at the image itself yeah nice uh let's head to the second one here uh where's this that's uh the lofoten islands in norway uh i'd love to go to norway so much it's yeah it's it's a stunning country and the landscape is yeah it's just might decide if i'd rather be there in winter or in summer either with all of the snow and uh the sort of cold crisp area uh or with the extended daylight hours and that sort of warm glowing hues everywhere i probably have to go twice to be honest yeah that's what i was gonna say yeah i think you should go twice so uh for the lofoten island i went there uh in winter obviously uh which was wonderful because uh um yeah i could see uh the what's it called polar polar light oh the northern lights yeah the northern lights so i saw the northern lights when i was there um which is just a wonderful uh and spectacular thing to see um but then also i went to norway a few few years before this trip and went hiking in in more like the middle part of norway and that was wonderful as well so it's yeah it's just hard to decide and i mean for the lofoten island itself i felt being there in wintertime was probably good because i think well obviously not now but it is definitely getting more crowded um and a popular destination but uh if you want to go somewhere else that's not so crowded but just as spectacular as the la foten islands i i would recommend checking out zenya s-e-n-j-a which is a beautiful island close uh to the lofoten islands and it's yeah it's just as wonderful as vilophoton islands i'm gonna make a note of that right now before i forget um yeah of course so um here we have an image shot during blue hour and what i like about this image here is how pretty much like with the first image you have the reflection here of the like beautiful shaped mountain and then also having the scale of the place with the buildings close to the mountains i think that's something i'm always drawn to to um to kind of capture the uh the dimensions um and just having imagine an image like this printed and massive you could spend so much time just looking in and inspecting all the smaller details and um i mean seeing it as it is on my screen right now it's pretty small and i wouldn't have known that there was like a village down there yeah yeah it's an amazing amount of detail yeah and it's uh and for example here you can see the bridge you're crossing when you yeah when you go by car and it's and having the lights already on here um yeah i think that just adds to the image itself do you shoot mostly handheld or do you use tripods at all mostly handheld yeah because i just i think the way i work is i i don't go to a place and wait for uh the the kind of light or um the composition instead i'm i just love to be flexible uh when i'm yeah when i'm traveling or when i'm photographing and just seeing this and for example the scenery so i was driving my car the rental car um and i would see a bridge um and i could already imagine that probably there's like a good viewpoint to like see this kind of mountain so i would just uh stop there and just hop out of the car and just photograph that i mean let's have a look so i was shooting that one uh yeah with a pretty open aperture and iso 200 and the yeah that was definitely handheld and easy to to hold and that's a sigma lens right yeah yeah it is yeah i actually don't have it anymore all right so i now have like the 16 to 35 millimeter um because i sometimes i felt like i need a wider lens and then also have like the 35 millimeter as a uh just as a good lens itself but yeah interesting to see i shot it with that one um yeah so for that one um i next to shooting during golden night i absolutely love shooting during blue hour and just having uh like an overall blue touch to the scenery um and i think that's something i'm just gonna switch but here you can see for example here as well or on my website images at the bottom we have a few blue hour shots here as well and i think it's just a very interesting time of the day because you still have like all the texture and all the information but you can definitely see it's it uh it changes to to rather night time yeah it's like night time with the lights on it's yeah it's kind of naturally bright for you but it is seemingly dark yeah yeah exactly um and yeah for that one uh i'm just gonna start with uh the aspect ratio again um and i tend to um have the image in the center like the the the main object in the center of the image and i think i'm just just always drawn to symmetry um and more of of the central perspective and you know like watching the wes anders movies for example and having the the symmetry and like the just the balance in each of his shots uh has been just a huge influence and inspiration for me and even the the warmer color palette that's a very weather anderson aspect with the sort of softer detail on the uh lower contrast and things um yeah it's definitely an inspirational view of things i love western films yeah yeah totally um so with that one um i'm just gonna do the same here uh go in order and with the temperature i'm gonna uh go a little bit more to the colder side here and just to make the image even a little bit colder but then later i'm gonna yeah manipulate the blues as you can see in just a second um then here with the exposure um i'm gonna rise the exposure just a little bit to make the image pop a little bit more um but then with the highlights i'm gonna lower these again a little bit i just love having you know especially with an image like that where you have a lot of sky um which is more of the brighter part of the image reducing those i feel like makes just the image a little bit more harmonious and then here with the shadows i'm going to rise the shadows here because i do like all the information like you said before having all this information in the image itself and then with the whites and blacks i'm not gonna touch these here and then i think i'm just going to leave it here with texture and clarity i'm not going to touch this one here because i already feel like having the very open uh already gives a nice and soft look to the image and then here what i do again to kind of just add my personal touch to it is go a little bit more to cyan uh as you can see here if you go too crazy you're gonna change the image totally uh so here uh i think i'm gonna go with this here and also sometimes what i like to do is use the the like the switch here uh and just see how i've been changing the image uh with this part and uh i'm gonna check for a luminance here uh and sometimes i do know already how that's gonna affect the image and sometimes it's just uh playing around and seeing if i wanna like change something here or not so uh you don't i don't think you always have to have a vision of where you want to go to uh with your edit it's just nice to play and experiment and see what plans out yeah exactly um yeah so i'm gonna brighten the blue parts a little bit um i like how that turns out um and sometimes what i do here uh i'm just gonna check how that's gonna affect the image i'm going to focus on the shadows and make those even more blue and to do so i'm going to use this part here and as you can see depending on the color you choose you're gonna change the image heavily and also with how saturated it is you're gonna change that as well i think i would do it like that i'm just going to check how much that's done and mainly you can see the effect here in the darker parts of the image image in the shadows um [Music] and yeah i just like how that affects the image and i guess this really accentuates that blue hour it's just telling that narrative of the time of the day just immediately yeah um and here uh i don't think i'm gonna use the the profile correction because i like the kind of vignette that you get here uh i'm just gonna check how that would look like with the before and after yeah and actually i do like how this image looks without having the profile corrections so it's definitely adding a lot of drama and yeah yeah really does add to it doesn't it i think so too so yeah there's there's like there's no need to use the profile corrections all the time um and yeah i just like how how that turned out um there's some mentions in the chat about the detail in this image i think everyone's just a bit blown away of how much detail there is yeah that's cool yeah happy to hear um it's yeah i think i just like having images where you know the longer you look at them the the more uh you can find um and just having an image where you can rest and and just wander around with your eyes and um and yeah so here uh you can see the before and after again um and it's yeah it's again it's it's not a heavy edit it's just uh you know making sure i'm sticking with my look and with how i like to have the colors and you know manipulating the blues here does most of the job already because uh that's that's mainly what we got here uh because of the blue hour is this um is this type of image that you only got a couple of or did you spend a lot of time capturing different scenes around here were you on the move i'm here so i think i was shooting like five to ten images of this location so i'm really more of a person that's like on the move [Music] sometimes i go crazy with a location when i'm like totally blown away but blown away by the scenery and i just want to capture it make sure i um i didn't screw it up um but yeah for this one um [Music] i wish i had the the external drive with the files with me it's it's uh maybe if we have some time at the end i can show you the uh lightroom catalog with the images from this uh location and then then just show you uh the different images that i took of the location um but yeah what i sometimes it's you know the the first image that i take at a location that's the best and sometimes um i i need a moment and and take a few images and then uh have the best image at the end so there's no like correct way of of photographing the location it's just uh yeah for me it's what's important is to like to be flexible to move around to play with the angle and also with a kind of lens because here for example you could also just focus totally on the dimension and just photograph the mountain itself with like a telephoto so yeah there's always multiple ways of just capturing one place i can imagine um if actually what's the resolution of this because i can imagine you could crop in and you could almost create a still a very printable image um with more detail zoomed in if you if you were uh yeah i guess so i mean yeah the resolution is absolutely high enough to have a cropped version as well um of course there is just so much detail it's amazing yeah um should we hop off uh like to the up to the next image yeah um so um here we have one um that i took in iceland um and i think usually what i do is i uh i like to focus on one aspect of the place that catches my attention and then this uh and in this example uh it's it's been uh just the the coastline and the you know having the ocean uh meeting the like the black sand beach and there there are also a lot of other images that i took of this place uh having like the whole scenery in the image but at the end i was just totally drawn to uh to having this like very minimalistic approach of capturing the place and just having uh the ocean and the beach and and the beautiful like highlights here of of the waves uh meeting the beach is this taken with the i can see it's a canon image but is that from a helicopter uh no it's it's not it's um it's uh from from like a cliff um so you can hike up a little bit and you can see uh yeah you can have that view uh to to this i don't actually know the name of the beach um but yeah i think the um just the like you said the the angle is is very interesting and that's definitely very dramatic yeah yeah honestly at first i thought it was a drone image but then i saw it as a dot cr2 or maybe you maybe had a helicopter ride which would have been spectacular around that oh yeah yeah i would love that i i haven't done a helicopter right yet so that's so much fun yeah i can imagine it's definitely on my list so one day um i'd love that um yeah so for that one um i i've been going a little bit crazy with the edit here i can show you the after just to show you how i've been adding this image in a way and i think what what i felt what the camera wasn't really able to capture is like that the ocean actually was blue so here it almost looks like a monochrome uh image like a black and white one um but what i want to do with the edit is make sure i'm getting the blues back off the water um and yeah and just having i'm sorry i don't know if you can hear my cat screaming in the background i can't hear that at all okay good um so um what i'm gonna do first again is have the image cropped a little bit and then i think i wanna have the upper part here because i like how like because of the perspectives the waves are getting like smaller and smaller um also i think it's it looks quite dramatic because i shot it with the telephoto and just yeah um which kind of changes how uh like i feel like shooting with the telephoto plays with the dimensions of a place and yeah i i would say probably 50 to 60 percent of the images that i shoot in landscape photography are shot with a telephoto yeah it's a there's a lot of purists out there who would disagree with that but i'm totally on your side i love shooting with a telly even with um shooting in wider apertures for landscape sometimes just the the nature of the scene the amount of light available just dictates the fact that you need to use a wider aperture and yes um if you were to you know decide not to take an image because you couldn't reach your certain minimum aperture requirements then you've missed that image sometimes you you know the the scene just dictates it but yeah shooting with the telly i'm a big fan of that definitely nice yeah um so for that one uh i'm gonna start like i said i want to get the the blues back but also having this one um just like the one before a little bit more colder um well it's funny because we were talking about how i like having warmer tones in my images but i'm showing you examples of colder ones but yeah um so i think what i'm gonna do first here uh is use the gradient filter um and what i wanna do here is focus on on the water side and then focus on the beach side here so for the gradient filter what i will do here is i will use it and then i'm going to check how you know what part of the image is affected by the gradient filter and then i'm going to reduce the temperature of this part and what it automatically did because i think it was saved somewhere is it uh it's been playing with the exposure but yeah i'm gonna just leave it like that make this part a little bit brighter and um when we come to this part here i can affect the color of the ocean again and just like with the other images um i'm gonna have this a little bit more cyan here and you can just add multiple little gradient filters to the image itself and i think what i'm going to do here as well is have another one um that's gonna affect the beach and for that one i'm gonna reduce the exposure a little bit um you could and that would probably be the same use the shadows and just reduce the shadows and the blacks because that's you know that part is mainly dark and just making sure i'm just affecting that part and that the waves itself um and yeah i think i'm just gonna i want to add a little bit more drama to the already dramatic uh scenery here and i'm quite happy with how that turned out here um and then what i like in this image is the the waves and instead of lowering the highlights here uh i'm gonna brighten them a little bit but which also already adds a little bit more contrast to the scenery it makes it a bit crisper doesn't it just kind of pops it a bit more yeah yeah exactly uh you could also use like the d-haze here um but then you also get a lot more structure in the water um and i don't want to have that change here so i'm just going to have the highlights here and then i'm going to check for if i want to make the shadows even darker maybe just a little bit because i don't want to look at have it i mean i i still want to have like a natural look to the image um so you know uh checking the before and after in between or during during the editing process um yeah like i said before it's just really important um and i'm just gonna check if i'm happy with how the blue is like and actually yeah i'm just pretty happy with how that turned out i'm gonna check what the luminance does here and as you can see that's going to affect the image quite heavily and i'm going to bring up the luminance of the blue parts a little bit just to make the image pop a little bit more um and then i think for what i can see now i'm pretty happy with how the edit turns out i think that itself is is a good example of how like within lightroom you can just edit your images also like with just partial editing and i'm just yeah i have to say i almost never hop to photoshop anymore because i can do like almost anything uh in lightroom and just having that kind of option to focus on a certain part of the image is just awesome i actually find that i've i edit so many more images since using lightroom i've used photoshop for editing photos in maybe six seven years now or so um and having that sort of catalog into editing process it allows me to edit my alternate images and i think oh let's see how this looks with you know a slightly different composition it just gives you a bit more choice but at the same time too much choice leaves you thinking well i can't decide between the two yeah that's correct yeah and also i mean one thing that i absolutely love is like how you can just create your own presets and just be a lot quicker with the edit uh when you're when you have a set of images that you want to edit um and i think usually what i do is like whenever i come back from a trip um i i create a new catalog for that trip um and then either i have a preset that i created in the past that's gonna work well with the location or i'm just gonna create a new one and then add the uh the presets to to the images of the set itself um and uh i can actually wes anderson looking scene yeah yeah um and for that one for example i can show you a preset that i remember that i created uh for this scenery um and i think that's the one that i use mostly for like images around that kind of light um and just scenery um how long did you wait for someone to walk through it doesn't look like there's much foot traffic through there uh it's actually it's my girlfriend so we were uh traveling together and uh i didn't tell her to walk there uh she was just she was walking there um and here you can still you can still see a car that's parked so here there's a little like parking lot and i think she was just you know walking towards there checking out uh the like the look the overview that you have when standing here because from here you can look down to the valley so it's actually uh yeah it's a nice viewpoint here and i was just uh checking out a glacier that's behind me um and then i was turning around seeing her walking past the the hotel and yeah like i said before i just love capturing something where you can you know see the scale uh of a place and then at the same time i feel like uh people are drawn to images where there's some kind of human element to it um you know and just feeling like oh yeah i would just love to walk there myself and uh and just be there um and yeah so i mean i can i see we only have a few minutes left here um if you want to i could also just uh quickly go through each step that i did here for the edit and so we have the the cropping uh at the beginning again making sure that i have the right angle especially when i'm shooting buildings i want to make sure that the lines are correct and then here i'm going for warmer tones for sure and then with the tint uh going a little bit uh towards the green to uh to underline the green uh window things uh thingies i don't know what these are called actually i guess is the yeah oh yeah yeah that makes sense um those are like they actually do work as well sometimes they're they're just there for decoration yeah yeah i think a natural traditional one i think these work actually you're right um and then yeah like you could see i was you know reducing the highlights making sure i just underlined the blue of the sky um bringing up the shadows to get enough uh information of the mountains here um and then here let's see what these did so um what i was doing here is uh playing with this part again of the image um so i was adding more warmth to the highlights just to underline the already warm light we have here um and then with the shadows i was going a little bit more to towards colder tones uh and and that kind of split toning just uh you know having like a colder part for the shadows and maybe a warmer part for the highlights uh just makes like gives a nice balance to the colors within an image um and yeah that's that's what i did here so here we actually have a quite complex image uh with like a lot of different parts which are like in the shadows and then highlights and a lot of mid-tones and still the blue off the sky just getting a more even look it's almost like a cross-processing um like processing for slides but with analog film it's sort of bringing that especially with that sort of blue cyan sort of hint to it yeah and then here what i was doing here so making sure that i remove the chromatic aberration checking what the lens correction does here so you can see the big difference in the lower part of the image here and yeah i was just choosing for having the lens correction here um and then sometimes uh i just revisit the like the first parts of the edit like the exposure etc and make sure that at the end i get to the yeah maybe like uh make the edit a bit more stronger um and add more contrast or stuff like that to the image itself um and yeah so here you you see the before and after um and and you know the the the way i remember the scenery was a lot more like this um you know because it was almost uh yeah it was going towards sunset and having the the harsh shadows here um but then the warm light um i was just yeah trying to to go towards that kind of edit uh and and the way i remember the scenery yeah lovely um we are just about at time on everything but these have been fantastic images uh to look at and uh it's it's been great to see your process both on the the cooler toned of things and also the the warmer toned um i mean this image in particular it's as you're going through it it feels subtle but then you look at it after you're like oh no this actually does have quite a difference in in the outcome but it feels so warm it's the type of scene that you could look at you could just imagine the sun on your back just kind of uh yeah just keeping the warmth and making it all nice and fuzzy inside yeah thank you thank you so much for sharing uh your images and your editing process um we've got a few sessions coming up for the rest of the week so i believe on wednesday it will be tim and robert uh going through some after effects and uh some special effects things which uh should be quite a fun session and towards the end of the week on friday i believe uh we've got i believe it was representative from off um going through designer to own studio so that is uh quite a cool session and once again those will be at 12 o'clock on v hunts and of course there is the disorder channel if you want to go and join discord and uh join in with the community in the

home in your own closet you don't need a lot of space you don't need a lot of power you can still grow some pretty good fire fire right in your own closet I haven't tried it yet I can't wait to get to it but all that dries we got some other stuff happening already too [Music] refreshing show you girls in the air getting nice and chunky chunky chunky momma's just how we like promised to keep this one pretty quick they move my hand out a way sorry about that I am tonight focused okay everything is coming along growing just beautifully very happy with this candy dog grow lots of other growers that are in the comparative growing this this this strain are reporting that one or two end up coming out much paler than the rest end up being taller but just overall looks hungry and that's exactly what you see over there see the contrast super dark green a lot lighter and they're both being fed the same stuff so just to show you different phenotypic 'el representations of a strain from the same seeds from the same pack quick glimpse at our photo periods this is that cross that I made super Lemon Haze with the OG 18 making this super Lemon OG these plants have been topped because yeah we just like to get them started early get them pushing out as soon as possible and they are looking very good just thriving off the side lighting that kind of falls down here more than enough to veg and

Limited's goodbye everyone [Music]", "X8wZMJ7kjY0": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review i got another new brand here that i've never tried um been seeing it out there quite a bit uh the mango taffy uh i'm not a big sativa guy so i've been kind of waiting to see uh an indica or a hybrid on the shelf so i found this one and picked it up uh it's the sapphire og by good buds i really like the jar right away um yeah it's glass uh super nice i really like it it's just got a nice shape it's super compact the right size for for an eighth so this one is sitting at 21.6 thc it was packaged january 21st 2021 so uh pretty fresh this one is actually kind of local to me because i'm in victoria british columbia and the good buds is actually in salt on salt spring island which is a cool little gulf island sapphire og is an indica dominant strain bred by crossing og kush and afghani the buds are said to be caked with sticky resin and trichomes with a pungent cheesy aroma everyone keeps mentioning and commenting on this that it's really cheesy and i love cheese so i'm excited and also hints of earth and lemon i couldn't find terpenes on this strain they actually don't have this particular strain on their website yet but i looked up the strain on leafly and other places like that so i found two that are potentially the dominant terpenes on the strain which are karyophylline and liminant those seem to be two reoccurring terpenes that i personally really like good buds is a small batch hand trimmed hang dried organically grown cultivator good buds is fvopa certified and is located in salt spring island bc like i said now this part is a little bit confusing to me although i'm not in the industry that way so i don't really know exactly how it works but uh from what i do know the fvopa is fraser valley organic association and uh i can't remember what the p stands for anyways i just figured that the organic certification would be you know salt spring island or british columbia even not exactly sure why it's fraser valley maybe they grow it on salt spring and then send it to fraser valley to be tested as an organic product but not exactly sure why uh it says that on there kind of threw me off a bit good buds products uh are apparently available in bc alberta saskatchewan manitoba and just recently ontario now so keep your eye out for it they are privately owned by the roomy brothers okay so let's get a look at it here like i said super nice jar very small and compact see if there's a seal here it's gotta be yeah super nice jar and again i love the glass jars for the fact that the seal just comes off very easily it's not like it's going to come off in shipping or anything like that but when you go to rip it off it just kind of peels off real nice and immediately it's got a very nice aroma definitely uh some cheesiness going on so i understand what everyone was saying now there's no humidity packing here but it was uh pretty freshly packed so i'm not too concerned about that but maybe in the future good buds we'll think about uh getting into that i think every lp should have a humidity pack in their jars um unless they have such a high turnover that the uh bud is you know only a month month or two old um okay guys so now that we've learned a little bit about sapphire og by good buds out of salt spring island last thing i got to do is test out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys uh after testing out the sapphire og by good buds uh really impressed with this one it's not super like heavy hitting uh sitting at 21.6 thc but uh gets the job done i found it to be a little bit of a creeper um but it works well for sure not a lot to knock on this one uh had a really good taste definitely cheesy like everyone says uh and i i definitely uh noticed it kind of tasted like uh has that og kush taste in there for sure which is in the lineage so it makes sense it was really smooth uh it's organic so it was very very clean the ash was super well and it burned really well so not a lot to knock on this one i would rate it a bit higher if it was um a little bit more sedating because it's not like a overwhelming uh strain but i really enjoyed it well done good buds i look forward to trying um i think they have like a god bud or something like that that's the wrong name but it looks really good so i'm excited to try it uh anyhow i'm gonna rate this sapphire og 9.2 out of 10. until next time guys", "A6rvbJchNdE": "what is going on everybody

"Hello, this is BangGogh. I'm going to use fabric paint today. I'm going to draw a picture on my dress. In the process of creating a YouTube channel, Not only your profile picture. I also need an image for the banner. I got it. I'm going to show you what I drew in the first video. Because I set it as a channel profile image. I also wanted to draw banner images. So this time, everybody's in the closet, or something. that might not be there at all. I took out my jean jacket. (Oh, that's not good.) I'm going to draw a picture on the back of the jean jacket. in line with the sewing machine I was planning to draw it inside the biggest square on the inside. The full size of the painting I'm going to draw today, The size of the space we're going to draw doesn't fit each other. I thought about it for a moment. The second drawing I'm going to draw today is... It's this familiar, also widely known as Van Gogh's paintings It's a starry night. a picture longer horizontally Distortion the proportion to fit the space you want to draw. It's a picture that doesn't lose anything in itself. I wanted to recreate it. Long up and down, narrow left and right. Would it be misunderstood as a channel to select only famous paintings and draw them on clothes or clothes? I was a little worried. I don't know if I can draw anything similar. I was worried. I just decided not to worry about anything. I drew the important parts first. Cypress trees, stars, and moons. And the flow of the atmosphere. So was the picture in the first video. The closer you look at Gogh's paintings, It's an incredible picture of perfection. It's a picture painted with countless strokes. And the color inside the stroke. painted in different concentrations It was a terrible picture. Like a TV or a monitor. In a narrow, narrow, multicolored space that is hard to see with your eyes. With programmed colors. It seemed like a picture was made. I can't believe I drew this with human hands. It was a huge gradation. But it's by the standards of the average person. At the Children's Art Competition to Reduce Traffic Accidents in Childhood For me, who won the Gold Medal as a representative of my grade, It was a challenge. (Oh, he's like this again.) It just means challenging. Aiming at perfection enough to be imitated. I drew a stroke and went in. this myriad strokes The shadows of the night sky and the stars in the painting It will express the flow of the atmosphere. To learn the secret behind the birth of a great painting, It's quite interesting. After Gogh argued with his friend Gauguin, As you can see from the ear-cut incident, His symptoms of mental illness are... It was serious. After all, Gogh had to be admitted to a mental hospital. I couldn't draw any more. The fact that you can't draw, I made it harder for Gogh. Gogh's brother and the biggest supporter of his life. Younger brother Theo. You know what's going on with your brother. not a mental hospital You'll need to work with your drawing and treatments. You'll find a nursing home. As many of you know, Gogh sold only one piece of work in his lifetime. in terms of one's income as a painter of the day He couldn't live. But Gogh's passion for painting was great. The reason why Gogh was able to continue painting is because My brother Theo was there. That's how the new nursing home life started. He was able to draw a lot of pictures. We've left a lot of pictures for us today. Of course, both Gogh and Theo face tragic deaths. It's true that your brother's story leaves you feeling sad. But what my brother Theo showed me at the time was, A simple affection for my beloved brother. It may have been a sad sense of responsibility, in the end, history I left a painter named Gogh. I also have a brother who supports the launch of my YouTube channel. Looking at Gogh and Theo, I think Gogh and I have the same fate. The location of the cypress trees and the location of the stars. The more I draw, the more I draw. It's different from the original plan. I had to make a few corrections. The most exhausting part of the time I was painting. It was a process. I don't know if it's the process of getting better. I don't think so. It wasn't a good time to judge for yourself. an unjudgmentable If you call Van Gogh Gogh, it's not right. What you call Gogh. My brother Vincent van Gogh and my brother Theo Van Gogh. What we call Gogh and Theo. Drawing on a jean jacket, making a jean jacket into a mop (GOTTING) I've made my own decisions. There are many times when right and wrong cannot be judged. (I made it out of a mop.) Van Gogh was in a nursing home. I left a lot of pictures on the theme of the surrounding natural scenery. The starry night also It's known as a landscape painting from the nursing home. It is also known as a painting that reflects Van Gogh's imagination a lot. the haze of nature along with him The light of the stars and the flow of the swirling atmosphere, from one's own eyes It looks more fantastic than it really is. Is it because it's fantastic? The more I draw, the more I draw, the more I draw. It's getting dazed. I don't even know what I'm drawing. Like a dream, like a sleepover. My own starry night. When you're drawing a village, Like Van Gogh, who painted it with more imagination. I also borrowed only the motifs of the painting. I started imagining the rest. The moment you turn on the light by the window, It was for a while. I felt ecstatic. (How far are you painting it?) the original French countryside I reinvented myself into my own moon town. (What's that?) (Cabbage patch) When you color cypress trees, It's morning. I had to go to work. The picture we face again is... It gives me a strange feeling. Sometimes we can't. I don't know what's left of the result. There are times when I pour out my passion. I know there's meaningless consequences left. I can't stop. in a wise way Sometimes by coercive behavior. Even if you try to stop me, I can't stop it. All you have to do is stop. It should be your choice. a stoppage courage At the end of this star,  I decided to stop painting. Actually, no more. I didn't know what to do. to be okay as it is to be nice Anyway I am (I'll wear) be in one's (mop) Actually, I like it. different from Van Gogh's. Something was drawn on the jacket. But I couldn't see it because it was painted on my back. out of regret one more I'm going to draw it. My own painting only for me. I'm going to draw it in proportion to the original. The picture that was distorted by the painting on the back. I'll give it back to the original rate. The picture of this wrist. I'm in a hurry to look at my watch in my busy life. to take a break The emotions of a beautiful country village. I might give it to you. Now The clothes are all set. This jacket is... It's still a jacket. a rural village in France with the twinkling stars in the night sky It's a special jacket. It's the right outfit to go out. Tonight. I'm going to see the stars. If you see a twinkling star in the night sky, The bright light in the future is still dark. You feel like you're here. Like a dream where you can't get caught. from far away The star twinkling at me. Tonight. Can I see the stars? But the world is still murky. It's only dark. I'll wear this jacket on a day like that. To a lot of people like me who are chasing stars. This jacket is... consolation and hope I'll be there. I'm sure he'd come up with it in a nursing home. Like Van Gogh's starry night. My night, too. It's going to shine. The moment you hang it in your room, in the corner of a small room a star-lit miracle Thank you for watching the long video. I'll come back to the next picture. It was BangGogh.", "ELXcvHbTHMw": "[Music] if you smoke it i got the haze and if you're hungry i got fillets let me tell you i thought i thought that anderson park said i got the ladies i did i had to listen to it twice i heard that he said yeah uh joe budden was going in on him about that and then mom was like i appreciate the late okay that's so much better okay i'm glad i'm not the only one because i sent out a whole tweet i was like lol anderson pockets hilarious i'm talking about i got the lace and then immediately i got a tweet i heard filets and i googled it i was like oh it's filets he deleted it he was like delete tweets [Music] [Laughter] i got everything that you need barbecue because in my head i was like that's so breezy over here to say i got the lace that wasn't it ah but yo what's good y'all welcome back to the no chaser podcast i'm tim chantaroni i'm ricky shucks i'm nikki blades i'm gonna change my name to tim trying to write sue [Laughter] [Music] now when i tell you um growing up i got tim got the wrong song tim no no tim chant the wrong song tim got the wrong soup tim chattanooga tim chimichanga tim um um everything did you guys ever get made fun of for your names i don't like my name name being on the internet right so i can't but yes yes okay nikki blades my name is nicole yeah and i'm the best all the dj's want to feel my breasts that is true um not i mean not really anytime you are an athlete your name's gonna get made fun of or people just try to find ways but not to the extent that you did my brother though my brother's name his first name is kahua okana kahua okohana they would call him coca-cola coca-cola kahlua kahuna okahana the big kahuna but that's though yeah but that's not his name they could call him kahua oh oh okay yo mama okay nobody was that creative growing up they was just they would just call them coca-cola but my brother's name got made fun of i didn't really get made fun of i had a very typical name nicole there's nothing special or fancy about it and blades didn't come in until college and then it was cool word yeah i mean as you know to be honest i'm thinking about it right now and in high school when people should have made fun of my last name they didn't like they didn't really make fun of my last name uh it was like yeah no no it was just tim what did the teacher say during role they would come think of it let me let me let me think about it uh they would say they would just i don't know they would just say uh tim chu and i'm like that's me oh you wouldn't even let them get out yeah i was like that's me who called you chantarengus chandarengus i don't know that was that was like later in life but i do remember let's talk about high school i remember uh specifically one time just when i think about high school and i think about teachers it has nothing to do with the names it's just a fun story that i love um uh thank you sorry i was looking at the hoodie i was like damn that's a nice ass hoodie make sure you get your goody brand yeah l.a does not equal hollywood people were complaining about how how much we charged until i got a home girl who dm me and she was like i finally was able to get one of your goody sweaters uh and they didn't sell out and i was like which one did you get and she was like the la not hollywood one and i was like oh okay i see you yeah because these are on the pricier side right and a lot of people were mad at us about that but when she got it she was like i see why these are this much she was like the quality is crazy it's there and then in person it's so different than online right because you never know and i was looking at you and i was listening to what you were saying but it kind of zoned out at the same time because i was looking at the quality of the material and i was like damn i just had to feel it and it's so different in person and the details and the fringe these aren't just a hoodie material not at all this is different we got hidden pockets on there yeah and each one is hand distressed right that's so yeah because i got into a little dabbled into the merch world and getting to see and i'm so familia i mean i was blowing up breakups like rick help me out here uh but as you see it in person this [ __ ] is like it looks soft but it also has like it's thick it's thick as [ __ ] this is not your regular stitching embroidery yeah the embroidery and then the um fringe i don't know if you guys can see but the distress you can't just get [ __ ] distressed without somebody doing that by hand yeah goody brand.com such a plug your shirt and then a side note your shirt is nice thank you super nice what about my pants oh my god look at those sweats oh the mickey blade sweats are popping the biggest compliment i got was when rick got the sweats and he put them on and what did you say i forgot but i love them you love them i don't remember what i said but they're comfortable as [ __ ] they fit like right yeah like the way you want like joggers almost but they're sweats yes i love these shits here sweats can be a struggle and the nikki blade sweats they fit very nicely um side note none of this was playing not at all no we're not making any of this [ __ ] up the [ __ ] is good i genuinely went and i touched tim's sweatshirt yeah if you guys aren't watching and you're just listening i reached over and i touched swim uh tim's sweatshirt and i looked at rick because i realized that i was on camera and rick was like you touched it why you touching a sweatshirt for and here's a funny quick little side note right somebody commented on my instagram and they were like i really loved the message of la not equaling hollywood but she was like they're so expensive and i feel like that's contradictory she's like i love the message that you guys are putting out that la doesn't equal hollywood but she's like but they're so expensive and i feel like that's contradictory of the message you're putting out i was like hold on a second boo uh i'm like first off thank you first of all first off thank you second of all uh the whole message was about people misconstruing that all the bouginess of hollywood was an la thing i'm like we can still say that la is real as [ __ ] and charge a lot for our goodies we didn't say l.a was broke to add to that i had people going on my site and they were telling me and comparing our brands it was like oh goody brands is way better and they're way cheaper and this is not the third i said first off please continue to support them because that's how i got a job because we got a job because they got jobs but then second of all uh a lot of people don't understand what goes into it and i didn't fully understand the the behind the scenes stuff until i started doing it the quality of the material the getting things stitched where you get a [ __ ] from the packaging just the overall price and to that person and to those people they don't realize what you guys put into it or what goes in like this product here and again not a plug but a plug that's not normal hoodie material do we have something else to talk about or can we go let's go end up you know i mean a lot of people ask about it because we got compared you know my brand and then your guys's which is well established and you guys do volumes and the numbers are completely different but people don't understand how it works um so everything has its own price you know i'm saying and some things that you would think shouldn't be as expensive as they are they just are these sweats for example you got two embroidery hits on here that already makes these more expensive than some just normal sweats you had to pay for the sweats these aren't cutting cell correct no okay so you had to pay for the sweats then you had to pay somebody to embroider you had to pay them to embroider twice and each one of these depending on what type of deal you got could be from two dollars if you got the hookup to like five dollars a piece on just one pair you know what i'm saying when you're selling clothes ideally you want to make three times what you paid and shipping is a mother [ __ ] bro

let me explain that to you okay so check it out so shipping and fulfillment right first of all if your business doesn't do a certain amount of orders you don't get price breaks with the postal service you're using you know what i'm saying and it's a significant amount of orders you know what i'm saying you can be doing 600 orders a month and still be paying a lot of [ __ ] money for that [ __ ] yeah what is this oh so a lot of these people who order free shipping passed a certain amount they're doing a lot of orders they it doesn't cost them that much to ship or they're getting their stuff done in like india or something like that and they're paying very little for it to be done so like they can afford to lose the money fashionable forever 21 [ __ ] yeah it's such a huge scale that's why the shipping is little yeah exactly it's like they're they're charging you six times what they paid so they don't have to charge you that much for shipping because they're getting your favorite dress that you just ordered they bought that for a dollar they charged you 25 for it and that's why they say free shipping after a certain price because they already took all your money yeah exactly so like this hoodie this is this is cut and so it's completely like we made a um like a stencil yeah yes this is fabric just printing a picture on a hoodie and in order to do that that goes through a whole process and so this design could be um trademarked and you go through the whole thing of where this is they own this yeah cut exactly yeah like we could do that but to do that it's expensive especially with the the quantity we did the way we did it just to make sure it got here in a timely manner all of that stuff it cost us a lot so the only way to make any profit you have to price it at what is priced at now a lot of times if you're a business who does a bunch of different pieces you can make stuff up you know what i'm saying what we used to do is a t-shirt a t-shirt we get it for a decent cost or whatever but a hat we get it for really cheap it's a flight so what we would do is we could put a t-shirt up for 25 where that's not making a lot of profit but a hat we could put it for 35 and that's making so much profit it makes up for the um the t-shirt and [ __ ] right and that's something y'all don't even realize people are willing to pay 40 50 60 for a hat depending on who it's from or they design on it and hats are probably the cheapest [ __ ] to make you know what i'm saying but you guys have these thoughts in your head that you know what's what yeah and you think the t-shirt needs to be cheap that [ __ ] was expensive the hoodie is expensive pants expensive this jersey expensive oh i'm sure so this jersey didn't even get put out yet because i wasn't happy with it by the way so the amount of time that goes into each piece and i know the guys can speak on this because you guys have put a lot of thought into it so my first drop everything was uh surrounded around the brand and then a certain image in in particular i wanted to drop these jerseys but unfortunately because of my budget and this was all coming out of my pocket i couldn't afford to drop these because i still wanted to add embroidery yeah and this is mine but what i would want to sell is the embroidery because i personally love custom mlb jerseys and it had to be done correctly so when the person that i was working with brought me these i said that's cool but i'm not selling this yeah and that just goes to show there's so many things that everybody has in their closets that is like this will never see the light of day because it's not good enough and this has blades on the back of it i think this one has blades on the back but i told them i said the next time it comes out i have to have it stitched and knowing the price of it i didn't know if anybody would actually buy them right that's the risk because it would be so expensive i wanted to come out with a letterman jacket and this one and i have them but if they don't sell i'm asked out and if i do custom orders that's way more expensive and then the shipping because the weight of a jacket it's just so much to consider but when people go online and then they compare other companies it's easy to say fashion nova because they're so well known and what they did is the uh fast fashion fast fashion came over but you know what's countering that is thrifting people have started thrifting a lot more but it also allows space for quality products to live and people to appreciate things that are going to last so i've seen rick in these sweats several times yes and the dick print is popping and it makes me so proud it makes me so proud every time i see a minute because the biggest compliment you can get is that nice dick it's that's it they were like yo nikki sweats makes the dick print look so good people like but a lot of my money went into packaging i wanted i wanted a really i wanted a good package a nice solid stiff package for you guys but that was another cost that i didn't even consider yeah i mean there's so much call everything costs like everything costs like that jersey um so with that's print right yeah this one's print so i have print on the sleeve print on the chest do you remember the cost they didn't even get to the cost when they brought this one because they said they wanted to just check it out first and it has print on the back yeah okay see so you got three print hits on a pretty it's a pretty uh good quality is it lined yeah okay so that's probably 17 before the print yeah you know what i'm saying if you got somebody who's good at sourcing probably get it for 16 14 lowest yeah and then you got to do the printing and [ __ ] right now the fact that it's printed is going to make people feel like it should be less right you going to want the application right less as opposed to [ __ ] um like stitched on yeah it's called applique is what they use for the jersey because like looking this as an example you have two different textures on one you know one hoodie yeah exactly uh the back it has a giant print on that too you know what i'm saying there's no way we was gonna [ __ ] uh embroider that [ __ ] you know but yeah they would want the applique patches on there and when you get to doing that you have to make sure that the jersey itself is a good quality to hold the patches because if you don't when you wash that [ __ ] it's gonna crinkle and we've dealt with that in the past so much [ __ ] but but that's what the public doesn't know right and i get it you don't know that but like if you if a brand that you like ever dropped something you like this is too [ __ ] expensive just shut up not to be a dick like that but it's like even if it's not for even if they're [ __ ] gouging you yeah you don't need it ah you know nowadays i don't be trying to go out i got this new baby i'm trying to be home be safe with the baby so i don't go out to eat like

chaser 10 promo code no chaser 10 terms apply fact you know what i'm saying like if you if you can't afford to buy what's the point of getting mad it's just like okay well i'm not gonna buy that [ __ ] well you remember when the jordans came out so a lot of the shoes started falling apart remember there was there was a certain year where the quality of it just went to [ __ ] and then all those shoes from that year they started falling apart the only good thing that happens from something like that when you bought it is that either the company itself fixes it fixes the problem and comes out with better quality or people go and they start paying more for older stuff that was made in a better year and then they just hold on to it yeah and you're like what the hell is going on and the price fluctuates because of the consumer not because of a lot of the people in the back it's what in demand yeah so i know these are not fake rick is gonna have to justify his shoes every time if y'all ever see me in some shattered backboards they are 100 fake 100 fake unless i get him for him for his birthday all right oh [ __ ] i might just do that when you see that price you go you're gonna change your money i'll be like damn do i like them then chatterback boys 11 and a half right yep okay don't deal done done so tim is going to go slide into some sneaker heads together i'll hit up all my

that true very true okay okay i like stickers too you get them for free [ __ ] you i don't care i still want it from you i want a birthday gift too all right we'll talk about it speaking of [ __ ] that these kids don't know about there was a dude i don't know how old he was he emailed me the other day talking about tim please can you put me in movies i'm trying to be an actor and i hit him back and i was like my dude i've been grinding for 15 years and i'm barely getting into like any type of like i have like five ten minute scenes in movies dog my guy i've been in like i've i've been doing i've been at this [ __ ] for like oh like a decade and a half yeah and i'm barely in this [ __ ] right and i'm like bro do you have a a a a reel of your acting credentials do you have skits do you have something do you have anything and literally dog his reply his email was i just thought that you had to know people to get on in hollywood right and i'm like okay look that definitely helps but also you don't know me but you don't know me yeah and what like i'm trying i'm i've been in this [ __ ] and i'm i'm barely getting my foot in the door you know what i'm saying like what do you think i'm gonna help you do and he's like and he was like bro he was like man i just thought that like i could like email you and and no no this is literally what he said he said i've just been emailing people that have clout and seeing if they could help me out and i was like kid i like first of all bro you got to put in the work yeah you got to be able to like i'm like i've been doing this [ __ ] for like over 10 years i've been going on mad auditions i've been like i took improv classes i was in theater and i've been doing this [ __ ] i did mad auditions that led to nothing nothing i've been on meetings that went nowhere and like and i'm barely even kind of fitting into where i'm trying to get into you know what i'm saying i'm like and i feel like these these [ __ ] i'm like what why why you know why because they see people from social media that get opportunities and they just assume it's about who you know and a lot of those people that get the opportunities people don't realize they put in so much work that they don't talk about and then or they're talented or they're talented and a lot of it is like well what do you bring to the table cool like okay so you hit enough people so you at least have some sort of drive right like okay cool you got initiative damn that that's literally like going to a go see if you directed your energy in the proper places you might actually get somewhere yes let's talk about that model [ __ ] go sees go see let's talk about this that i've only ever heard about on america's next topic okay wait before you get into that yeah next time someone asks you that just say yes and nothing else can you put me in movies yes yes um okay nicky blades as as a model who's been doing a thing maxim model before the whole ig model [ __ ] was a thing um let's say you had a a young girl hit you up and i was like i want to be a model put me on in 20 and 20 20 21 20 now okay um and uh like tell us about your struggles as a going on go sees as like a model in the industry compared to let's say someone who is now a quote unquote uh instagram mod okay so first off the whole industry changed a couple years ago where instagram became a vital part of the industry but before that you would have to go and find uh go to an open call so what an open call is is that certain agencies and they all have different levels you have a talent agency you have commercial commercial and then you have high fashion so you also need to know yourself well enough to figure out which one you probably fit in which a lot of people get their feelings hurt because they go towards things they are not fit for the fashion industry in the modeling industry doesn't give a [ __ ] about how you feel they care about what you look like in your statistics like how tall are you with your waist with your bust these certain things so back in the day you would have to go to an open call or you would submit online an open call is like say wednesdays ford modeling would have an opening to people that would be able to walk in scouts would look at them and decide whether or not they would want to see them again were yeah so you would you have opportunities all of these places still have open calls all you need to do is go to the website and they will give you all the answers right there so say you weren't able to go to an open call you were able to submit online all they would ask for is very simple you never needed a portfolio all you needed was a snapshot of your your straight on headshot your quarter shot and then your side profile also your statistics your numbers and your measurements okay if they want you they want you if they don't they don't and what you do is you submit to all of them all of them and it's kind of like acting in a sense you have to have a certain list of skills that you're that that you can do right like i speak a different language i'm mixed i'm this tall like people they ask you you speak a different language modeling yes because i can go for commercial work okay so so it's all really intermingled but you go to your go see and hopefully you are able to get seen by somebody that would want to add you onto their board now what happens when you get added onto your board you're normally told you need to go get a portfolio so the agency will take you in and they will pay for it to have professional work done essentially all it does is it gets deducted from your job that you booked and then you end up on on pretty much a shelf now my modeling career didn't go very well in the sense of i was on a board i got picked up by an agency i was scouted super young but because my look wasn't in at that time which is an athletic build and a racially ambiguous person i was in between sizes and considered curvy and urban okay so because i was a curvy urban racially ambiguous model which is all popping now popping now which was not then i couldn't get any work at all um i booked my work because i reached out to people and one of the things that i did was i went to every website of every company i was interested in that i wanted to work with scrolled down to the bottom of the page and it said contact me and i would send out us like a pre-made email with my headshots and my stats and i did it to everyone i also had my own little headshot as a card and it had my headshot with my stats and all my contact information and i would give that out to people in when i would come to la or go anywhere and i would give that out as my business card so hoping that if you ever thought about needing somebody you already had my head shot do you guys need a racially ambiguous curve urban urban hawaiian chinese irish filipino height stats but but i did that and people don't realize like the hustle that went into it like i would take that card everywhere and i did that in college and i got that done myself nobody helped me and when i got signed to an agency i actually booked adidas on my own i did an international campaign on my own because they didn't even submit me because they didn't think i would fit what the client was looking for so i submitted myself showed up they were actually looking for somebody that could run for a certain amount of time that had a size seven and a half foot and my agency didn't realize because that's a standard size for um for when you're going and doing a campaign they have test shoes so they have shoes that are going to be you know eventually put on display but the models need to wear it yeah they didn't even know that i fit the shoe didn't submit me didn't know i was athletic didn't pay attention i went to the go i went to the casting call that i submitted myself to and i booked the job and i was literally the only person that they actually saw that was qualified right then maxim came over like came around and they wanted personality and maxim at that time that's when instagram started to come out so i submitted but then you had to put a video of you speaking my intro video i slid in in superhero underwear and i said hello and i went and did my whole little spiel and that was the only thing that everybody remembered from that season they were like you stood out so i was able to mix the looks which i knew wasn't going to get the job but the personality in with it right so that's how i booked everything because you actually have to have a damn personality as a model would you do playboy if they offered it so i had this conversation with my dad and my mom actually at 19 i had this conversation with my parents um and it was probably at this age now if the money was right yeah and it was what it used to be if playboy used to be as like this huge thing it was like oh my god oh my god naomi barrymore yeah oh yes if you know but if it was playboy in its heyday of like damn you are the baddest [ __ ] walking the [ __ ] earth if you were in playboy then a thousand percent yes yeah but for what playboy is now why so don't do hustler now you know shout out to all my friends that did show magazine all my friends and to the to the people that tried to get me to do show i love y'all um uh i wouldn't mad magazine if i would have had more ass look jesus and the doctors didn't give me ass for a reason because i wouldn't know how to act who does magazines anymore uh that was the only way before instagram came out yeah you were if you didn't have and to this day if you don't got a magazine like watch yourself like watch your tone when you speak to somebody if you ain't never had a billboard if you ain't never walked in a runway show you ain't never had a campaign you ain't never been in a magazine like understand your lane which is everybody's lane is cool damn but there's a lot of disrespect there's a lot of disrespect from people who have never been i mean that's what it used to be right you had to get a campaign i've i've had billboards i did magazines at the international okay so would you do playboy today no i mean they don't even show anything so i guess yes okay so check this out right because playboy ain't what it used to be i haven't looked but i know they're like online now it's like yeah i know yeah it's okay playboy isn't what it used to be playboy in his day when when hillary banks got offered to do playboy yeah so big bag but also uh coochie but not spread open coochie would you be doing it yes oh my god you were like the epitome of the most uh i love how i look without clothes on and i think that is beautiful i thought playboy did a really great job of showing diversity also they did that [ __ ] way before sports illustrated attempted to show uh body acceptance and side note why does sports illustrated always pick the worst pictures of these girls is that what it is yeah i don't know what it is i think they try to show that they're real but you're not picking a lot of real looking women interesting but playboy is glorified right like it's the epitome of femininity playboy was like yo oh my god this celebrity did play boy and it was also considered like the classy one right because it wasn't spread eagle [ __ ] it wasn't if anything it was the top of the coochie with a little bit of hair there's some and then a lot of the bodies were real yeah a lot of the bodies were natural and just the way that you saw them because i remember looking at playboy and i've seen a lot i've seen hustler and i grew up looking at magazines and whatnot and i was like that's too much but there was they're just so pretty in the glow and the way that it shot and as somebody that's a model like you dream of having that photo shoot and i definitely tried to replicate that as much as possible i did the you know like the implied and the wet and the artistic but playboy was always a conversation to most models yeah i think one of the first shoots i saw of you was um maryland's hang matter of fact and it was an implied nudity it was like it was so nakedness on a couch with a uh i don't i forgot what was it with my flower in her butt the flower in her butt no the cactus it was it the cat it was it was basically i was making that yeah you're naughty [ __ ] yeah and i i've his was crazy right it's i've known matter of fact marilyn yeah um so dope since way back like we were um she was from long beach as well we did that shoot in long beach she shot one of my first ever like real like photo shoots you know what i'm saying because uh she she did some type of photo shoot uh she was doing her thing right and um we're from long beach and i i had a video back in the day called dick slang where i was um laughing at a dance called the dick slang and then she did some [ __ ] called the tit slang and then we started talking and she she did some like some some some photo shoots for me and then um so i've known her for a minute that might have been how i found man i don't even know how i started talking to you i don't even know but but marilyn is crazy because she did one of our first goodie photo shoots the first one yes and she was like hey man when this photo shoot was with liam v and um and marilyn was like yo i'm not gonna charge you if you could just get me to 10 000 followers that would be that would be great and um this is like early beginnings of [ __ ] right and i was like easy i got her 10 000 followers and then like all of a sudden like next season she was like [ __ ] um um what's his name skrillex is like maine photographer mentor with him she's one of the first photographers that i i mean there's a lot of photographers that at the time when everybody was popping into instagram and the models were transitioning and realized like there's real [ __ ] money in this instagram stuff and a lot of these girls if you stuck in the traditional [ __ ] you was gonna get left behind so you would dab she came out with such dope work and one of the one of the shots that one of the first shots that did the best for me with her was actually um i was in the couch and my legs and my waist were out of the couch like you didn't even see my face i remember that that one went viral and it was uh my underwear was around my ankles but you couldn't see me so it was a side silhouette and the way that it was shot was just so crazy it was crazy it was dirty it was just oh i loved it and then we did the supreme cactus so the uh she did a lot of body like body shots and so it was um i wasn't wearing any i wasn't wearing anything and and the cactus was just covering me that was it as everybody pauses to google pause did she draw inspiration was it like oh you're prickly [Laughter] no that wasn't it [Laughter] no i was not i mean go look up the images that was a conversation with my parents they were like so you just gonna be the rule with my parents is uh no don't show your vagina and avoid nipples as much as possible but everything else is totally okay which again if you model and to the girls and the guys that are out there if you love your parents you will have a real conversation with them my parents accept me they love me i never dealt with the [ __ ] that a lot of models deal with but so marilyn we did a shot i was spread like this and then i had the cactus and then another one we were in the middle of the street in long beach and i'm shooting uh water into my mouth in a swimsuit in the middle of the road and uh we got told by people in long beach to get the [ __ ] up out of there i don't know if i saw that one yeah but we did a couple marilyn was really she was super dope and it was really nice there was a time when instagram was doing more art artistic shots and you used to have to work with photographers um sydney was one of the models that he said yeah so she's super dope and we've worked with a lot of the same photographers and there's a whole group of girls that did very similar things during that period of time but nowadays it's different yo take [ __ ] pictures there's scouts everywhere post up your headshots be creative you can get picked up on anything but you won't get it just by writing tim or let me ask you this let me ask you this um so aside from playboy okay um what would it take for nikki blades in today's dnas to do a nude photo shoot like full i'm talking about not implied nipples out like bare breasts bear titty photo shoot not spread eagle but yeah artistic with it i mean at this point probably nothing there's there's literally no leverage at this point like i've done implied unless it's the only thing i mean and i'm making hella money off of it but i've done implieds for so long that it's almost like a waste like a nipple being out or being fully naked nowadays it's just like a dime a dozen it like the human like the female body don't hold the same weight it used to like we saw her nipple i just for me there's no but there's no money but there's no money amount right now but that's what i'm saying like there's no money amount there's no playboy there's no accolade there's no movie role there's there's nothing that i could say that like cool that's worth it now if i decide that something fits and i want to have my nipple out because i want to have i want to be naked then yeah but that's because the price isn't what it used to be i think okay do you know what i mean the price isn't what it used to be i think the price would come with with the fact that you've built this audience now yeah through being nikki blades through the no chaser podcast yes the jk news fans loving you if you were to go on an only fans not even only fans just anywhere anywhere but you just anticipation yeah hey i'm going to drop now that they love you so much because it's for it's for me versus like i needed play you people needed playboy back in the day to become established you needed that once in a lifetime oh my god halle berry showing her tits was like the opinion oh and swordfish that was that was like that's the epitome of her career it was like it was like next level [ __ ] like to see some holly berry nibbles yeah and swordfish was like mind-blowing and then to see her get [ __ ] yeah monsters but it did take over but it took over nobody knows anything else she really did or any of her other roles nobody cares yeah that's why would a million dollars be a good number not that i'm not that i'm offering i'm just asking that's what just to just a million dollars of naked photos can it be tax-free um no with taxes so you know like five hundred thousand okay five hundred thousand nipples uh top of the coochie um not spread eagle only top of the coochie would you do it five hundred thousand is it going going to your bank account oh where's the language it's just gonna be on the internet be online people can people google it okay okay okay so it's it's um the reason why i pause is because i've definitely shot [ __ ] for no no money right because i liked it because i was feeling myself so you can throw a dollar amount on it but if like say you catch me on a day that i'm like i'm [ __ ] feeling this and i think i'm beautiful and whatever i might just [ __ ] around and do it because it's not even about the money anymore because the 500 000 let's be real like money is that's it's gone it's gone and like it's quickly doesn't matter that's forever well the images are forever right the money is temporary the images are forever so when you think of it that way that if i just find something that i love and i really want to just embrace myself and i can live with my decision no matter the dollar amount then then yeah the reason the reason i ask that is because i feel like girls like you in your position who have a following who are known for more but still people want to see you naked it's very easy to [Music] charge a dollar yeah and get a million people too you know what i'm saying it it would be like a quick and if it were only fans you could literally charge the lowest amount and make millions because if it gets out there oh she's actually naked on there people are going to come every month especially for that low ass amount so i just always wonder like why girls who are down to be naked don't leverage it in that way um i think about only fans on a daily basis i think about it every day shout out to the girls that are getting all their [ __ ] money and establishing [ __ ] lives off of it you guys are doing really well um for me i think because of where i'm at in my life now if only fans would have came around when i was doing the like maryland the maryland stuff i got a video of me holding like i have a picture of me holding my boobs covering my nipples eating ramen like that [ __ ] to me was just so sexy and i loved being sexy i loved all of that type of stuff but where i'm at now is just not the same feeling feel it i'd have to feel it or else it doesn't feel weird then it feels wrong then it feels like i'm just doing this for like then i'm just doing it for money but i used to do photo shoots because i absolutely was in love with photo shoots and arts and some of the stuff i did with like van styles and i have so many images that i personally love because to me that's what modeling was it was art i got you but but nowadays like i could literally send a [ __ ] foot pick and make all that money if i wanted to catch that if i wanted to catch a bag now say i catch in the swing of things and i'm like cool i want to get back into modeling i don't necessarily know if i would want to do it for only fans i think that i still would want to explore uh different platforms like i still would want a magazine right i still want billboards i still want those things yeah because you come from you know the traditional like kind of aspect of of modeling and being a model right and i understand i still suck it in all the goddamn i'm i'm always thinking of those things um and i and i love it that i think it's really an art form and that's why there's such a difference between an instagram model and who you see in vogue nah i get you i mean it's the same way where i feel like um like how you feel about rap well before we get into that like in the in the sense where i kind of um i get hit up to do a lot of hosty things you feel me and um because i know like like i'm good at it you know i'm saying like i'm good at reading off a prompter i'm good at hosting [ __ ] but like at the end of the day i really want to do scripted content i want to be an actor you know what i'm saying i don't want to be pigeonholed into being a [ __ ] like ryan seacrest mario lopez situation yeah right and shout out to them they're killing it they're probably right they're making so much that's their that's their job that's their [ __ ] that's and that's kind of what they get hit up for right i want to act you feel me yeah and it's like where the like i've turned down uh game show [ __ ] i've turned down like reality show [ __ ] because i don't want that stigma to be held over my like career because that [ __ ] sticks yeah it does stick you know and and and and i don't want to do that i want to act and um so i get where you're coming from yeah i'm saying where you kind of hold this uh this like this aura of like modeling i like the real my the quote unquote real modeling [ __ ] to be a thing you know and i get that yeah i got into radio of all things of all realms of entertainment that i could have gotten into i went from modeling in maxim and being in a swimsuit on a daily basis to being able to speak from like in a market for in san francisco and i did that to prove a point because i eventually realized that modeling only goes so far and if i can turn myself into the brand then i can go further say something happens to my face say i put on weight say i have a baby say i don't live in l.a like san francisco shut down all of its all of its fashion industry and i did that when i moved out to the bay so i've seen what happens in these times and i went because i appreciate it so much and realized maybe i'm not going to be in it the way that i used to think of it then i'ma develop another skill so i went from being the face to being a voice and now finding the hybrid of it which is what i think is beautiful about this here because everybody in this room does multiple things and make and it may not be the thing that they're known for like what you're known for isn't why you're sitting here right now you've added to that because you have so much value like yeah you do this you do this but damn i really want to get to know them cool and then that's why we're all in this space that's that's interesting because i think everybody has a little bit of that like what you guys are talking about you don't want to take these roles because you want to be this you want to be this and i have that for different [ __ ] but in the entertainment i'm like man y'all trippin because like okay i look at flo rida and pitbull all right flo rida and pitbull can rap both of them people [ __ ] [ __ ] rappers wrap around people wouldn't know that but that wouldn't make money right right so they turned into mr [ __ ] right round because and they're bawling and it's like okay this is what i'm gonna do that's more of me with the entertainment [ __ ] but anything that worked both them there's other things where it's like okay let's take the clothing line yeah i know we could just flip what another brand is doing charge a little less and be out of here right we we have the same people who used to make the fear of god [ __ ] like literally you know what i'm saying yeah we could knock off all of [ __ ] jerry lorenzo [ __ ] charge a little bit less and get crazy money but for me it's like no i don't want to do that yeah we trying to be innovative you know what i'm saying yeah i want to be like the sacrifice is worse what kind of shirt do you think you know i'm saying like i want everything we wear i want us to be okay with it you know what i'm saying [ __ ] like that but yeah when it comes to entertainment i'm like man but everything that should be you know you know what i mean but everybody has their own their their own thing like it's really interesting to see because there was a point in time where there were certain jobs for modeling i refused to do i was like i cannot be in another damn music video like i can't be in a music video i can't do this i'm uh you know i i did music videos but i had which ones i did well the original collard green video actually shot that never came out i did that i was in a few other ones i was in like tyga's video background which one but i never thrill in manila nikki blaze is gonna be uh lipsticking august regal's part and it's not fair we got the music video we shooting real soon yeah it's not fair look for that on itunes and all that it's out right now and it's so funny because tim was like can you lip sync i said have you ever seen my instagram like i'm singing all the time i swipe through yeah you do you're like you like man i don't care about her but i'ma hire her from a video though but there was a there was a big point in time where i had to shift away from the urban and that's such a is so bad that they use it the way they use it but the urban um stereotype which means they only looked at me a type of way which means i wasn't going to be able to do any fashion stuff because they were like you have like honestly they were like your boobs are too big they flat out like for the high fashion for the high fashion they were like the hot you can only do swimwear right now you can only do this and then you kind of look at yourself that way too i was like damn i guess i only can and then you realize oh [ __ ] i forgot why i was even here in the first place and it had nothing to do with what i looked like yeah cause they only want me to do like fitness stuff and they're like i'm more than 10 like rick i need you to like keep your shirt on why do you keep getting naked in front of the camera every time we bring it out that's so weird but i want to circle back to something because you brought up a point that actually answers the questions about why that dude hit you up um when you talked about the photographer okay and her saying don't pay me just get me to ten thousand followers okay and you did yeah that's why because that's what people see they see that type of [ __ ] and everybody has this i could do that attitude nobody wants to look at the work like what you all the stuff you were saying about the modeling and stuff none of that [ __ ] people believe probably it's like no you look good yeah you go and look good and they pick you oh they didn't pick me because i don't know this person i don't know that person they never realized i didn't put enough work yeah that's what i'm saying people see you they see me like back when i was actually doing the youtube [ __ ] yeah yeah all the time that was the thing you guys they think of me putting you on right but it's like yes tim had a big following i did something with him his following came to me but why did they stay exactly you know what i'm saying of course people they don't get that far they just feel like okay if this person gives me a shout out i'm gonna get what that person got you know and it don't work like that we've done countless videos with countless girls that did great views and then nothing came of those girls cause those girls didn't have talent at all then there were other girls who were funny or they had some other talent or their instagram was naked you know saying and that's that's a talent too yeah keeping up with your body posting that [ __ ] all of that and they got the following and people stayed and they keep keeping up with them and that's the [ __ ] people do not want to realize i think it's more so oh put me on i got called the biggest clout chaser because i was on here i was like the [ __ ] you think i got in this position how do you think i got here and stayed here for this long like it it is insane because like you said they won't believe it i had emails and emails that were pre-made i have cards that were pre-made like you know everybody had their thing that they did that nobody understood why they were doing it like anybody who's in the position they are in today there were people in the background going damn i hope you make it because you put a whole lot of effort into this if it doesn't go anywhere but like you said they only see the surface that's the thing too it's like yeah i work with marilyn because i thought she was dope yeah and these kids they don't see that right they see that like all i need is somebody with clout as he said yeah to put me on but it's like and i and i i told him i was like do you have any type of videos of you acting do you have a real minimum do you have [ __ ] videos of you in a high school play do you have a reason why i should even feel like you are good at acting for me to want to put you on and like do you have anything and he had nothing for me i'm like dawg what it's the entitlement yes it's the you got into that position how'd you get there i deserve it give it to me bro they really feel like it's just that easy and it sucks so much more for girls because when they call you a clout chaser it's like wait what are you doing you know what i'm saying like what are you doing that makes them feel like you're just here to get clout but the thing is when there's an attractive girl in the vicinity of a popular dude they automatically think something more than what you see is going on and they put that on her oh she's only [ __ ] with him and that's and and that's why i always and why do you and that's why radio was so important and that's why it was so important to me to stick with it in an industry that is uh semi-dying to some people it's dying in a sense to some and i'm young in the game in in radio and i wanted to get into that to prove a point and i proved it like i sh i can sit here with you and tim actually reached out to me because of radio yeah it was i'm not his most popular friend or his most attractive friend or like not at all and there's a bunch of different girls that could be sitting in this spot that would probably get way more views but there's a difference ah they would have been whacked though damn right but but but but the work ethic behind it and why being in radio and then when people say [ __ ] like that i just laugh i said sir do you know i have a 401k i wake up four a.m every morning to work with professionals and i have health insurance don't talk to me about where i actually got big titties damn right i do want to hide them because i can't [ __ ] and if i wanted to show them off i could and you would love it and you would pay for my feet pics but it's so interesting because you can say all that [ __ ] they're not going to care no but it's so you gotta know it if you guys look at the last episode right there's a point where tim leaps he goes to pee right away nikki picks up the conversation yes right away and i trust y'all to do that you know what i'm saying and it's like if it was just a oh she got titties we got a user for a thumbnail that type of [ __ ] wouldn't happen no you know what i'm saying i could've had something look look i you know look we've been doing this [ __ ] for a long time the youtube channel for a long time and and we've we've played the whole game of let's put a pretty girl in the thumbnail sexy [ __ ] to get views we've done that right this is a podcast yeah where people are listening and when i hit up blades specifically not only did i you know have like we were cool beforehand but i knew that like yes i needed a pretty girl to have a female perspective but also i needed somebody who keep up with the conversation yeah and [ __ ] don't ever shut up you already knew i was gonna kick everybody out hi this is no chaser podcast with me myself and i like you look there's there's a look a pretty face is a diamond doesn't you know what i'm saying obviously but look but look i if i wanted just a pretty face i would just have me on this [ __ ] but i want it not hands down not hands watch the last episode a female perspective that could keep up with me and rick and that's why i hit up nikki blades okay and we out here and you guys enjoy it and i'm glad you guys are here and thank you for watching the no change podcast make sure you like comment share subscribe i'll check out the wrong suit i'm ricky and you already know my damn name piss [ __ ]

i have with me is some snoop stream this is Blue Dream and Master Kush crossed leaning more on the indica sides this is going to be more of like a body high and this one is from collective awakenings and beautiful but beautiful beautiful blood oh it's just really really like a lime green color with bright orange hairs it's got a super like sweet piney berry smell to it and I love it even the container still reeks this one is 22 percent THC with 1.93 percent CBD okay CBD is a lot of the medical aspects of marijuana if you don't know what CBD is I highly recommend you pause this video go google it do some research on it and then come back to this video and continue this review I don't really have a whole lot of time to explain a CBD but it is like a lot of the medical aspects it's more of like the body high and stuff like that so the fact that this has a little bit of CBD in it is they're actually really good because a lot of strains out there don't have any CBD in it they're the ones that usually have some CBD usually have very low THC so the fact that this is 22% TAC with almost 2% CBD it's actually fairly good believe it or not so go ahead and give a piece here and I'm gonna go out take this little nutty right here let me break this guy open don't do that even even better wow that's just you know those like fully developed adult like trichomes that are like deep and they just glisten even then we even need light you know you don't have to shine no light on you can just see it that's the kind of trikes that are on this and it's just amazing it shines it's beautiful it's dense so I mean it is super dense but it's not that heavy dense you know what I mean it's not where it's gonna really break you on the scale it's like fluffy dense like the nug is really compact but it's not super heavy which is really good that's actually how I prefer my my bud personally for me I like it where it's that's compact and you know nice solid nug but it doesn't weigh super much so you can get a good amount of it on the scale but that's just me everybody's preferences are different start up the torch up Wow you get that solid taste through throwing through it's got a nice berry taste in the beginning with a nice sweet after tone and I love that sweet after Tony sticks with it like it still tasted in my mouth yeah that's got a nice a nice heart to it I can feel it in my back for someone like me who has fibromyalgia I mean that really feels great it's got a nice hi to it this is a big that I would recommend for chronic pain of stress depression insomnia I mean even appetite probably just it's got that indica in it so I would imagine here in a little bit I'm probably going to have the munchies and want to go get something to eat Wow that was good but no it's really good I really enjoyed that and we got this from collective awakening sandy Boulevard in Portland Oregon great dispensary they got a nice selection of top-quality but highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already all right my rating on the snoop stream right here is that easy 4 out of 5 stars easily almost 5 like pretty much almost for 1/2 if it was a little more potent I would be definitely 5 hands down but I mean a nice about four or four and a half is where I'm gonna put it at and it's I'm gonna say four and a half I'm gonna put it that way just because I mean the taste is great the highest potent and if what puts it over that little half I mean the nuns are are dense and just nice structure and everything to them and what puts it over in that half is the fact that it's got that little bit of CBD in there that's what's gonna give me the half four so four and a half stars if you guys this is something to go check out okay if you know uh Mick DANC rating system this is something to definitely go check out okay it's definitely worth whatever gas to go drive and go get some where from wherever you're at go check out collective awakening snoop dream it's really good strain and I'll be definitely revisiting collective awakenings again and getting some more all right I also like how they gave me like a point over a gram so they're like make sure this is a gram I like that there's this little add-on alright so go check out snoops dream it is blue dream and Master Kush hybrid and it is a really good strain if you like something that's sweet and fruity that's the strain check out and really really recommend it four and a half stars from collective awakenings in Portland Oregon alright guys Andy with macdanne cannabis review please

van wives and this is our tiny home on wheels that we've been living in for over two years we've recently just renovated and we're ready to show you our tiny home on wheels but first let's roll the intro we're jazz and crystal this is bella and izzy this is our van that we have been working living and traveling in full time for over two years our dream is to drive around the world for this reason we live tiny but travel far our van is taking us to some beautiful countries since returning home to canada and with our knowledge of life on the road we've made some major changes to our van we're so excited to show you our new home come on in but before you do subscribe to our channel because we post videos every sunday at 9 30 a.m est are you ready [Music] welcome to the cockpit where we spend a lot of our time as we are driving this van around the world this is a 2006 sprinter van we went with the 06 model as it's a two one end and they actually won an award this year so they have great engines and you're able to fix it and do it yourself which we love doing we bought our van with 155 000 miles on it and we now have 210 000 miles i'd say it gets a good drive we keep a controller for all of our lights in the back right at the front because we tend to somehow always forget to turn the lights off and now no one has to get up as well as crystal's 12-volt diffuser keeps it smelling nice we have a backup camera which is amazing especially because this is a 158 wheelbase sprinter van and high roof which means we are 23 feet long so it comes in handy when backing into those spots because that's really the only way we fit in a lot of parking spots let me introduce you to our two fluffy companions and most importantly the best co-pilot you could ever have izzy and bella this is their favorite spot as they know as soon as they jump out they are going to be at a new backyard with new smells and new friends welcome to the facilities believe it or not we have a fully functioning indoor bathroom on board we have a composting toilet and a hot water shower it is fueled by our 2.5 gallon water tank that means that we both can have a shower which is awesome this is something that we just added to our van and it's been a game changer on the road as prior to this we didn't have a shower or a toilet at all it's like we added a second room it is it's yeah it's great it is a second room really not only is this a shower it also acts as a wet room i'm going to talk to you about some of the features that we added to make it very multi-purpose while on the road first off we have a light that's dimmable which is really great at night time if you got to scoot to bathroom we have hooks on the walls to hang all of our winter gear when it becomes wet after going snowboarding or being out for a good hike we can hang our wetsuits after surfing and it just or even our dish towels actually after doing the dishes it's that simple and it's just a nice place to put anything that needs to dry and it's not in your way it's not hanging around the house so i love that we also added a bam boutique mat which keeps your feet dry after you shower if you've got to use the restroom and it aesthetically looks really beautiful in this white space as you can see i have a ton of space in here i have about half a foot never a head or a head you have a face i have space in here which is really nice that means that we can shower around the toilet if we need to or you can remove it if you need that extra space something absolutely essential to a van life shower is an on and off button on your shower head that way when you're getting clean you can turn the water off to conserve and then you can turn it back on when you need it that way you don't run through your water supply because it is not endless when you live in a van to get into the specs of our airhead toilet it is a composting toilet it can solve number one or two and it does that by diverting the solids and the liquids so it has a liquid jug and a solids bucket and what we do is we put peat moss or coconut core inside of the bucket and after you use the number two you turn the spindle and it composts it and makes it easier to take care of when you have to and if you're wondering if it smells it doesn't but to keep it clean we have half and half vinegar and water we spray it in the toilet after every use and a little bit of palo santo to keep it smelling fresh and to wrap up why i love this space so much just check out this privacy bye a little see-through gotta love it this area might not look like a whole lot but it is honestly a lifesaver so up here we store all of our bedding which is honestly wasted space if you don't end up using it it's just the headliner so we custom built this shelf with some brackets threw it up and now our bedding doesn't bug us and right beside our shower we created a little mini closet and this stores so many things that you often forget about when you're building a van so we have extra toilet paper in here a whole spot for laundry our shoes and even a nice little bookshelf at the top and a 120 receptacle to power our hot water heater this is my favorite spot in our home we have a two burner propane cooktop we love cooking on fire and that's why we went with propane we have an 11 pound propane tank that fuels this the best part about having the stove here is that it's so close to the door when the door is open you're practically cooking outside and we've got a window here for the view you just can't beat it an upgrade that i'm really stoked about and i'm so happy jasmine talked me into it was getting an rv water tank it's fixed in our van that means that we don't have to remove jugs in and out like we used to it's 42 gallons so that fuels our shower we do our dishes with it and it's our drinking water we went with this size because we also have two dogs and they drink a lot of water and let me tell you they don't pull their weight if you're wondering where we store all of that water the tank is fixed into the bottom of this structure and alongside that is our 12 volt water pump which tees off to feed our shower and our faucet as well as all of our plumbing we went in with black fixtures because we think they look real nice uh the pull-down faucet is really good for cleaning the sink and we also go with compostable sponges that way we're not constantly going through them these maintain their structure for a long time and there's no plastic it's coconut yeah it's coconut if you watch our vlogs and you've been along for our van build series you'll know it took us 12 hours to build one drawer but that being said we have drawers and they're amazing it really feels like a home in this drawer we have all of our spices and our cutlery beneath it we have all of our pots and pans cutting boards and a strainer and over here we have a cute little drawer that we built customized to fit around our sink that holds our toothbrushes and everything that we use in the morning and the nighttime all of our hygienic products and in our third drawer we have melamine dishware in the van it looks glass but you could drop it on the floor and it's not gonna break so we've built this short in a u-shape to fit around our sink as well and it actually fits everything just perfectly above the kitchen we have our overhead cabinet with two leds which lights up the kitchen and this sink also acts as our bathroom sink so having this here is extra storage for our towels vitamins makeup bag which is awesome to have right here when you need it we wanted to make our kitchen even bigger so we actually added an extendable counter so this is just on folding brackets and it can come in and out that way it's not disturbing your door space because keeping this open is actually amazing it just makes the home feel that much bigger and brighter but we still have that extra counter space so we can dry dishes on here or we can do the chopping it's really good for team cooking as well as we actually had a professional wood maker make us these counters because it really is the biggest thing you see in the van and you want it to be pristine he did a great job it's an oak two-inch countertop and he used black epoxy to fill in and i'd say compliments the house amazing and we were even more obsessed with making the kitchen even bigger so if you come this way we doubled our kitchen with this area we used to have a floor-to-ceiling pantry and we demolished that and made a much smaller pantry but gained so much extra counter space and actually a lot of room so up here we have another overhead cabinet which actually lines the entire van which is great for full-time fan life but we kept this one open as it is in the kitchen area so up here we have everything that we use a lot like hem parts chia seeds cashews my favorite food as well as couple um what are they called recipes recipe books you can clearly see i don't follow those and anything that we use all the time makes it easy then of course we have a nice little fruit basket which we love beautiful garden and on this wall we have a nice charging port for our phones our victron and of course another dimmer that does all of these four led lights along the ceiling and if we open up these doors this is our dry pantry cans pastas you name it as well as our coffee and tea essentials are kept in here we love a good coffee we even weigh it at the bottom is our blender dog food and of course a huge bag of potatoes and i bet you can't guess what's in this box but it is our fridge so if we lift this up it's on gas struts as well keeps it up so it doesn't go down in your hands because it is a very heavy countertop but we have a dometic cfx 50 which keeps probably i'd say a good three weeks of food we also went with the chest style as we normally are traveling in very hot climates and when you open this all the cold air stays in instead of escaping out which then makes your system work even harder we did vent it so don't worry it won't overheat we learned that lesson we built this structure up high that way the fridge would be at hand's reach we don't like bending down 24 7. we are full time in this van so it's very convenient to have it right here and at the bottom we have two little doors and that keeps all of our gear which makes these youtube videos an instagram post and all that jazz oh yeah i love that as my bedtime table oh yeah this is a great area for your bedtime table keeps the water nice and close for crystal as you can see our van is light bright and airy and we've actually wrapped shiplap all the way around from the ceiling to the walls and it just made the van so much brighter the light comes in the windows and it bounces off the walls and it keeps it feeling really spacious and that brings me to our windows we actually installed one i don't know how many installed installed so many but we actually installed five windows in our van this is super important for when we're filming we actually lived in the van for a year before youtube and since we used to have a dark rustic van we very quickly learned that it was not enough light to be filming videos and so now no matter where we are in the van it feels really big and you can see everything you can see a beautiful face and to keep the theme we went with melamine cupboard doors they're easy to clean they're held on by gas struts gas struts keep these doors closed while we're driving that way our clothing stays folded not that they ever really yeah they do and it keeps the doors open that way while you're getting things out it's not a problem and might i mention that all four of these are full of clothing in this overhead cupboard we have our sweaters pants shirts and t-shirts underwear and socks we have a shared wardrobe which definitely makes van life way easier but we also live in the van through all four seasons meaning that we have a little bit of winter clothing in here summer clothing but other than that it's pretty minimalistic for a wardrobe i would say i think so and something a little too canadian is there is a hockey stick hiding in here right now i'm sitting on top of the proudest moment of our diy van build as well as my favorite aspect to our van which is our beast of an electrical system gotta get yourself a human that looks at you like jazz looks at our electrical system after lots of research and a lot of diagrams drawn we decided to tackle our electrical system on our own this is the second system we have installed however this system is huge compared to our last it is quite intimidating but there are so many resources out there and if you have the time and you have the confidence to do your own electrical system i highly recommend you do as things can go wrong all the time and it's great to have that knowledge and know everything how it's wired and and make sure you have a diagram my diagram is just literally glued up in my head i will tell you every size of wire so let's get into the specs we partner with battleborn for this entire system and they truly set us up we have 400 amp hours of lithium battery which is amazing as they can drop down to 20 and yes they do good in the cold as they are battleborn we have three ways to charge our system the first way and our favorite way is with the sun so we have 300 watts of solar on the roof which then feed into an mppt charge controller number two is with our 2000 watt inverter we also have a charger on that which is a very quick charge if you have shore power and the last way to charge our batteries is through the alternator that way when we're driving our car battery is actually charging our house batteries which is really good in van life especially when you're in north america as you don't get that much sun it gets dark at like 4pm here folks however it is a smart isolator which doesn't affect our batteries back here or up there so we have ac and dc most people are used to ac as it's your average household plug this allows us to plug in our water heater our blender phone camera drone anything that has that prong and on the dc side we have a blue sea fuse box and bus bar which pretty much powers our entire house from our fans our toilet our water pump our heater even our cell phones as charging dc takes a lot less electricity and one of my favorite parts of our electrical system is our jackery thank you zachary for sponsoring this van tour without a doubt jackery has become a part of our home there's not a day that goes by that we don't use our portable power station behind me we're using the jackery explorer 1000 and we use it as a side kick to our house electrical system meaning that through the winter months or on cloudy days we'll take a load off our system by using the jackery the jackery has a 1000 watt puresign inverter with three ac outlets on the face with two usba usbc and a 12 volt auxiliary outlet the jackery powers all of our gear to make these weekly videos from our gopro to our drone to our camera batteries to our laptop and more in the morning it mixes toast and smoothies in the blender it's incredible to have in the van but what's even better is how it keeps you powered outdoors for example you could be on an off-grid family camping trip for the weekend post it up for an afternoon picnic or simply just lounging on the beach and jackery has got you covered with a reliable lightweight convenient source of power and since you're going to be using the jackery so much it's really important to know how to recharge it there's a few ways to do this the first being using a regular household plug 120 volt the second is 12 volt we do this while we drive and when we get to our destination we don't have to think about it and we've got power the third and best way and greenest way is using the sun's rays you can use the easy to connect jackery 100 watt solar panels and voila you're charged depending on your needs you can explore and compare all of the models to see what works best for you and this brings me to some very exciting news jackery day is coming up on march 17th they are hosting an online conference to launch a whole bunch of new products with more wattage and more powerful than ever before so click the link in the description and stay tuned to see what's in store welcome to our dining area and our bed and our studio this is a multi-purpose area not only where we dine for breakfast lunch and dinner but we do a lot of work here online we also sleep in this area and we'll get to that later so we have a huge table that way we can both have some food out as well elbow space apple space very important laptops however comfortable doing some work let's be real izzy's bad and she's looking at the window how cute is that all right so these benches are not just for sitting they are storage and a lot of storage in this one that i'm sitting on we have all of our outdoor gear all of our fun stuff the stuff that makes van life that what it's all about really because it's not about being in the band it's about being outside so we've got like our surf gear we have our camping gear you know in the winter we have our snowshoes in the summer we've got everything really what else do we have in here i don't even know so much stuff and the bench izzy and i are sitting on is actually six feet long so half of it belongs to the electrical system like i just talked about however the other half is all of our tools so we carry everything from a drill a driver a jigsaw a multi-tool it's really important to top up on your fluids make sure you have extra oil if you have extra transmission oil or carb cleaner that helps us clean our heater and honestly maybe a quarter of this bench under here is car parts we like to carry extra spare parts as you never know when you're gonna break down a lot of times we have broken down at the most incredible beaches however we have no cell service so it's nice to have that belt that you can throw on if yours is a snap down those roads [Music] these are the sleeping quarters we have the comfiest bed and i might be biased but we both get great night sleep every night we sleep vertically in the van and the dogs have just enough space for themselves as well so we can snuggle up in the morning the best part about this area is that we have windows surrounding us and we wake up we open our eyes we can crack it get some fresh air we can see the trees outside and see what the weather's like it's honestly the best and what makes it so amazing having the windows here is that when you do open them and you've got the max air fans on it brings the air in and it keeps things flowing that way it's never stale or dry in here the mattress that we sleep on is actually six inch firm memory foam that we've cut ourselves to shape using a turkey knife and they customized to the shape of our van and our benches and the reason that we chose to make our bed every morning and every day and go with the bed bench style in our conversion is because we wanted to have the ability to use the back doors anytime so we have them open usually all day long when the weather's warm or when we're in a warmer climate like when we're traveling down to mexico the doors are open and the dogs can run all the way through the van go outside and do laps if they wanted to they also have the floor space this is something that we wanted to include in our build so they could be comfortable at all times and that's another pointer to the windows we wanted them to be able to see outside see the squirrels or whatever else is going on out there [Music] our beautiful table also matches all of our counters and we actually made it a homemade lagoon table so when you want to walk through this actually swivels you just put it to the side and that way you can go through makes it really nice for life on the road as well as we don't always have it up so all you have to do is spin it off we normally just store this at the front if we're not using it when we're sleeping it goes under the bed so we actually just made it out of plumber's piping simple design with a couple elbows phalanges and some straight poles before we sneak out of the house we just want to tell you about how we heat our home we have a 12 volt sbar d2 heater which we bought used and installed all on our own we dropped our diesel tank and we installed it through an auxiliary line and it keeps us warm no matter what the climate it's honestly amazing and it makes winter van life actually happen we have a thermostat that keeps it running even when it drops below it'll kick back on and that way we don't have to think about it at all it truly feels like a tiny home on wheels yeah keeps our water pipes from freezing oh yeah forget it not just about us what about our water all the things in here that need to remain a certain temperature to keep this home running welcome to our front stoop right here we actually extended the floor just to give us a little bit extra floor space it's really nice if you just want to lounge at the side door the dogs can sprawl out as well as it hides all of our plumbing and it just looks like we really finished it off at the side step during our rebuild we decided to do some bodywork we actually added this beautiful black skirt on our nice white van and this is called rock guard because we go on so many bumpy roads there's rocks thrown up and everything it's a really thick paint that way if anything chips rust won't start so it protects your vehicle and it looks pretty nice i have to say we decided to beef up our tires and go with the bfgoodridge ko2's the baja ones a few things on the outside of our van that stand out especially if you're looking at that roof is we have two max air fans which create a very nice airflow throughout the entire van as well as the wii boost black antenna up there which is the drive reach which can actually give us 5g signal and that's really good for us when we are off grid as we always are as we still do like to work online but off grid if that makes sense as well as we added two outdoor led lights that way we can flick them on see everything around us make sure it's all safe for the girls to go out and have an outdoor party we have that customizable license light so if you see us on the road make sure you say hello and we'll give you some stickers thank you all for joining us on our van tour we hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions about our build let us know in the comments we love talking van build or if you're building a van as well as check out our old van tour and let us know what you think of our upgrades i think and maybe our carpentry skills i think they've increased just a little bit they've improved okay we'll see you next sunday and you're just like ciao out of my house everyone i want to be quick just wait five more minutes we've laughed we walked the whole thing [Music]", "0wZpheK98Gc": "[Music] they smug and scare my name tried to raise a favor [Music] don't you what you feel [Music] it's what [Music] so when you see [Music] [Music] third grade I'm in the hallway and I'm sure I shouldn't have been and Cory white comes up to me and asks yo have you heard the new Missy Elliott track I reply who is Missy Elliott at the time my parents only let me listen to gospel and the smooth jazz station but that day I went home ran upstairs to my room and closed the door which is a cardinal sin in a black mother's house and I waited on giro to come home and then it happened metallic sand a black trash bag filled my TV screen and I hear the coolest thing I'd ever heard and hey he is a living beat me who got the keys to the Jeep prom and at that moment I had my entire life figured out I was going to grow up to be Missy Elliott I spent the next 10 years of my life recording every winding videos to learn dance moves passing that Dutch getting my freak on and trying to figure out what the hell she was saying and working there was so many artists I could have idealized at the time but Missy was the only one who looked like me it is because of Melissa Elliott that I believe that a fat black girl from Chicago could dance until she felt pretty could be sexy and cool could be a woman playing a man's game and not be apologetic about it if you asked me for representation and the media is important I will show you my velour outfit in the matching can't go ahead I begged my parents for I will show you a woman who learned how to dance until she felt pretty feminism Western crow factor C bamboo earrings had a bass beat for the gods feminism it's a brat Missy Elliott Lord Kim won the night tonight track feminism so that's a woman in my arena you are not my competition as a woman in my arena your life doesn't make mine any dimmer dear Missy I did not grow up to be you but I did grow up to be me and to be in love with who this woman is to be a woman playing a man's game and to not be apologetic about any of it asked me what representation is important I will tell you one days I don't feel pretty I hear the sweet voice of Missy singing to me pop that pop that jiggle that fat and don't stop getting to your clothes get wet I will tell you that right now there million girls just waiting to see someone who looks like them [Applause] Wow give it up for Ashley Hayes again she's incredible god damn that is so crazy need to catch my breath in seconds [Laughter]

Growers and welcome back\nto the most List Cannabis Growing Channel! \u00a0Now today I am going to be doing a little\nbit of curing as well as a smoke review video for you guys as I recently harvested the Limoncello\nHaze plants from that mother plant and cloning grow series. So the results were top-notch and it looks\nlike we will be getting a little over a pound in terms of the yields. And so in this video what I'm going to be\ndoing is taking the buds down from the drying rack since they just finished that process\nand then I'm going to show you guys the curing process as well as a little smoke review of\nthese Limoncello Haze buds so you guys can get my feedback and review on how they turned\nout. Also don't forget that we have that two-week\nfree trial to our entire Grow video library still going on, so if you want to sign up\nfor that, just visit the link right here on your screen and hit the Subscribe button overlaid\non those videos. Alright Growers so now that you know what\nwe are doing in today's video we are going to head downstairs into the drying room to\ncheck on those Limoncello Haze Buds! So we are out here in the garage where I have\nthe drying tent with the buds hanging up, and this is the tent that I was using to grow\nmy NukeHeads Series in. I have some autoflowers going on in the tent\nthat I had these ones growing and so that's why I'm not drying them in there. But usually I just use the same grow tent\nthat I grew the plants in to hang dry them. So you will see up top we got about 2 full\nrows of solid colas here. And then again this is the Limoncello Haze,\n\u00a0and let me get you guys a good Focus close up on these babies. They are getting really dance, still very\nfrosty and the smell is actually still really good even though they are drying out at this\npoint. But yeah really stoked on the yields here\nand I'm hoping for about a pound from these Limoncello Haze plants. And then down here we have all of the popcorn\nnuggage. and this is actually some really good quality popcorn mug and I will show you\nguys some good quality close-ups once we start getting them in the jars and such. But yeah they are really nice looking and\nit smells really good down here as well. So what I'm going to do now is get them off\nof the hangers and put it right into my trays here, and then I will meet you guys up stairs\nfor the jaring process. Alright so here we are up in the bedroom and\nI've got all of the popcorn bud in this tray right here and then you can see all of the\nmain colas are right here in this one. And you can see now under the light how nice\nand dense and frosty they are. And you can just see they're really good quality\nbud and a very good yield. Now the popcorn buds are looking really good\nas well and you can see a lot of these you see are solid nugs. They have a little purple tint to them as\nwell, but yeah they are not Airy or anything like that, very dense and I would say there\nis a good quarter pound of it right here. Maybe a little bit more. But yeah a lot of good popcorn nugs. And these are actually just really good size\nnugs that weren't on a branch that was easy to hang, so I just clipped them off at that\npoint as you can see. And lots of good size nugs in here. So what I am going to be doing is I'm going\nto jar and weigh these all out. Well actually I'm going to weigh them out\nand then jar them. But what I will be using is the quart-size\nmason jars right here. And then each jar is going to have an 8 gram\n62% Boveda humidity pack in there. And that is just to help with the curing process\nand to make sure that they don't dry out too much, or get too humid in there as I can cause\nmold. And then of course you don't want your buds\noverdried if that's not going to taste well and it's going to smoke really harshly. So let me just give you guys one more good\nlook at the popcorn nugs here as well as these big main colas. Let's see, here is Big Daddy right here, this\nis the biggest one I've harvested, sorry let me get those off of there. But yeah you can see those are really good\nsize cola's and then all the little side ones right there or just massive. This is probably about I mean the bud is probably\nabout 12 in in length I would say maybe a little more including the side colas. And yeah I again with the ones that are still\non the branch all you got to do is Click them off right at the base of the nug into the\njar. And then you are good to go for the curing\nprocess. So let me try these babies up and then I will\ngive you guys that full weight right after that. All right folks so so far I have jarred up\nall of the popcorn nugs and have weighed those out so you can see that right there. I got about four and a half jars worth in\nthem and it is right at around 142 grams. So that is about 20 grams over a 1/4 pound. So that is really good and then you can see\nright here I just finished clipping off all of the colas or all of the buds off of those\nmain colas office main branches. So I've just got those nuggs, full nugs right\nhere ready to go into the jars. \u00a0So I am going to get this weighed out and\njarred, and then I will show you guys what that looks like. But really stoked I mean this is I think I'm\ngoing to go to hit a pound at least with all of this. And let me just show you guys, I mean the\nquality of these popcorn nugs, they are not really popcorn nugs I shouldn't be saying\nthat as they are more just like big mugs that were not on big enough branches to be hung\nup by. But you can see a lot of them are just like\nthis. So I'm very stoked and got about a 142 grams\nor a quarter pound, a little over a quarter pound from the popcorn nugs. And then hopefully three quarters of a pound\nmore from this right here. So let me get these nugs jarred up and then\nI will be back to show you what that looks like. All right guys so I just finished jarring\nup all of those main Cola Buds. And that got us about 5 more jars. So yeah and total after weighing everything\nout you can see the weight of each jar written right there. But it came out to exactly 302 grams so not\nquite a whole pound but it's about three-quarters of a whole pound. So very happy on that yield especially because\nthose clones were only vegged for about 2 weeks. So they didn't have very much time to put\non any size and they are still getting a really good yield per plant. So with that that's about let's see just over\n10 oz. And I had five of those clones plus one mother\nplant. So about 2 oz of plant but the mother plant\nprobably had about three or four. And then I'm going to say the Clones had about\nan ounce and 3/4 to almost to ounces per plant. So pretty good yield per plant, I'm pretty\nhappy about that specially because I said it was only a 2 week veg period. And here are some of those main Cola buds\nright there in the jar just so you guys can see how they look. So what I'm going to do now is put them in\nmy dresser drawer I have an open drawer to keep them in for the curing process. Just because you want them in a cool dark\nplace, and then I am going to be burping them for about 15 minutes each day for the coming\nweeks here and after about probably 4 to 5 days of curing them in the jars. I am going to be back here to show you guys\nand do a little smoke review to test out these Limoncello Haze Buds just to give you guys\nmy feedback and review on how they really came out. So I am going to give these guys some time\nto cure now and then we will be back for that smoke review! Alright guys so Cody is here to help me do\nthe Bud review. So it is time to test out the Limoncello Haze\nNugs. \u00a0I've got two jars up here, one for Cody\nand one for myself. We are going to pop these Lids off and check\nout how they are smelling and just their overall appearance. So these were put into the jars on the 16th\nand it is now the 22nd so almost a full week in the jars of burping. Definitely can tell a big noticeable difference\nin the smell since trimming them and hang drying them. \u00a0What do you think? You can definitely tell too, so when we first\ntrimmed like the very first time, we are very nitpicky about it and I think we trimmed a\nlittle too much. But I think on this one now that we are a\nlittle more experienced we just trimmed the proper amount and when you are done trimming\nit seems like you leave behind too much of you know what supposed to be trimmed off. And then when you get to this stage of curing,\nyou realize it is the perfect amount because those bigger leaves just shrink in and as\nlong as they have some THC on them with those crystals, it will all shrink in together. And form a nice dense bud, and it will actually\nbe denser if you you know don\u2019t over trim it. Yeah exactly, and I can definitely tell that\nthe nuggs have tightened up a decent amount as well since we put them in the jars. \u00a0And I've got some good shots up close there\nfor you guys to check out. Still looking really Frosty, they aren't looking\ntoo dry or too crispy or anything like that but they do have a dense kind of hard feel\nto them. It's kind of like when you go to the dispensary\nand you buy the stuff that is like stupidly expensive and you just look and it's like\na rock. And the stuff that doesn't look like much\nin size and then when you grind it up it really grinds up into a lot of weed. Definitely. So yeah we will probably be hearing these\nfor another week and a half with the daily burp, and then we will go to every other day. And then from there on it's more of just a\nonce-a-week type of situation for long-term burping. But do you want to grind some up and then\nI will give them a little info about where a little background info on the genetics for\nthe Limoncello Haze. So it is actually a sativa dominant hybrid\nof both the lemon skunk and then the super silver haze strains. And it is a two-time Cannabis Cup winner from\ngreenhouse seeds. So greenhouse seeds is a pretty famous seed\nbreeding company as they have some of the best strains out there for sure. Now when it comes to the effects and attributes,\nat the top of the list it has happy and energetic and euphoric. And then at the bottom it has uplifted as\nwell as relaxed. And then for medical purposes it is really\ngreat for relieving stress or helping with depression and fatigue. And then it is also pretty good for pain as\nwell as a lock for appetite. So now to compare so they have some grow info\non this strain, so they say it is actually a moderate strain to grow and difficulty but\nI actually felt it was easy and actually a good strain for beginners to start off with\nif they wanted to. Not a super difficult strain, it does say\nit gets pretty tall, over 78 in in height. But I did a lot of low stress training and\nTopping so I kept it pretty short from what you got a saw in the videos. It says it gets about 1-3 ounces per square\nfoot and I would say those pretty accurate. \u00a0I was growing in a 2 x 4 and I had that\nabout fully filled out and we just go about three-quarters of a pound or a little bit\nover. So pretty close in that regard, and then it\nsays 7 to 9 weeks for flowering. I would say it was about closer to 9 weeks\nfor myself, and then the stretch it says is around 100 to 200% and I definitely noticed\nthat with the Clones because they almost doubled in height during the flowering stage. \u00a0So for the smells it says, so to recap on\nthe growing I would say what they have here is pretty close and pretty accurate to what\nI experienced when growing that strain. Now for the smells it has lemon, Citrus, as\nwell as earthy. So what would you say I mean the smell to\nonce you grind it up compared to when it is still in its nug form is definitely a lot\ndifferent too. Definitely getting the lemony and citrusy\nsmell, but I don't know if I'm getting I don't think I'm really getting any of that earthy\nsent. I definitely notice the earthy with that Grape\nApe strain that we were reviewing the other day, that I was reviewing that with Claire. But this one is definitely like a citrusy\nlemony, and yeah it smells like a really good sativa. Like a Jack Herer or a blue dream, just a\nreally good one. And yeah this is a sativa dominant like I\nwas saying and then let's see if there is anything else about lineage. Yeah the Lemon Skunk which is a hybrid. And then the super silver haze which is a\nsativa, so yeah let's get to the best part of the video which is the actual smoke review. So I will be packing a little snap for myself\nand then Cody can pack one as well just so we can get the full flavor effect. We don't have to smoke the other burnt stuff\nfrom each others bowl. And then we've got Claire's new Stratus Bong\nhere. \u00a0It is called Baby Blue just because of the\nblue colors and it is pretty small to actually. But it works really well goes really good\nhits. So I do get a little bit of that earthy taste\non the exhale, but then there is also afterwards you can definitely tell there is that citrusy\nafter note as well. Immediately feel it with the cerebral affect\npretty strong in the front like my forehead area and then right behind my eyes that is\npretty noticeable. And then honestly my arms just feel really\nrelaxed, almost immediately I just felt them loosen up especially like the backs of my\narms. So definitely feeling the body effects but\nalso pretty strong in the head as well. And just really good sized tight nugs from\nthe plant to which I was really stoked on. Very frosty too, so what would you say? I guess I taste the earthiness more now, but\nstill, okay so now yeah at the end you taste it. But the earthy or the lemon? The earthy. \u00a0It was kind of like At first not really\nbut then at the end it definitely. Just like any good sativa for me you do feel\nit pretty quick like Dylan said in the eyes and the forehead, your eyebrows. I noticed I hold a lot of tension in my forehead\nand my eyebrows and I catch myself holding them higher than normal. It just feels normal to me. So sometimes when I take a good rip of some\ngood weed I can actually feel that relaxation happen and yeah almost immediately too. \u00a0And it's nice because you don't have to\nbe Stone to practice keeping your eyes relaxed. Just sometimes you need that initial help\nto realize I didn't even realize I was holding tension there. Yeah another thing I didn't show you guys\nthere is a bowl or the ash is pretty much all white after hitting it so that's a good\nsign that it was properly flushed. I think that is my favorite thing about home\ngrowing, as you just know it is all really organic and you know you are not getting anything\nsketch. Yeah it is clean and it is a lot of fun to\ndo, and you get to pick out which strains you are going to have so you got your own\nselection choices. You can make extract if you want to, it's\njust all up to you and you don't have to pay the Crazy Prices to do it. \u00a0Yeah I think the Limoncello will definitely\nbe a repeat. Again this is Limoncello Haze by the Amsterdam\nmarijuana seeds, so it is from their genetics lineup and I think this is actually one of\ntheir premiums seed strains. So definitely worth checking out. \u00a0So overall review what would you give it\non a one-to-ten scale. Well for sativas I guess because there's just\na dominant sativa. I would give it a seven and a half or somewhere\nright there. It's really good, it is a delicious sativa,\nI don't really have any negatives about it it's just that I have had better. And you can get more in terms of density of\nTHC. If we are really talking you know but for\nregular smoke this is a great strain I think if you like sativas. Yeah this is my first time having the Limoncello\nHaze actually, and I mean one of my favorite strains is Jack Herer. Very similar in my opinion to this and how\nit grew, and same with the effects. It reminds me of that a lot. So I would say probably like an eighth for\nthis one or an 8.5. Not my favorite sativa ever that I have smoked,\nbut definitely top 5, maybe top three even. So yeah that is our review for the Limoncello\nHaze. \u00a0And again it is a sativa dominant strain\nand it is by Amsterdam marijuana seeds. Alright GreenBox Growers, that concludes the\nkeyring and smoke review video for those Limoncello Haze Buds by Amsterdam marijuana seeds. \u00a0And again those were from the plants that\nI grew with the Mother Plant and Cloning grow series, so if you guys want to check out those\nvideos and how I grew them exactly, just visit greenboxgrown.com \u00a0and under the videos tab\nyou will see it there listed.

We are reviewing Liberty haze blue dot and Irene app Video sharing. Okay, we are back Okay, glad you got manage it. Oh, yeah, me too But one thing I do want to talk about today with the mm Jake's and with surgery and medicine in Any type of medicine, this is only going to take away a small portion of my pain Physical pain is a hard one to get and that's why a lot of people Are a lot of displace on a lot of people get too addicted to it? It's because there's a lot of things that we've tried to take that doesn't work. It doesn't help us and We don't have that relief One of the things that popped into my mind yesterday after I had done surgery and was sitting in recovery was oh my god I completely understand why people are signing these suicide pacts. I get it. This pain is excruciating This pain is just just absolutely I don't like it any of it Um the Surgery, it's or the recovery. Time of the surgery is probably about a week or two. It's not bad They say that you don't need pain management mixing pain medicine after about three or four days of doing this That is also the doctor. They gave me that information. I will give you the information once I'm done So I'm going to kind of do a diary and track all of my symptoms and see where they serve Without puke it's because that's where I'm stuck at and then I'm going to put a diary on how well this is actually helped what? Is my actual percentage of being able to drop my pain? So that's what we're looking at Willy Wonka 4/20. Nice to see you garden Shannon Yes Everybody is you know I really hope to be doing better to read Cora has been had to deal with me screaming and yelling at nurses yesterday And that I did you Because they kept trying to call all of my other doctors Instead of the doctor to get the surgery because it's the doctor. I think the surgery would ever happen So they were going to call all of my other doctors the giant field personally and is being most unprofessional thing that could be done Now you want to call my other doctors and Check and make sure that they haven't given me any other medications. I'm good with that be my guest check it all day long But in my particular case yesterday We didn't check the club. Mannesmann is going to give me time l3. I have been at home full or it's for other symptoms and then he didn't even write to the file until 3:00 because he had a problem getting the Description go through so that's where I'm at now So I'll be calling the doctor again because this is bad my you know, once the gas itself starts to go away So the gas goes win. Hey, are you I'm not going to call them. I'll deal with it But what they do is they punt your abdomens full of this gas and basically that gives them the room to be able to do the Surgery, the one I do is take pictures and all that other stuff So I went ahead and let them do bigger. I had pictures taken yesterday This is what it looks like when it's in your gallbladder or when they have to go in for your gallbladder Which I think is kind of cool that they sent them home with me Trying to keep my name out of here, I'm sorry So it is kind of tools to be able to look back and see what that all looks like and what it looks like in Your body so for that I'm extremely grateful. I love when they do those pictures a Lot of details absolutely you know something one of the biggest things that I like to do is make sure that Everybody knows I'm doing what it is that I I set out to do with this channel. I always Always always always write up my reviews So that is a huge a huge thing for me. My reviews have to be written up in my book. So yes a Detail is very important After your laughter Scott hams told I wouldn't need it any time off The doctor said indeed it I could play tennis if I wanted to right The cast is worse the gasp. Absolutely horrendous so and then I go just earth just Doesn't work doesn't work. Let me tell you the work So as always guys fuck cancer and fuck pain Oh wait too long, so we're going to pick this up So, yeah, no, I'm so happy you guys are here every day with me it just it makes my famous worth it I ex wear One of these that I've discovered is that being at home all day by myself since gets depressing it can get hard to deal with my own the excuse of A next something cannot on a talk to you specifically about it I want to make sure that you're getting outside every day and joint a little bit of that sunshine So that sunshine is very very important to To being able to feel good and to get some of those depression thoughts out of your head So even if it's just to go outside to sweep the patio or just to sit and drink a little bit of coffee. I Want you guys to make it up like every day and enjoy a little bit of that Sun Because that's what your glitz will be all need Just farting help. Lol. I'm just playing. Yeah, they do tell you the part. And yeah Yeah, sometimes it does help but once it gets up into here He get farted anymore. You've gotta wait for it to dissipate or you gotta burp it out, which sucks Yeah Okay, so let's go ahead and jump right into this review no This is Liberty haze blue dot and Eirene app, but guess Shannon O'Brien since caps It's worse the first day the co2 in the afternoon must be absorbed by your tissues the second day It will be much better than the third day. It will be almost gone. Good morning Glad to see you're up and doing okay Thank You, Shannon Actually, I would have to say in my particular case. The pain is worse today with the gas can watch yesterday Purely because The reason why I think that is because they loaded me up with so much pain medicine That even when I got home last night I was uncomfortable But I wasn't like this so and that was just You know from all of the pain I think any because Before I I wasn't even fully awake and they were pumping that stuff into me I guess I was moaning and I was crying in the frickin Recovery room and it wasn't even awake. I wasn't even coherent So I just from the pain so why he chose? To do this. I I don't know But I can't tell you that by the time anybody wanted to talk to him and now I was fully awake He had already left the hospital. He had already left the hospital and gone probably golfing for all I know So, yeah Shannon O'Brien said lying down helps. Yes. I will be lying down right after this review So it is I agree lion Gump does help if you have any over-the-counter Medications like Tylenol or ibuprofen those will help as well It will not take it all the way and that's okay My throat is still really really scratchy from the tubing me yesterday.

I apologize some more Negatives of this are dry eyes and mass that's not too bad, you know These pseudo negative effects I Take a couple of medications on a regular basis that I find absolutely hilarious That the negative effects of it is the same disease that I have So it causes the same thing that I have but it's the treatment How does that work? How can a medication cause what you have? But it's it Please if somebody knows the answer to that let me know. Yes, I get that it doesn't happen a lot of people and I get that it's just gonna bring those symptoms up new people that are Pre exposed to it. However You're prescribing a medication for the disease. I already have that. It's going to cause it So my other question being having been is it gonna make my condition worse? So that's the questions that I want you guys to start thinking of and asking So blue dot on iris gun. I kind of clumped these two together.

Oh Right every now and again, I start getting these cramps that come up through here, and I'm like trying to breathe through it. It sucks You might be in Vegas for a wedding next month, can I look awesome? Ah Hey, that'd be awesome. If you could come out and see me And we could smoke together and talk a little bit because I I would really love to To know that you're feeling better and that things are getting better with you But Magus is a couple of hours away or well a few hours away. You not a couple of a few It's about three and a half hours. I think I've been there awhile and I have to go back to Tucson For treatment so money's been tight so I can't drive there So I'm sorry if but if you're ever ever Around I would really really love to sit down and have a conversation with you You've had a lot of interesting and cool ideas on here And I just I don't know you're part of my family Now you're part of this family now and I want to make sure that you're okay You're not gonna hurt yourself ever and that you're going to make sure you keep getting that professional help and it's all great Because you're just an amazing person you really are And you have a lot to share with this world and I honestly believe that I would love To be able to sometime Do the pts PTSD end of these reviews and see how it helps some of our our veterans out there and I know that in like Arizona and California That you can be a military Even PTSD is one of those things that they do cover and that you can get your medical license with it I also know that dispensaries give a constant Discount for headphones. However, I know you live in Dallas and that's not you know feasible for you right now I wish it was god. I wish it was Are you meeting karidian No per idiom. Yeah, actually I am you are so correct for it It is one of those and it was one that I read that says it will cause the same disease of the empath Which I think is absolutely crazy Why somebody want to take the same medicine for the disease that they have? Yes, you are. Absolutely correct, Shannon It was what I was thinking of there's another one Because that I've noticed is with a lot of the depression or anti-anxiety medications those two also will cause like suicide effects or suicide tendencies or You'll hear those those suicidal thoughts in your head. It does cause you know, it's one of the side effects of it So I'm I've always been like what the hell I don't understand So we're gonna do kind of a hot and hurtful Down here, see how we get some real good effects and to be honest with you After that last nap, that would have been my fourth down to the bay. So I've already done a couple of cows I can honestly tell you that when I'm just sitting here as long as I'm not breathing The pain is okay So when I start to take that deep breath Then it really hurt so smoking high works Because although every time that what I have to breathe Okay a pause and then do my breath and then go Because that's one of the things that is really, I mean it hurts you guys deep breath But when I'm just sitting here try like this Without breathing it doesn't hurt anymore. So the cannabis he is helping in that aspect But we all find out free This is the dab that keeps on giving you anyway Sorry, I'm trying to meet and really doesn't work very well When I'm in SoCal a couple of years ago, I did a couple of dispensary shops and I got a military discount Yeah, I think most places - military discounts now Which I think is really cool. I Took it for years almost weaned off of it now a quarter tab a night Oh pain medication yeah, I'm you know, I'm sadly completely off of paying that is annoyed now except for tylenol that I took over the counter and Yeah, it sucks. It really sucks But you know even now I Said I am NOT On anything and I have said for quite some time now, I don't want anything stronger than like a percocet or a vicodin and at that there, you know, he even said I'm you know that when they do these types of surgeries and I went into this surgery him tank telling me that he was going to Prescribe three days worth of percocet. That's what he said He was good. He was gonna you know it on I was good with that. I'm okay with that I don't want to be on it here at home and I've told everybody that they all know But don't tell me you're gonna give me something and then turn around and not give me anything That's not kosher I smoked for my Bobby last Tuesday, how did it help crew? How did it help for your mommy house? How did it work on your mind when you smoked that's the one of the biggest questions that I have for you? Jenna no, Brian, but yeah coming off from it was informative I found I was better when I was 75% off but miserable and worn off Yeah, I get that I had an addiction to it for many many many years and Cannabis helped me wean off I would not have been able to get off with those those perks that are biking in other than being cut off by the doctor without The cannabis I used quite a bit cannabis for many years To wean myself off of it that cravings are bad at times and there yep and better at others You see I still get those cravings for for like the IV notations because you get it taste and then you want it so I've always been afraid that my body would then start, you know reacting to that and start gets start start forcing me to get sick because I had Those cravings for those those, you know products IV fluid in that IV medicine But I never used street drugs or anything like that Graduate yeah, and I did gradually decrease myself off of pain meds and The end was the worst and it's I don't have pain all the time Oh, let me rephrase if you have pain all the time, but I can control that pain with medicate with with with cannabis medication. I Pain is harder to control. Oh No, the question was how did it work mentally for you When you smoked last week I know it's tough for you to be able to smoke because you're in Dallas but Mentally, where were you at when you smoked? Yeah cannabis is absolutely key I even have slim Rick Simpson oil in the freezer right now freezing itself. So that way I can Eat that here in a few minutes and hopefully, you know I'll eat that and then I'll hold it down and hopefully I won't have any pain at all Okay So, yeah It's just good. It's just good I damn it. We're so still hot and hurtful I'm putting it for talking I end up talking and then we forget what I'm doing So let's go and eat this hooker back up again and a little hurtful Please bring your cool down too quickly Okay, you're destroying another that could be called and the city work may work for that yes, no me neither Okay ASSA that is what I was looking for see here That's our allowance and their whole thing was they were afraid it if the wind to the VA and they had cannabis in their system that they would lose their benefits while the VA year sentence Mel Will give it to you not a big deal what I would love to see I can't get the grant I put it there what I love to see is that If you're a military person Luis should be able to claim medical marijuana on our insurance Insurance should be paying for this if it's medical marijuana if it's recreational then no But medical marijuana, I believe should be paid for by by your insurance The insurance Nowadays the way that they're screwing everything up They should be allowing candidates in my opinion and I do know of a couple of cases that did win in court and did get insurance to cover as always guys fuck cancer I Find the certain strains making my PTSD words heavy - Timmy sativas Intrusive thoughts and flashbacks works for me me too. Me too. It's why don't do it well I do city was when I tried not I try to get more of a heavier ethica for me from for my My significant other my husband I can have the stickiness So I still review both, but I usually they'll smoke a bowl event after this just because of how you're feeling. I Tried oh gee coach for PTSD. It helped balance. Anxiety. This is all Filter and guess what? Feelings, but I'm totally a teensy lightweight Okay, yeah, I had to work my way up to it too But I will tell you that they work the Rick Simpson oil helped me. Um Get myself up there. I'm like what I Need blue dream was good for PTSD but didn't help me. Okay So have you found if any way have you been able to try any of the strengths that I have reviewed obviously algae could No G Kish would be good for that. But any of these others cuz I am several that are not only indica related, but they're also PTSD related and I wasn't in the military However, as a child I was in my mother didn't want me. She didn't like me and she made it very clear So I was abused Sexually physically and emotionally throughout the first fit-up 20 years of my life so well technically eight to Almost 19 years of my life because I moved out a minute I could I Moved out when I was 18 years old so it was a lot better and then I had to deal with all of the problems that happened and the phone calls and everything else because it was difficult and then it was complete lack thereof phone calls, so First it was my mom. And first it was my mom was with the phone calls, and then it was nothing From my dad so it was you know, I don't know a messed up time and I do believe that a lot of these strains Help but one of the things that helps me the most is this channel being able to talk about it with you guys And tell you what I've gone through being able to get it off My chest has been really really amazing and for that I want to thank you guys Jenn yeah, a childhood abuse - you know, it was a different time back then a very different time back then if If if a parent was caught doing something to their kid unless it was extremely extremely extremely bad The kids were left there. I seen police officers I've seen kids that got beaten bloody like me and Kids were left there because the parents said oh this kid was he was in a school fire? he was whatever he got into a fight at school and I grounded him so he got mad and he Called the police and so they left the kid at home and that was done a lot Abuse was way different We suffered through a lot of abuse that wasn't recognized And that's hard it's hard for a lot of us and a lot of us end up with nightmares from this I Blocked it out. I don't know how but I was able to tune block out all those bad memories Yeah, I got just I ended up with domestic - with my first and second husband Don and I technically are not married. I say it on all my channels because I've gotten a lot of Horrible things sent to me because I was single so and I've earned not because I'm single but because I wasn't married so that's how that works, Don and I don't want we don't really kind of believe in marriage but Kinda it turned out it was just for my peace of mind because I was getting horrible pictures. I mean, come on guys I Only hate favorite hybrids and sativas and that is good because that's most of what you're going to find on the shelf I prefer personally most of my Top ten list is pure the pure indicas And the reason for that is because I thought I would like a pure indica Most people don't because it has a really yucky taste to it But the effects are amazing So It doesn't really bad taste up Even a full bread you can tell a full bread library. You can have a full bread Smoke from a hybrid smoke purely on the taste because the taste is bad so Yeah So that is it for today guys I am going back to bed. Oh Hold on My sake hey - Trish is trying to diagnose me with complex PTSD Because of the trauma happened over and over light shows that abuse followed up by adult length abuse Like abusive partner. Sorry, I'll be able to read It's not as recognized as PTSD rod - right? Nice to see you, so that is the free day guys. I hope you have a beautiful wonderful day Mad luck to all of you and I will see you tomorrow Okay", "9vuzZ839KjU": "hello friends my name is Elin today in this exciting mission your media tutorial we're gonna be taking a look at how to use some cool techniques to get a dreamy angelic look inside of DaVinci Resolve so the first thing that we have here is this nice shot of miss Ally Taylor looking fabulous you see we're shot up against a white background aka a cloudy sky you know the giant softbox in the sky as they say and this is going to make it really easy for this look you can do it with any sort of thing and so you know make your own look with it but this is just a really nice way to get this really dreamy sort of like fashion you know high-fashion etc type stuff that people like so we're going to add a serial number up s and then a layer noel right after that in this bottom row you're going to drag a Gaussian blur on top of it you see make it all nice and blurry we're going to make this all the way blurry change our border type to reflection so you can see we get nice sharp borders on there and then we're going to desaturate it all the way it just gives us lots of fun now this right now is not a very fashionable look so what we're going to do is right click on the layer node go to composite mode and click on screen and now you can see loo look how dreamy that is now a cool way with doing it this way is you can adjust how much you want your shadows to be you know dream it up and how much you want your highlights to so if you want really dreamy shadows but you want you know a little more clarity in your highlights you just move your curves around and that will do it for you so that's really cool or you want to clean up your shadows just to have a little bit of light wrap around on the highlights you can do that too very cool I like I like being real Mielke so that is you know that is very very cool in my book I think so then after that you can do any sort of normal color grading that you want so you can add a lot if you want and of course use one from the infamous house let's back and we'll do murky waters will be a cool one yeah that's pretty fashionable or you know it's sad and rainy oh yeah that is it very cool like that's very la vlogger type of look one more nickel are yeah that's it that's the one but you know you can do any sort of treatment that you want and of course you still can do normal adjustments to your original image so say you wanted to especially since we have this soft knee I would normally never do this to a lady but you can make your camera look more expensive you just set your mid-tone detail crazy and since we have all that other washi out stuff that's going to make it real you know cool and dimensional looking so you can't be trim yeah so you can see before you get hit alt shift Z to go to actual size so before you know it's normal and nice and smooth looking where you add that knits or punch and normally that will bring out like nastiness on your subject but alleys pretty enough that you can pull it off and you know we also have all those other blurriness going around so really makes it stand out and cool and expensive looking which is always nice if that isn't blurry enough for you which it should be you can always just add more serial nodes also under here and scoop up up crazy but I think that's a little bit too much for me we're going to keep it nice and normal like that so I mean if that doesn't look desktop background II you know fashion mall etc I don't know what is can add some saturation since this is a warm LUT on top we can cool down the original image look at that that is cool so just like that we've taken a shot that anyone any idiot can get just go outside on a cloudy day no lights just just a camera a pretty girl and then make it look you know like you spent some money on it so anyway hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you like to give a like if you did give

hope you enjoyed this tutorial once it going to Athiya with mr. medium have a great day and I will see you next time bye surprise bonus tip for those of you that stuck around so I was playing around with footage trying to cope with the tutorial idea right after record the last one and some of the cross this so it's it's the exact same thing as we were doing before so I'll do this alt s and then at a Gaussian blur here and just blur it all the heck and change this to reflection except for this time well be first of all so the saturation is zero and make sure this is set to screen so you see this looks pretty bad in this shot because of the way it is but what if we just wanted to make it look like there is fog in here so what we do to make it look like this shot is foggy when it's not as you can see well it just looks there you go as you can see in the flat shot it's not foggy you know we had a fog machine on set but oh well you know aside from the point so we can do to make a look like there's fog is bring the highlights down in the curve bring the mid-tones digit it up so we just get fog you know in the shadows here or wherever we want it so that is a very cool thing so you can see we get this awesome you know foggy appearance which is very cool then you know if you want to add more contrast after that to play around a much if that will work with this yeah that kind of gets a little bit bright you can do anything I think you want with that that is a very cool thing I just figured out about so if you don't post that you can once again thanks for sticking around tutorial yeah you know bonus tips are always fun once again everything with me some meter have a great day and I will see you next time bye", "6hI1oRR9gKU": "row row row your blunt full of cbd i'm
