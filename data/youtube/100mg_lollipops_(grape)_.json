{"ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to

beast lollipop has everybody been asking so yeah it is um you know a lot of people have been asking me can you get high of a cannabis lollipop right hmm how about a little more i don't know so that's what we're about to find out today guys let's see if we can get high of cannabis lollipop but before i try i want to do some research on the internet and as you guys can see right here what it says about the cannabis lollipop and actually i bought this in the street sorry in amsterdam and what i found out here on the website it says that anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop here in the netherlands doesn't contain any thc so i don't think uh lollipop i cannot this lollipop can get you high to be honest guys but we about to find out today it's about to go down let's go guys first of all as you can see i act this is how it leaked with the amsterdam written on it and you have the lead logo on it let me open it and try this so we can [Music] see if you can really get high of cannabis lollipop or not but as we already know the answer guys you can get half cannabis lollipop though i'm gonna go ahead and try it anyway to show you guys so if anybody ever show you or you can hear how the cam is really about that that's [ __ ] actually as it says and let me open this it's just a little bit hot to open guys [Music] [Laughter] are you serious [Music] do a few moments later finally guys [Music] that's a whole lot of work to open the lollipop it wasn't i noticed so i opened it it was very sticky it's very sticky um [Music] actually it smells like weed to be honest okay [Music] oh hold on a minute guys [Music] i don't like the taste to be honest guys like i don't like the taste but for some people it might taste good it tastes like sweet actually and i haven't noticed any effect on i get how to feed anything like that just to say that's easy i want to do the research now anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop doesn't contain any thc and if you don't have thc in your canopies you can get high like so if anybody ever tells you how this that's [ __ ] because you can't get high off it cannot be lollipop it doesn't contain chc so it's just like our regular candy so if you have a key definitely don't recommend you to buy this for a kid guys because uh cannabis is drugs it's legal in some countries some countries not so i can't recommend any mother or family person to buy this for their kid no if you ever see this as i just ignore it but just so you know you can't get out of this i don't give that to my kids to be honest i won't give this to my kids but i'm just saying like it tastes pretty much okay but bruh oh if you make my thongs green right [Music] actually it doesn't taste that bad to be honest but for me i don't like these just like locris they you know so how do i recommend you guys to buy these yeah if you're 18 upwards i recommend easier to buy this you can actually find it in most of the shops in the upstate area most of the shops around upside you can find this here so you don't need to go to a coffee shop to buy a cannabis lollipop guys wait a minute you can buy a almost every shop here in amsterdam oh that says on the reset that i did you can only buy anything that contains thc in the cannabis shop so don't let anybody try to play you anybody trying to fool you or make you feel like oh i just take two of these or i just get half a cannabis lollipop because that's [Music] not me so here you have it guys you can get out of this [ __ ] so [Music] and the coffee shop is about to close in 10 minutes time so you know what's up guys my [ __ ] i gotta go born today see you next time guys and don't forget to subscribe like share my vlog have a nice day guys", "2zjR0bzWFhY": "let's pop what you already know that

and you know if you want it as long as you're true", "ID_y1ArCBmU": "I'll start things off with grape lollipops it's a perfect introduction to candy making so the first thing I need to do is prepare my lollipop mold you don't need to buy a fancy mold to make lollipops you can actually create your own what I have is a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm going to sift 2 to 3 cups of icing sugar on to the tray have a nice thick layer of icing sugar the amount you need really just depends on the size of your tray basically you want about half an inch layer of icing sugar just grab a spatula when you're spreading out your icing sugar do it loosely don't pack it down and the bigger the tray you use well the more lollipops you can fit on now that I have an even and pretty level layer I can create my lollipop shapes what you want to do is take a flat bottom glass in any shape you want and press it into the icing sugar packing it right down and take a little peak to make sure that you have clearance of about a quarter inch maybe just a little less all the way around this is where you're going to pour in your hot sugar to shape your lollipop you can find lollipop sticks at some grocery stores but definitely at stores that sell baking supplies and I press it into the icing sugar so that one end of the stick goes right into the mold there we go now I'm all set what I love about making lollipops at home is the fact that you can control the flavor and the color and you can go all natural using clear fruit juices is a great way to add flavor and color so I'm making grape lollipops by using grape juice I'm measuring out half a cup of grape juice now on its own this grape juice is too thin it won't add in a flavor or color so what I need to do is reduce it I'll put it in a small sauce pot turn up the heat on high and I want to reduce this down to about 2 tablespoons by volume this will only take a few minutes and you could use any juice you want so long as it's a clear juice that way your lollipops are nice and clear there we go my juice is reduced to now a syrup two tablespoons worth because the water has evaporated away so you're left with that concentrated flavor color and sweetness so now we're all set to start the actual lollipops first I put a quarter cup of water in the bottom of my pot that way it makes it easier for the one cup of sugar I add to immediately start dissolving you want to liquefy that sugar pretty quickly and then typical to a lot of candy making corn syrup white corn syrup is a common ingredient that really gets the clarity and the set to your candy making so I'm adding a quarter cup I'll set my heat to high which is how you cook all of your sugar when your candy making and that sugar boils and it boils beyond 212 Fahrenheit you want to cook it all the way to 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's called hard crack in the candy making world and it's before it turns to caramel but yet it sets up so that your lollipops have a nice crunch using a thermometer is important in candy making that's how you know you've hit your temperatures precisely but as the sugar starts melting and coming to a boil and throughout the process I occasionally take a brush dipped in cool water and just brush the sides of the pot this ensures that any sugar that might boil up and hit the side of the pot doesn't then cool down and crystallize give this a little check I'm at 235 the goal is 300 I can tell I'm getting close because the bubbling of the sugar is starting to slow because the sugar itself is thickening up there we go once your sugar hits the 300 degrees take it off the heat and then you want to add that concentrated grape syrup and give it a quick stir in immediately it adds that gorgeous purple color and I can smell the grape now you take your ladle and pour in to each mold make sure you're covering that lollipop stick if you find your sugar is starting to set up on you you can always put it back on the stove on low heat to remelt the sugar and this is where you can get creative with your decorations you could add sprinkles a few draws a is like I'm adding finished with a few more small ways once you're finished with your lollipops you want to give them 15 to 20 minutes to set up then it's time to take them out of the icing sugar they will have icing sugar on them from the mold so first I take a little brush to brush them off and take a lightly moistened cloth or paper towel and just wipe off the icing sugar and then I dry it off and there you can actually see right through it once they're cleaned up and have had a chance to air dry a little bit then you can pack them up in little sello bags for gifting or just store them in an airtight container until you need them I bet you never guessed that making lollipops was actually so easy an all-natural to love that nice grape flavor it just looks so sweet", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored by the wonderful

"F6hl6Z8-5UE": "and as soon as I said that Jeff's phase change from happy magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet man the sauce squad it's your boy man Yeung done the sauce God today's winner of their

"kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at

at dozers cannabis infused strawberry lemon-aid comes up consumption advice on the back we're gonna ignore all of that comes with some nutrition facts as well but you're always handy to serving size 120 calories so there are 240 calories in this 16 fluid ounce bottle so this dozer has 100 milligrams of THC serve shake well serve ice-cold just came out of the fridge looking forward to it first time trying to drink on wheats so let's see both how it tastes and how it makes us feel and like with all our wheats mini-reviews what we do is we take the entire product down it and then I come back to you guys in two hours I'll let you know how we're feeling so not further ado let's open this bad boy up shake well again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you so much for watching guys and we'll catch you on the next video", "7sbBD0UQ7BQ": "was weird how your life changed but it's all right man started smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure

to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "6DEkaswGQWM": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeds the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking a look at a brand new product from a brand new company when we've never looked at before that is premium Cali dreams candy company they're a hundred and twenty milligram THC medical cannabis lozenge although I don't think it's a lozenge at all I think it is a caramel apple pop with 120 milligrams of THC big fan of the caramel apple pops it's a weird combination but the apple flavored lollipop with caramel on the outside it's great never had one with Whedon before especially one without 120 milligrams I picked this up for I believe 13 bucks at my dispensary although it was on a going out of we're no longer selling these soon to be illegal edible special for 50% off so I got it pretty cheap I'm excited to try it I always like different kinds of edibles and a caramel apple blowing pop sounds pretty good so for 13 bucks 120 milligrams is pretty good for that price especially for something that's not just a brownie or cookies something a little different like a lollipop like the packaging from the outside pretty basic stuff but uh but nice enough as is let's go ahead and shut up now and open it up and see what this bad boy tastes like and if this is the first time you're tuning into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some number of this product well probably not gonna eat close to the whole thing because it's a big lollipop but I'm gonna eat some of it let you know do a taste test let you know how it tastes how it smells all that good stuff then I'll finish it off and for the most important part I'll come back in two hours to actually let you know how I am feeling guys because that is the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes alright so here is the pop here it's kind of smushed into this little container it's seems like it's gonna be hard to get out but let's give it a go okay came right out nothing to worry about so there it is there's the caramel apple what is this called again Cali dreams medical cannabis lozenge 120 milligrams handsome looking product give it a lick it's not bad no real cannabis taste can't detect any cannabis taste while just looking through it here I don't have the cojones to just bite straight into this but the taste at least so far pretty good if if it changes if there's something with a lollipop that's wrong or if the caramel eventually gets a weedy taste I'll be sure to let you know in the to our follow up but for now I quite like the taste of this one and like the funky style so guys I'm going to finish this off and then I will be back with you in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheat see you soon [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours here are the fruits of my labor the demolished remains of the Cali dreams 120 milligrams of THC caramel apple pop although that's what I'm calling it they call it a medical cannabis lozenge which it is not I liked it it's uh it's gotta be pretty high not not outrageously high not it's not super crazy effective it's not as good as a equivalently a good you know cookie or brownie it's not as good as like a hundred and fifty milligram Korova for example but I do like things that are a little bit different and I think this one's a little bit different it tasted good pretty much the whole way through the lollipop had a little bit of a Candace cannabis flavor but nothing too bad it was totally totally fine then at and you know was far from making me gag I said that's not the best descriptor but yeah it was pretty tasty the caramel was good I liked it it was a good way of getting THC and if you can find it 50% off like I did it's a hell of a deal at 13 bucks I still think it's not a bad price it is something that unlike a cookie or a brownie or rice krispies treat or whatever else you can't really split it being a lollipop so that might be you know something to strike against and you're gonna be taking this whole thing by yourself and you can't really save it for later either you can't really have half of it otherwise you just have a sticky mess so it's something you've got to commit to if that's you know what you're looking for for me it's a it's a middling endorsement for the Cali dreams hundred and twenty milligrams you see the dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little different a little outside the mold give it a try I think you'll be happy you did thanks so much for watching wheats guys that's going to do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "hqAwGzGWXyE": "hello and welcome to another episode of DOS

review we are talking my favorite company on the planet we're talking canna Co another one of their 100 milligram erse one that I've never reviewed any of their this this one on any level before but I'm excited to do it because I love these kind of things and that's Kanako's 100 milligram lemon bar that's right 100 milligram lemon bar from canna Co super super excited I've loved every single can of coke product I've reviewed I've loved every milligram egde I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "ATYn-KBNgc8": "what's up everybody welcome back to another episode of strange city today guys gonna be reviewing mile-high suckers um we're gonna got the we got the mixed berry flavor working with 10 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of THC so that is what we have got going guys just getting into it here and open it up for you it does have a yes do have to bite it or open it with scissors because it is childproof guys so do mind that that it is not gonna have a seal I would open it the other way I just walked up so you got your lollipop here it's got an imprint of THC with an M underneath to say medical or to dictate medical tastes really good but we're gonna get out of here guys see you shortly 30 minutes an hour so I'm like that not sure gonna let this kick in and we'll come back and I just loved you guys off meant to do it a piece but with bad guys to review this after we're high from it peace guys what's up everybody welcome back to the second part of this lollipop mile ha sucker review guys mixed berry flavor from mile high 30 milligrams of THC 10 of CBD picked up at affinity guys today the repeat that we're doing on this is gonna be the more of how to fix and things like that the first part was more of the taste I'm still eating on it obviously I didn't finish it should knock me out went to sleep but very very good guys um the taste overall when you first start into a lollipop I pop second taste is gonna be that dry Hoshi powdery type taste I don't know that house to describe it you kind of have to eat inedible to illegal edible to to kind of get that flavor or that that taste for it so thank you paying a my Lighting's perfect leave it right there so we're pancake being my lighting studio basically really really good guys I would give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and subscribe for more peace guys", "00ArNfhqkLg": "hey what's that boy girls welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at one of my favorite things out there and that is edible chocolate love the chocolate bars and we're taking a look at a huge brand today one of only reviewed one of their products foreign have found it to be not so good so we'll be interested to see if their chocolate does any better and that is flavor ex-flame rx Flav prescription I'm just gonna go flavor X I don't want to say it they're 100 milligram toffee bar Oh made by Kanak oh I had not seen that there that's exciting that hopefully makes me optimistic I didn't know this was made by Kanak oh the flavor X bars I have only tried their fruit bars before exiting back there they're they're gummy snacks and did not really enjoy them but chocolate is usually a much better vector for THC and this is a pretty huge brand I see them everywhere everywhere this is the new regulations size 10 milligram pieces 100 milligram total although it says it actually has not yet been a lab tested there again you can see Hanako so we are gonna be optimistic and hope that it is as good as the other Kanaka products and better than the Flav Rx products I've already reviewed so here we are here is our flavor X bar inside its packaging oh and this cost me 20 bucks at my Long Beach dispensary so I'm out in line with the 100 milligram edible now which is a bit unfortunate it let's dig it out and there we go pretty simple ten pieces very small pieces of chocolate I guess they're only ten milligrams and again it is toffee flavored so let's give it a try well there's some good quality chocolate mmm no cannabis tasters because I don't really taste anything but hmm good rich milk chocolate top you provide is a nice little crunch the flavor front could not be more happy with it but guys as you all know it's not about how it tastes I mean you wanted to taste good but what you really wanted to do is to get you high and for that guys like all our reviews I'm gonna finish off this flavor X bar over the next couple of minutes here and then once I finish it I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling is that's the most important part of any animal review so wish me luck I know I've got my fingers crossed I hope this one's gonna be a winner and I'll see you guys in just a bit I'm back and has actually been more than two hours since I checked in with you with the flavor rx bar I got a little ahead of myself in my activities but I am happy to tell you this is a good product um I did not like flavor X cartridges and I did not like their candy but I quite like this chocolate bar I tasted really really good on the upper end of the chocolate it's not the best of the best I've had but really pretty damn good and it's quite potent for a hundred milligram edible this really did the trick for me um I'm hoping or suspecting that the made by Cana Co is why that this one did the trick so this Flav rx chocolate bar is actually gonna get a big thumbs up from me it's not a plus tier like your Kiva or your de francais but it is close it is tasty it's pretty affordable in this new world um and uh it'll get you high so flavor X toffee 100 milligram bar that's gonna be a thumbs up for me give it a chance if you see it at your dispensary think you'll be happy you did and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on our next row deuces", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "xtj3v5cex8w": "[Music] and we won't [Music] hey yo everybody how y'all doing outbox house back at it again another new video so this time actually gonna be a little bit different normally you know

guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much

little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can

mr. food here", "72oBt-uNenk": "yo what it's up YouTube Mike cannabis family aggro bros my grow gals the cannabis enthusiasts and anybody that likes the cannabis welcome back to another video this week we're gonna discuss lolli popping this is an adults-only video so if you are 18 years or older awesome if you're not deuces alright thanks for coming by guys let's get into it I want to show you how I lollipop my plants everybody got beautiful white widow flowers over here some cornucopia action look at that oh yeah we are in one week of flower it's definitely look and I get everybody definitely definitely look like it so excited here's the canopy guys looking good looking good so a point of this video is lolli popping guys so the reason why I do it is to increase the airflow underneath the canopy of the plants also to get rid of any growth that you don't need the plant produces all the energy from the soil to grow with the lights we add the co2 because it's what they use to metabolize all their foods in the soil and in your nutrients and all that good stuff so the point of this is to only establish a certain amount of growth to use all that energy if you have a ton of energy underneath your canopy you guys that's black and darkness it's not gonna do very good for Europe plants you want to make sure that you're maintaining them and giving them a good haircut you know every few weeks that's kind of what I do sometimes I wait a little longer sometimes I don't usually just depending on the health of all the plants so before here we go as a before picture or video I guess you could say of the plants on this side before my lollipop II you can see all this growth on the bottom I mean this is perfect timing if your cloner man you can I could probably get a hunter this all today what I've already pulled out but look at all this growth in the bottom guys like see the darkness sitting by the darkness like you don't really need any of this growth down here this is just not it's not gonna be sufficient to put the energy in the plan you know to do all that you're not gonna grow much you're not gonna you're not gonna produce many you know cola tops as you want then the plants going to establish all that energy across different branches and then you have small branches a weiner is like this look at this guy down here like I'm cutting that off that's definitely coming down the darkness guys look at all the darkness you don't that's energy wasted right there 100% 100% energy waste and all that darkness and all those plants right here all this all these like all that everything basically from the net below is what I trimmed down so we can just maximize the airflow in the garden so here's a good good view of before I'm just gonna swing over to the other side real quick to get an after swing on over to this side real quick all right so here's the other side guys you can kind of see even on the top side right here I can see down below into the you know under the floor a little bit which is often that means the lights penetrating that down there also which is very good that just means we're just great light coverage that's all that means I got to 315 Sun system le sees I have my enhancer going finally all you gotta do is get up there cover that little hole so you don't get stuff on you Google shake and you can hear the happiness that's just gonna boost my plants up and heal them up quicker than later alright guys so here is the after band everything has been chopped down you can see all the trimming and everything that I cut off everything dig a little stressed out of course cuz it's trimming out a lot of your plan I mean you're getting rid of 30 40 percent of your plant probably not 40 but more like 30 and that's just man that's just a lot have a good cornucopia here guys I mean good plant training I've been doing that's how you just maximize your yields look up all those coal is just shooting up that wouldn't happen if you just didn't train your plants look at this one you can see a really solid topping really solid nodes right here pretty sweet that's a nice topping there's another topping right in here how you train your plants down in here you got the topping right here and then now you have two main stalks but I've had two main stalks you have like you know two four five six seven eight nine ten main tops coming up creating a sexy canopy of just you know beautiful stacking to like you know all this is just gonna be stacking up to be just snugs and colas baseball bats you can trim some of these leaves off because they're not useful but there is my after you guys all these plants are doing good let's get a rundown of the plants here we got a cornucopia in the back going on a corner we got the brisker Pakistan Valley or chill out OG from mr. grow it right here we got the strawberry diesel looking awesome white widow that is I've got to trim the hell that one but she is just killing it little tiny strawberry juice along a little 2 gallon pot right here just blowing up nice good tops on that one wouldn't be surprised if I don't get some good stuff got another cornucopia from brother Mendel selections just looking beautiful another Brit skier Pakistan belly or chill out og see how I topped it and just stress train the heck out of it super beautiful and then here is a Skywalker og just killing the game right now got all this beautiful structure coming up just to create big colas and nuggets everywhere if you guys see wizard mpk man that guy does some really good

great day", "WCVxYDEFzBM": "[Music] on greetings everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary so what are we reviewing this week brand new brand we're looking at just dab bytes cookies-and-cream 120 milligrams my guess is it as a cereal bar like so many other edibles it's quite large for a cereal bar this first time ever having anything from just dab so I'm looking forward to it you can see the ingredients there on the back are a little sparse cereal marshmallow butter vanilla extract crafted on May night not much else to stay of this other than the dumb 120 milligrams is in like the creepy font for some reason so let's just couldn't open it up and get straight to it if I can figure out how to open up this package I wouldn't be getting straight to it so you know oh wait here we go there's the little tear strip yes everybody it looks like a rice krispies treat with some Oreo in it looks good no well there is a weed owner but not too bad there's a lot of Oreo odor as well let's go and have a bite that's not so good it's dry and it's not chewy and moist and like when you bite it doesn't come across like cheese like the best rice krispies it's like has that gooey texture does not have that it's pretty and look the steel or you on the inside does not go well with the marshmallow rice oh it's not terrible but I don't love it um so that's the just dab bytes cookies and cream not so good not so hot in terms of the taste Department but as we all know the most important thing is not how it tastes but how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna have to come back to you in two hours to let you know how this just dab bar is working I'm gonna finish this bad boy up and I will see you guys then peace hello everyone welcome to wheats it's been two hours since I had the just dab bytes hundred and twenty milligram cookies and cream breakfast bar um and it's alright it's not great it was didn't taste great that's for sure they messed up the thing that seems to be very difficult to mess up which is like a rice krispies bar wasn't that tasty this kind of dry and stale tasting but I am I'm not disappointed with how high I am for 120 milligram in a bowl I'm not outrageously high but I'm pleasantly stoned about in line sort of right on the average end of 120 milligrams at a bowl a price range about what you would expect that as well ten to twelve dollars depending on the day so yeah did it taste as good as I was hoping I mean it wasn't disgusting by any means it's no enjoy goldfish or Korova salted caramel but it just wasn't great but the high is is is is okay so I'm gonna give this one a pass don't love it don't hate it looking forward to trying some other things from them I think I've got a cookie coming up in the queue to review from them looking forward to that now so with that that should do it for this episode here on weeks I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace terrible I mean it hit the camera but it's still bad bye hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like

thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "qZ-FcJAVJPw": "welcome back guys back here in the garden do with some lollipop and on the plants and what I am doing is preparing the plants while I'm doing the lollipop and one third of the way up this plant I am preparing this branch right here to be pollinated probably about three weeks into flowering we still got some time but what I am doing is segregating men nothing else around it and same thing with others the other plants that's exactly what I'm doing just segregating the one branch each plant so I can pollinate it I'm still of a search and hunt for some pollen so I I would like to cross it with fungus resistant but most of them are already fungus to resist that I just wanted to double down on it if I can find that what I am doing is tree the airflow for these fans and natural airflow to just yes do what it needs to also the light get may be here for what needs to be the light penetration so I don't know what your plan is a little bit easier to see you guys got other plants and I want to show ya oh let's go just to that got some technical difficulties with the chair alright we're back on so I've got a few plants out here that it's already been lollipop as you can see that this one right here pretty good it's cleaned out also and I got one branch that are probably getting kind of skinned up more what I'm gonna be doing is when I pollinate this I will be taking a one gallon bag put pollen in the bag putting it over a ziploc in the bag on here for coming to three days when it's about three weeks in the flower and I will remove that and then I'll wash it off with a dart hose or something like that and that's why it's kind of segregated away from the plan so that's how I was told to pollinate it I've never pollinated before so it'll be the first time but I'm just trying to keep the fungus resistant strains go even in this garden and broaden them brought in the strains so anybody's got me pollen I would love to talk to you hit me up so as you can see over here I've got a few plants already lollipop tub and cleaned out you can see she's beautiful it's the way I like to see her now you can see eight here she is all cleaned out so few other plants I'm gonna go double back down and clean them back out a little bit more but it's a process as you see I got some branches kind of selected and kind of pulled off to the side now what I'll do is probably tie this right here and [Music] kind of separate it more over from plant and everything else especially when it goes to the flower when I do the pollination so I've got a few plants that I've cleaned up a little bit I'm gonna go back fling them up a little bit more but you can see everything is looking beautiful cleaned up durbin poison cleaned up pretty good now another strain I want to keep going is this grape headband I would love to cross it with something just and keep this denied in the picture look at this beetle it she's already 9 foot tall she's 19 and a half foot why she's a beast seriously okay let's look at the face of her oh so this is about the face of her Oh pull to pull and then it's beat routed and then all of this is protruding I mean that's uh that's about four and a half foot holes up there those're that's a beast I would love to keep this feet oi in the picture when it comes to bringing this strain this is this grape headband I have this grape headband and then this grape had been over here so we're gonna stalk on an irony that's a regular Dixie cup that's a beefy beefy stalk no gouramis this is what's going on in the garden and when I do buy a lollipop and this is what I am preparing the plants for this year all right your home is so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of my I'm gonna let you go roll yours let me do know what you do when you do your lollipop in how you take care of your planet do you give it any I don't know recovery juice as you would say that's why I gave mine that compost tea prior to doing this just to prepare it prepare for just a little bit of shot so girl is if anybody is local and you are in a pinch and just need some cuttings seriously hit me up I am here to try to help the community stay tuned and I'm gonna get back to my chores they'll see what the dogs barking at [Music] and remember try to segregate your plants from that what your pollinated to your other branches and surroundings just because yes I'm sure there could be a possible risk of pollinating something else so this is what I'm preparing for stay tuned", "Le6Ox7avobQ": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm gonna show you so I have these three that I got from Canada's mom that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love you guys so so much and again I'm so sorry you had trouble with the last recipe I posted they bring you recipes because they're simple easy and they're [ __ ] good and if I screw up I'm sorry just make a girl aware slap a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you",

you there set up", "xKHP-1wefq8": "- Hi, Andrea Meharg here\nfrom revealcannabis.com, where I teach you how you can use cannabis to live a healthier, happier life. And today's video is all about how to make cannabis infused beverages. This is really exciting for us Canadians who don't have cannabis infused\nbeverages on the market yet. They will be coming in October of 2019, but for right now, I'm gonna teach you how to make your own. Basically, what I'm\ngonna show you how to do is to make a simple cannabis tincture that you then add to the\nbeverage of your choice. I'm gonna walk you really quick how to make an alcohol tincture because I already have a longer\nmore detailed video on that that I'll link below. And at the end of this video I will provide you with a recipe book that can hopefully stir\nup your creative juices for what you could make with your cannabis infused tinctures. So let's get started. I'm gonna show you what you'll need to make the tincture first. Okay, first thing that you have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. So, basically this is\nheating your cannabis up so that you are getting THC or CBD instead of what's naturally\nfound in the plant, which is THCA or CBDA. The easy way to do this at home is to put your cannabis into a mason jar and put it into a preheated oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. The reason you put it in the mason jar is it helps to keep down the smell. However, if you have one of\nthese beautiful little machines, you just put your cannabis in and press the button and away you go, when it's done it shows a different color. Again the advantage of this is that you get more of the\nTHC or CBD from the flower. After you're done, you are\ngoing to grind your cannabis just slightly to increase\nthe surface area, you're not trying to turn it into powder. So you just zap it a couple of\ntimes in your coffee grinder. If you don't have a coffee\ngrinder for cannabis, that's okay use scissors or\nyour regular cannabis grinder. So I'll show you that it looks like that, right now the nugs and I'm gonna go zap it off camera so you don't have to listen to it. So, put your ground up\ncannabis into a mason jar, same mason jar you used to decarb it, if you used the oven which is fantastic. I'm all about less dishes. So it looks like that when it\nis just a little bit ground. And then you're gonna\nadd in 1/2 cup of Alcool, or Everclear or whatever you're using. So I'm using seven grams of cannabis and one 1/2 cup of Alcool. You can increase the\npotency of your tincture or decrease it by using\nless flower or more flower, less alcohol or more alcohol. So I'm gonna shake this up, and then all you do is you\nput this into a crock pot that has water that covers\nthe amount of your tincture, and you're gonna put this\nin your crock pot on low for about eight hours\nand then you'll be done. So, thanks to the magic of television. I already have a cannabis\ntincture ready to go. So when you're done, you simply dump it into a\ncheesecloth lined strainer. The other thing I've seen people do is use a reusable nut milk bag, so those are bags that people use to make almond milk or cashew\nmilk and they're reusable. So you put it into your little satchel, your cheesecloth satchel and then actually like get right in there and really squeeze this. You do not wanna lose any of your beautiful\ntincture to the garbage. I know people do lots of stuff with the satchel of cannabis leftover when it's infused into butter or oil. You can make it into high chai or you can just dump that\nright into some baked goods. But when it's done with\nalcohol, it tastes terrible and I haven't seen any\ngood uses for it yet. So if you see a good\nuse for this at the end, please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, just squeeze\nuntil you feel like you've got it all out. You're gonna store this\nbeautiful mixture in one of these to keep it away from the sun, and then I'm gonna show you how to make some infused\nbeverages, let's go. Before we go any further, I wanted to point out three things. First, make sure that\nyou open your mason jar that's sitting in the warm water about every 1/2 hour to an hour while it is infusing in there to let go of some of the pressure, that's called burping your mason jar. Second, if you are trying\nto get a CBD tincture, then just make sure that you\nstart out with cannabis flower that's really high in CBD. This is a great recipe to have on hand because you can really\ncustomize the ingredients and get the exact type of\ntincture that you'd like. In fact, some people even\ninfuse other herbs and flowers into these tinctures. Let's think about some\nof the delicious drinks that you can make now that you know how to make a cannabis tincture. So this is really where your\nimagination gets to run wild. Basically any drink that you drink can now be infused with cannabis. You just take a couple\nof drops of your tincture or a dropper full of your\ntincture, and away you go. So lots of people love to make lemonade or just put some into their coffee or tea. People infuse or have cannabis\ninfused Pop, Coke or Pepsi, whatever it is, you can really\ndo whatever you want with it. The only thing to point out is to avoid mixing cannabis with alcohol. Let's talk about dosing. How do we know how much we're getting in a dropper full of\nthat cannabis tincture? There is a way to get a\nreally good approximation, it's not gonna be totally perfect, but this is a good way to\nget a good approximation. First thing is that you're gonna find out how much THC or CBD is in your flower. If you're buying lab tested cannabis, then you can just look at the label and it will tell you how much\nof those components are in it. If you don't have it with a label, and you do know the strain name, you can head over to\nleafly.com and type it in and they'll give you an approximation of how much you THC it might have in it. And if you don't have any idea what it is then you can take a guesstimate. Average THC concentrations\nright now seem to be around 15 to 20%, so take a guesstimate. And once you know how much\nTHC or CBD is in your flower, then you can go to this\nhandy-dandy dosing calculator. So it's at the wakeandbake.co website which I highly recommend if\nyou haven't checked it out, and all you do is fill out\nthis happy little chart here. So the Tangerine Dream that I infused had 15% THC and 1% CBD, and I use seven grams of it and I infused it into 1/2 cup of alcohol. So I know that in my whole infusion, there's 1,050 milligrams of THC, and in each teaspoon,\nthere's about 43 grams. So let's go back here and\nsee what we can do with that. I just wanna say though, even though you're using\na dosage calculator, that does not absolve you of the responsibility of\nstarting low and going slow because every time you make\na new cannabis infusion, it can be slightly different, so don't depend on the dosage calculator to give you the exact precise dose, make sure that you try it first and see how this particular\nbatch fits with you. So, most recommendations are to start with five milligrams of\nTHC or less per dose. So let's talk about my\ntincture that I just made. We know that it has 43\nmilligrams of THC per teaspoon, and each teaspoon has five milliliters. In tincture bottles, the droppers are standardized to one milliliter. So there's five droppers\nin one teaspoon of THC or in one teaspoon of tincture. So 43 divided by five is about 8.5 milligrams per each dropper. So in my tincture for each dropper fall, it's about 8.5 milligrams of THC. If I was trying to get\na five milligram dose, I would have slightly\nover half of the dropper and that would be my dose. It's really easy to adjust\nthe potency of your tinctures. If you wanted a more potent tincture, you would add more cannabis\nto the same amount of alcohol. So maybe you'd add 14 grams\nof cannabis instead of seven. If you wanted to less potent tincture, you would just add less cannabis to the same amount of\nalcohol and away you go, you can really customize it. I'm gonna give you a recipe for a delicious strawberry-mint spritzer, that you just put a couple of drops of cannabis tincture into\nand then it's infused and you can have a great afternoon. So what you do is you\ntake a cup of strawberries and a 1/2 cup of fresh mint and a couple of tablespoons of sweetener, whatever you're gonna use\nand mix it up in a saucepan so that it really begins to\nbreak down and come together and the mint releases its oil, it's gonna smell super beautiful. So do that, it takes about 10 minutes and then let it cool down and put it into a\nblender or food processor and pulse it until it's smooth. Grab a glass and fill it\nup with some spritzers or soda water and then put\nin a couple of tablespoons of your beautiful\nstrawberry mint concoction that you just made and however much of your\ncannabis tincture that you want and stir it up and you\nhave a beautiful infused, delicious cocktail.

candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next episode peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "cXkpjapBxnM": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another product from milk-and-cookies the terribly neighborhood still have the price tag on it $10 you can see there go ahead and take that off milk and cookies the weirdly named and even weird early logoed edibles we are taking a look at their 20 dose which means 200 milligram red velvet cookie will read the terrible description on the back and then we'll dig into the review here okay so here's what they say sink your teeth into a satin red velvet cookie Edurne adorned with swirls of buttercream frosting and sprinkled with sugary bling each velvety bite reveals sweet silky buttercream atop a decadent red pillow go ahead lick the frosting my first we won't tell who sultry sexy now I've got my scissors here because L edible this packaging is terrible and for whatever reason does not actually include a way to open it without scissors I think that's a terrible decision a design decision of mine but you know that's what they have decided so Milton that these guys I reviewed quite a few products from them I find them to be mixed too bad for the confectionary edibles some of the things are okay like they're [ __ ] brownie and their regular brownie I found to be okay but most of their 200 milligram cookies or their rice krispies treats do not seem to get me where I want to be but they are reasonably priced so this is a $10 cookie which is a good deal for a 200 milligram edible if it were as potent as a 200 milligram edible should or could be alright so for whatever reason this cookie a little smushed too so I brought the patented wheats plate here to dump it out on I think it was purchased smushed but you know smush just one way of eating something it's just you know oh jeez it's really banged up alright so that's a knock against it is how easily this thing gets banged up so there is all the cookie the red velvet cookie all banged and crumbed up let's give it a bite so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way we do our reviews is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie I'll eat the whole thing I just don't abort you to death by eating it all in front of you hidden camera but I'm gonna eat it all over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review is not the way it tastes but how it makes you feel so let's go ahead and get a smell and taste test here no real discernible weed odor what's mmm that is better than I thought it was going to be then it's not bad and I'm not even a huge red velvet fan but that's pretty good well no we taste whatsoever or if there isn't it's masked by the cookie and the buttercream frosting buttercream frosting is good very neutral sort of taste and the cookie itself is very moist very soft and delicious I like it but as I just said who can't outrace well I care how it tastes you should care how it tastes too but well you should really care about is how it makes you feel and for that guys I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thank you so much for watching wheats I'll see you soon I'm back my friends it has been two hours since I had the MILF and cookies 200 milligram red velvet cookie and it's a pleasant little surprise I I liked it I am enjoying it um it's not great but compared to the other milk and cookies 200 milligram urse I think this is my favorite it tastes surprisingly good I was really surprised with how good it tastes and I'm um I'm not high out of my mind but I'm pretty high average n for a 200 milligrams so tastes good and above our writer average I would say high for a 200 milligram uh would not be my first choice I I would probably spend a little bit of extra money and go with a similar thing product from Korova or canna Co similar milligram egde but I don't think you're gonna be dissatisfied with the milk and cookies red velvet cookie if you happen to pick one up and if you're a huge fan of red velvet definitely give it a go you'll you'll love the taste and you'll find yourself uh pleasantly hi so this is a thumbs up from me it's again it's not fantastic it's not the best I've ever had but it is better than a lot of the other milk and cookies so if you see it under dispensary near you and you like red velvet go for it it's a good edible alright guys thank you so much for watching that's going to do on this review here on weeks thank you for watching again and we will check you out on the next review piece okay one hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "LajdW9P0yHM": "[Music] hello everyone welcome two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this episode we are looking at the similarly titled and similarly logoed we dose that's right we were taking a look at we dose we toes crunchy I think the name of the company is we dose we can see back here they really like you to know that name we chose we dose we chose loses all meaning when you say it enough we chose Medicaid his deck and the products name is we nose crunchy they make other products as well that aren't also called we dose you would think they wouldn't name their thing the same name they name their company but whatever I traditionally haven't really liked chips I haven't really found one that hits that sweet spot from me that's perfect I kind of like some of the original baked goods I kind of like some of them in Gooch and I found that those goldfish from enjoy edibles we're actually quite potent but they tasted so disgusting I couldn't ever imagine eating them again so I'm hoping that these we toast crunchy will be the pot chip for me going forward so if you've never turned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product I'm gonna eventually eat the whole thing not necessary for you to death do a lot of Cheetos in here excuse me we knows but they don't come back to you guys in precisely two hours to let you know how I'm feeling how high I am because I consider that the most important part of any edible review not so much how it tastes but how it makes you feel alright so let's go ahead and open it up see what this products all about how it tastes how it smells and then two hours from now most importantly how its gonna make this feel my guess it's gonna taste kind of like stale Cheetos with a little bit of wheat taste the weed odor is quite strong coming from the bag you can see we've got a lot of Cheetos in there look like regular ass Cheetos nothing too surprising let's go ahead and give them one a bite here not too still that's good what not bad um definitely a little bit of a wee taste to it nothing that's gonna prevent you from wanting to eat the the whole thing work that's gonna make you gag certainly um just a little bit of a pair at the end but mostly just tastes like Cheetos and not even that stale so they got a leg up on the competition um well so you know how they taste if you like she knows you're gonna like these there is a substantial amount in this bag certainly more than your typical like grab bag and she is so it's gonna take me a while get through these bad boys oh [ __ ] I said bad boys um these sons of [ __ ] how about that it's gonna take me a while you spend some [ __ ] why they're all male I don't know why I use masculine not sure but let's go ahead and I'm gonna finish these sons of [ __ ] off and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace Wow guys I am rusty it has been I'm coming up with my big tolerance break here I boosted my tolerance back up but I'm rusty I realized that I forgot to tell you two very key important facts about we dose from two hours earlier one how potent it's supposed to be this is a hundred and fifty milligram product although it's hard to find that on here you have to do a little bit of math it says oh there it is at the very bottom one hundred and fifty milligrams per bag should probably be a little bit more prominently display than that a little weird that it's that small but so this is one hundred and fifty milligram animal and it cost me traditionally it cost ten dollars but I got it on a discount for eight bucks so an affordable edible so again hundred and fifty milligrams for eight dollars affordable and bulb and I would describe we dose as it's alright it's alright um I'm not outrageously high I'm pretty high I would say I'm at whatever my tolerance was about the same as it was before equivalent to about a 5 maybe maybe about a 5 and a half or so me not to get that weirdly specifically granular because what's the difference between a 5 and a 5 and a half nothing um but but yeah they tasted I mean just like Cheetos so if you like Cheetos you're gonna like these they weren't stale the we taste wasn't that bad and I'm moderately high for an affordable edible so I've nothing bad to say about we dose and it's not really gonna change my opinion on on the chips sort of edibles I still I'm not gonna reach for these first but if I was looking for something a little bit if I was looking for something salty and this was at the dispensary and you know just was looking for not confectionery this time around maybe I grabbed a bag of weed oohs but for the most part I'm gonna stick with the confectionery you stick with the candies just I think they're a little bit more potent that's a better vector for THC but if you uh you know like the salty stuff you might want to give widows a chance because again it's it's not gonna set you back too much at 8 bucks a bag here so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you all in the next review peace that was okay and I I'm not a practice on throwing those two alright guys see you later", "xFYJ4nSvDB0": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today I'm sorry for our video and audio quality I'm just using the old iPhone 7 plus and the front camera and the native microphone but if you look behind me here we're out here in beautiful Signal Hill Southern California beautiful beautiful view so what are we talking about here today on wheats we are talking about tek oh there's snickerdoodle 160 milligrams cookie today oops got it upside down there so you can see our cookie 160 milligrams and it's a shitty little packaging I've had one gko product in the past and I actually quite liked it it was there brownie today we are gonna try there snickerdoodle cookie it's a little less potent in there brownie had 160 instead of the 200 of the brownie but I'm still looking forward to it because I'm a snickerdoodle fan and the one tki oh I had it was pretty good so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste if this is the first time you guys have ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this cookie or maybe all of it in front of you just don't want to bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's actually the most important part of any edible review alright so here's the snickerdoodle it smells a little bit like we know a lot like cinnamon and let's give her a taste stay still a little bit of a weed taste to it not too bad um mostly it just tastes like a snail very stale not very good snickerdoodle cookie so about what you'd expect from marijuana edible and about what I expect from TKO because I remember the brownie not tasting so quite so good but having the more important part it was quite potent so sorry for talking with my mouth full see you guys in two hours welcome back to week 2 boy it's been two hours since I had bt k o 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie and um quite a bit uh not in love with it but I do like it um it's an affordable cookie I think it cost me eight bucks so really on the cheap end for 160 milligrams Emmel and right in the average range for being high in the 160 milligram and of all I mean it's not a kirova or it's not like a bang bar it's not outrageously good but for that price uh it gets me where I want to be at a at the right price so no complaints there it did not taste great I am a fan of the snickerdoodle cookie so I was a little disappointed in and how bad this tasted I mean it's not disgusting you're not gonna have to gag it down it's just kind of stale kind of dry not the best tasting cookie but you know it is what it is and again it is a really affordable so you sort of get what you pay for in that regard but I do recommend it I do recommend the TK OH snickerdoodle cookie just like their branding I had in the past it is a pleasant little surprise I think I like the brownie a little bit more than the cookie but you know that's about a toss up there so again the TKO 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie if you see at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little bit cheaper don't hesitate to grab one well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace well [ __ ] that was awful I'm sorry that's pathetic hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are

you know like i said i'll have shown who the winner is of the last two giveaways you know what for him lively the one for this channel um but in the future uh you know the next day or two i should be getting with him or i may have already got with him uh by the time this video comes out and so we're going to do is we're going to get something away on saint patrick's day man this is this is by far the the best card i've i've got yesterday i did the the shawn banana i think i talked to you guys about that uh this cart bumped of a full supply delta farms and of the legal buzz down a notch or half a notch um these are extremely good cards um by far my number one card right now um i told you guys also that i got um these gel caps and i'll be doing a review on that either tomorrow the next day so when i get some more money i want to watch some more of these these are really good way to dose uh your delta eight first thing in the morning you can take these just like the things we talked about before and forget all about vaping man um but the deal is we're talking about this uh great vape today but regarding that so i'm going to get with them uh and also what i'll do is i'll get with um uh david mcguinness over hemp lively and we'll see about giving something away maybe we'll make some green gummies or something like that and get some green gummies away for st patrick's day um i'll get with the matt byrne over blue and him company like i said before i want to start selling these cards um i love these cards i mean these are by far my number one card anybody that tries you know the guy went out of the way to get in touch with me um he actually contacted me about a month ago i guess and told me they had some products coming forward um and again it's kind of hard to get in touch with me because i i tend to i like my privacy too you know so i shut the phone off and stuff like that um you know people most people know that the way to get in touch with me is like right here through the youtube channel um i may let you know the comments go all day on the youtube channel but at some point during our 24 hour period i'm going to check the comments on the youtube channel so you know those guys are going to get smart at some point and start contacting me here instead of contacting me you know all these other places uh kudos to blue moon here uh company for uh you know getting in touch with me and staying in touch and staying on top because like i said man i'll you know there's probably some companies out there that are um you know they have a good product but they're not persistent and they're not thinking outside the box and always get in touch with me because really dude i'm not gonna lie to you about him and he gets a little hectic sometimes um having said that uh yesterday was my birthday um so i probably um i went out to uh miss carl smith's place and did some work out there over sweetwater alabama like i told you guys before i own a handyman business but you know with the opening of this foreign stuff i kind of got away from the handyman stuff most of my stuff was like commercial accounts in thomasville alabama for net 45 companies you know but they were all small projects and stuff like that i've done a couple other projects i kind of gotten away from the handyman thing but with the you know with the coming new store and stuff like that needing products for the store i just don't have the money that i need to do that so i'm gonna have to you know work my way and bootstrap my way through that and that's you know the handyman thing is kind of where i'm going with that so on the review of this great bay um delta a cart from blue moon hem company let me tell you something folks this is um you know gorilla glue is my favorite delta farms this is just blown gorilla glue right out of the water um i don't even know what to say about this i i think i talked to you guys yesterday about this part um that shananna cart that i had man is is probably the best strawberry cart that i've ever tasted in my life i mean it's all in the effects obviously we're showing um i've been hitting this uh great babe cart today and you can notice you know i'll put my hand behind it you'll notice the consistency and the color of it um i'll hold it over sideways so you guys can see you know it doesn't quite run uh you know it's not running real fast but like you see the viscosity of it uh these have a um a ceramic black tip uh uh metal core with uh quartz coils and viton seals let me tell you something man this is by far has moved up to my number one card um we have a code whatever you can get these cards for 20 off all day long i think they're 34.99 with 20 off you can get uh you know do the math on that but you guys can get these cards don't forget they got gel caps they got a whole bunch of other products over there they got so what i'm going to do is in the next couple days i'm going to get the next three flavors they have sent over and obviously i want some more of those gel caps which i'll do a review on that later but you guys can see this car this cart the flavor on the potencies uh probably ten and a half or eleven you know if we're talking about you know now that now that we're talking about this car right here we have to move uh delta farms down to nine and a half um and put this card at 10. i mean i really if there was an 11 we would move it to 11. um the the point is is that the other thing about this card too is like remember that's a great vape i don't think that quite describes the flavor of it if you guys are familiar with tang from back in the day um this is like a great tang man this actually when you pull in on it it actually gives you that that tang on your tongue man it's incredible to me that they were able to do that um this thing has has a potency that's just unbelievable uh see always there i'll show you guys on the back of the cart uh you see the and they they were pretty cool about that and they put that uh the seal right in the middle of that uh the you know the the seal of uh you know what to say it says silla purity and potency and they put it like right in the middle of that so that's pretty cool um this is by far the most powerful part that i've ever said i've ever noticed i'll put the code don't forget you can go to bloomington company use code whatever you get 20 off um this is tuesday i think the code wouldn't have been ready until yesterday afternoon so you guys can uh go there and take a look at that don't forget uh st patrick's day we're going to do something i'm getting with matt byrne we're going to give uh something away on st patrick's day uh from blue moon him company and then i'm going to get with uh david mcguinness from overhead lively we're going to give something away also over at hemp liver's youtube channel also so don't forget that um i'll be putting the clip for the winner of the hemp lively and the this channel's either attached to this video or i'll do a complete separate video but it will be out some time today hey folks man it's whatever guys signing off because whatever me you folks have a great week don't forget man bloomingham coming to you guys what you come out good whatever 20 off you're not going to find a better card on the market man i don't even know what to say i want to start putting these on my site running them um i'm really in love with this car hey folks what i've got signing off make is whatever me and i'll talk to you guys later see ya", "XbARWQGqxVo": "I just can't wait to get this preamble today because we are taking a look our second look at if you've seen my first video the thing that I labeled the best-tasting edible ever we're getting our second look I finally found some there carrying it here in my dispensary in Long Beach and that is defaults a chocolatier last time we took a look at their hundred and eighty milligram mint flavor and today we are taking a look at their 90 milligram of vanilla flavored and I could not be more excited I loved this the first time I had it it might be my favorite edible I've ever had it's the is one of the few things that can hang out with the big big big boys like Kanak oh and Kiva it tasted a [ __ ] incredible it was the best tasting edible I've ever had hands down and it got me blasted at a hundred and eighty milligrams so this is half strength but my tolerance isn't as high before and this is the vanilla flavored so the full say if you have not seen our video before it's a weirdly shaped edible if it's anything like the 180 milligram it's all these trapezoidal shapes and on the back here we've got our little sort of ostentatious description distinctively different captivate your senses with the exquisite bliss of de force a hand crafted from the finest cacao and a premium collection of California cannabis our artisanal chocolates redefine the world of edible confections we are dedicating to using only sustainable and responsibly sourced ingredients good for them I'm very excited and on the back we've got ingredients nutrition facts all that good stuff I do not see their lab testing results but I almost don't care because I know it's really good now a one problem with this is this is crazy expensive I am paying a ridiculous tax at for my dispensary because this one bar I'm not sure if for chewing up 90 milligrams for $25 is insane but I was willing to stomach it just this one time to be a little bit more default say so let's uh stop talking it up and start eating it up and tell you all about the experience also this is the first time you've tuned in to a wheats before our reviews the way they work is I'm gonna eat this entire product not necessarily the whole thing in front of you because I don't want to bore you to death but I will eat the whole thing rest assured and then I will come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how the product is working because that's what you're in it for you know who cares how it tastes tip missus is great but you really just want to know if it gets you high or not so that's why I come back to you guys so opening up here it actually shows you the crazy weird way it is broken down it's 18 different triangles and rectangles those are our shapes oh it's white chocolate this time being vanilla I guess that makes sense sadly I'm not a huge white chocolate fan but still smells great so there we go there is our trapezoidal shapes all weird let's break one off here mmm I don't know like like white mmm I'm not even a fan of white chocolate then this is amazing damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn my god well I don't like it quite as much as the mint but I love mint chocolate and I'm not even a fan I'm not a fan of white chocolate but I still love this if you're a fan of white chocolate and your dispensary carries this run don't walk picks them up that being said don't you just yet pump those brakes give me a couple minutes and I will be back to you guys and by a couple minutes I mean just a couple of seconds and I will come back to you guys to let you know how this bad boy is hitting for me it'll be two hours you just a couple of seconds and I will let you know if this is worthy of the DeVos a name thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit it's so good it is so good tip-off say welcome back to wheat skies it has been two hours since I checked in with you since I have enjoyed immensely enjoyed this difference a chocolaty of vanilla which is really just white chocolate and it was its potency rivals its taste it tasted delicious even for white chocolate as not a white chocolate fan I still loved it and I am hi I don't know what I am 110 something in between I don't care pick your favorite integer that's how high I am my god don't wanna say is they might be they they're the only people that can rival Kanak Oh for me in terms of enjoyment they're amazing I love their stuff if they were only a little bit cheaper I I think they would be my my go-to for for weed purposes for edible purposes my go-to just to share to to enjoy my own I absolutely love these guys I could not enjoy them more and the while I don't like it I did not like it as much as the mint chocolate I still immensely immensely enjoyed this product if you see defaults say that you are dispensary and you don't mind spending a few extra dollars for a premium experience definitely give them the shot guys these are I can't I can't speak highly enough about them that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats before I bounce on out of here I want to share with you a little cherry on top something I like to give to you guys that isn't necessarily a balcan high but you can enjoy it while high or not that doesn't have anything to do related to do with weed necessarily and that this week is a new TV show or another TV show rather and I'm gonna recommend to you Netflix's show love and it's a weird one because the first season is not good there are some pockets of interesting good ideas spread throughout that first season some standout episodes here and there but largely you're gonna hate the characters and and you're gonna find this show kind of more on the irritating side than enjoyable but it all pays off in season 2 season 2 is an incredible experience and I am halfway through season 3 and happy to report that the show is getting even better and in and it is crucially crucial piece of information this is the final season and I love shows that have resolute start to finishes like this so the creator's know exactly to give how to give it a big inning middle and end I think it's a great idea I think all shows should strive to have a series goal a series total number of seasons goal I guess so give love a chance if you can stomach the fact in the first season this is good I understand how hard that is we're in the age of golden the golden era of age of television so giving a show a whole season before it takes office is asking a lot but it really does pay off in the second see in a big big way again that is love available on Netflix thanks for sticking around to this chariot and on top guys and thanks for sticking around to the end of this review we will see you guys on the next review peace", "fwAgLg5Ut6k": "[Music] what's up my true buds we're back with another cannabis edible review if you're not a subscriber hit that button so you can see the new videos we're dropping every single week yeah without further ado the Emerald Skyy licorice as you can see I've had some fun here with the Alpine strawberry there sativa it's 100 milligrams on the pack into 10 pieces and what I really like about this is they're individually wrapped which is great if you want to bring them with you anywhere or on the go because most of the times I'm putting my you know gummies or chocolate in a little container and bringing it with me but these are pre wrapped which is great and I just got in the grape new wore the indica let's see how this does strawberry tasted great I really liked it they got this cool thing here I open it up like I said individually wrapped now the price point is 22 dollars which is a little steep you know I understand that so they taste great the potency is there but the price points a little high but you know sometimes you get what you pay for and that's delicious too the greatly worn off very tasty so yeah pumps you their taste their price point I'd like to see it at 20 maybe even 18 but I think the Kiva's now the keep of chocolate bars now have gone up a price to around the same price point so as you can see I got sativa now that indica I'll Polly getting again because I really like Steve and I didn't like the strawberry and these taste really good too if you want to give these a shot and get $20 off if you want to use these for the first time I'll drop that link below solid and we're back it's been about an hour well actually 50 minutes but anyway it's got me chill definitely feel it potency is there and they're great and the beauty of these like I said they're individually packaged and it's great for micro dose you take ten milligrams cut it in half take five if you have a lower tolerance but let's wrap it up I'm gonna give these 4 out of 5 stars now why is that that's because the potency is great the taste is great but the price points not great hence the 4 out of 5 stars if you want to give these a shot and get $20 off your first order I'll drop an ease coupon code below in the description as always it's good to have you here you're my true buds you", "PFyZsQBADWM": "[Music] we help you guys make sense of your dispensary on this review we are taking a look at another drink from G Pharma labs their G drink brands this is the third fourth with you we've done from G drinks I found them to be all over the map so far actually not all over the map just I found them to be pretty bad to be honest I think I've reviewed two of their 100 milligram drinks and neither of them have done anything for me so this is their 210 milligram line slightly more than twice as powerful and so I'm desperately hoping that this one does something before we have to write off G drinks altogether so again as I said this is 210 milligrams of THC it cost me I believe $18 at my dispensary and I think he had got a discount like 16 maybe so it's uh it's you know about what you would expect maybe even a little bit cheaper than some of the other drinks at that price but let's go ahead and shake well as it advices and give it a taste this is the passionfruit lemonade variety of the G drink it's very very very very yellow oh no I forgot there's a seal technical difficulties oh wait there's a seal there's a ripoff thing guys always inspect the packaging first don't be like me there we go 210 milligram THC passion fruit G drink let's give it a taste ooh [Music] the we taste is more on the back end than the other G drinks not ice which is weird this might be the least we tasting we'd sort of infused taste that I've had from a G drink and it's twice as potent as the other ones that doesn't necessarily bode well the fact that this one tastes better you still do have that really a stringent cannabis aftertaste but none of that like burning taste they had on the front and with the other ones yeah that's not bad um again it does have a canvas taste and it's pretty powerful but it's certainly better than the others which again is a little disconcerting being twice as potent but will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will see you guys in two hours for you it'll just be a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how I'm feeling then thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you guys soon speed-dial welcome back to weeds it's been two hours since I had the G drink two times more THC two hundred and ten milligrams passionfruit lemonade and I gotta say it's a lot better than its a hundred milligram cousins liked it quite a bit more I think it's twice as potent got people waiting for me in the car bout ready ahead into the beach my dogs are waiting for me too don't have a whole lot of time again I think I misspoke I think it's $20 not eighteen I think I got it for eighteen not sixteen I apologize for that 110 calories in this or excuse me 220 220 calories in this entire bottle 110 calories per serving two servings each totally uh happy with this one really glad with happy with way I taste it and happy with the potency as I said definitely feels more than twice as strong as the hundred milligram version that's kind of a redeemer for G drink for me I was ready to write them off now I'm ready to try another 210 milligram drink and that's going to do it for this episode here on weights I will check you guys out on the next review peace", "pvply1CNh9Q": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I know what you're thinking if you're a fan of my videos but wheats you're saying you've already reviewed the strawberry lemon-aid and that is correct but I've only reviewed the 200 milligram variety I have not yet reviewed the 100 milligram bretty in fact I've never reviewed any of the 100 milligrams from cannabis quenchers and the strawberry eliminated was my favorite flavors so far so I thought I'd give it a go if you've ever tuned in two weeks before guys the way our show works is I'm gonna take this edible or drinkable consume a bowl here finish it and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling cuz that's the most important part of any edible review but without further ado let's open this up and give it a smell give it a taste see how it tastes and smells it's got a strong we do der just like the other cannabis quenchers but that's okay because the the taste isn't that bad if it's like the others I assume it should taste even better having less THC in it but let's find out [Music] and yes that is the case he's just like the other one except with a slightly less power potent wheat aftertaste which is great because the that's the worst part about this is the sort of lingering marijuana taste in your mouth is sort of oily weedy taste the initial taste is great it's just that aftertaste can linger a little bit but this is less potent than the 200 milligram variety in terms of that aftertaste so that's something look boy - it's good the gondolier said Strawberry Fields and cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever again don't know what the gondolier has to do with cannabis winter at all can't figure it out but I'm glad he's there to tell me all right guys well I am going to finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats chasm we'll see you soon peace guys half the price half the THC but not half the potency man I gotta say pleasantly surprised with the cannabis quenched your 100 milligrams I am pleasantly stoned for something that it's only advertised as half the strength as it's a hundred milligram brother and I don't feel half as high I feel you know not as high but but certainly not significantly less and the price is uh it so this is all this is I think it might dispensary half the price of the other one I think I would go with this one unless you really really really want to get knocked off your ass or if you have an incredibly high tolerance stick with the two hundred milligrams but I gotta say the hundred milligrams gonna do you the job probably and it's gonna do it at a more affordable price and I really really have enjoyed my reviews with abbis quite sure I will probably try some of their more exotic flavors just as an excuse to keep drinking them Wow yeah a plus um this gets uh well say an a because the the flavor isn't perfect and that's the first time I've ever given anything a letter grade before and probably the last time I ever do that so enjoy that and thank you cannabis quencher this was a great beverage and thank you guys for watching we'll check you on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "PZGm-I6L4HY": "[Music] hi everyone so I've done the lasagna video what you guys have already watched and I've decided to take to try these so the medicated hard candies strawberry-kiwi there are 30 milligrams per cube there's the cubes down there from can abysmal I'm not gonna be taking all four that's way too much THC for me I already have been doing long chokes and that was for my lasagna video if you want to see what was on yes oh that's made go back and watch that one okay so let's see how there there's two left for a rainy day okay so I'm waiting to taste the strawberry or the Kiwi an idea I taste THC tastes weed I don't know why I never taste the the flavoring I just taste the THC always the weed so I'll let these dissolve okay so it's eight thirty eight thirty six right now I'll time it again I will come back when I kicks in in between the next time I come on I'll have different clothes on that's just because I'm taking a shower um yeah I don't taste strawberry Kiwi I just don't but never a problem with cannabis Mo's any of anything of their stuff anything it's all been good so suck on these take a shower come back when this kicks in let you guys know how long it takes to kick in when I'm feeling and everything else okay so it's 953 right now and I took it at 836 so a little over an hour I started feeling this like a couple minutes ago it's it's good there's nothing wrong with it they could take a shower and whatever and that was but you're more like I'm not sleepy and I'm not hungry it's more like relaxed like it's just like such a it's such a good feeling like it's just and I even worried about anything like if you have stuff that you're worried about you wouldn't be worrying about right now cuz it just it's not there to worry about I feel happy but I feel happy cuz I'm relaxed um and I feel that really am i I don't know I'll come closer can you see now if you can see anything my eyes they feel really heavy and like like if a cop came up to me right now he would know by just like putting that yeah yeah the flashlight in my eyes um my hair is driving me like really bad because I don't like I don't like it down but it's still a little damp and that's a whole other story that nobody needs to hear about um okay so it was the medicated candies from Ken abysmal the cubes the taste it said was strawberry Kiwi but it tasted like weed to me like THC like you right the whole time okay so eating cuz I did eat today and I do and drink right it wasn't like the other time yesterday when I did that review when I had nothing in me so even with like had supper and all that stuff so it took a little bit over an hour to kick in I took two cubes so it's 60 milligrams you feel relaxed feel good no anxiety or paranoia you feel it like really heavy in the eyes so that's why I said if a cop stopped me he would know right away that like if he's Sean Sean if he but Dad the flashlight like in my eye whatever eyes he would know just by looking at the eyes no munchies or anything like this is like what I would like to do right now is like if somebody were to tell me like some stories just like if somebody I would just like to listen cuz that's what I feel like doing that's how that's how relax do you feel I was gonna oh I was going to do um the bong toe but that I thought well I should maybe just roll a joint but then like it's this start to kick in so now and the more I'm talking for whatever stupid reason it's kicking in more like it's you know I still feel relaxed though but now I'm still thinking I should roll the joint because why not I think that's what I'll do any of you girls out there that are watching this this would be like a good time to really like like pamper yourself like either do it at home and you know get some really good body cream and whatever or like have somebody drive you to the beauty salon place and get them to you know do your feet and your nails and everything else it would probably feel really good I would imagine so I don't have the patience for that so I'll just use the body cream that's that's good enough but and the guys I think um I think you guys should probably either get your spouse to give you a really good back rub or get your feet massaged if you don't have a spouse or your spouse's no they're not doing it because maybe they just don't want to then go to like one of those massage places and get somebody over there to give you a back massage or a foot massage and it would feel good I'm not doing stages but it's like way too long my mouth that was getting really dry ik and I should have brought up some some water and I didn't so look well I'm not really in a lot bit right now okay so I'm gonna go and feel relaxed some more and then I roll a joint and then come back and just say whatever tell you tell you guys when I'm feeling or when I'm not feeling or maybe I'm still feeling the same who knows okay I'll be back after I do the joint or whatever whatever I say because I don't remember okay so I finished that joint like 10-15 minutes ago so um there was not a need to smoke smoke it because I just feel great but just feel that much better I got the munchies vibe so let's chip cookies and you can't see it but it's milk and that tastes pretty damn good I would say recommend these cubes from can abysmal the hard candies um maybe not for the like the long time smokers that you may need to take like a couple bags but like the average person and like the thirty just the one would like kind of calm you down a bit just sixty would I took um like I can really feel it that's why I didn't want to take more than 60 cuz I did the hundred whining oh that was like it was some strong [ __ ] so 60 is good you feel it food tastes like really good I also can side my back was a little bit sore earlier I don't feel that the foot that's [ __ ] up I got these like I said it's nerve pain I haven't felt that and I was getting like real bad today you feel like pretty good almost like a shirt brought up another cookie but it's okay ouch um I was gonna say if those kind of pains were stopping you from like saying working out or just going for a blocker um going to the gym or whatever I say that if you took one of these cubes you wouldn't be feeling whatever pain it was that you're having I'm working out wasn't gonna make it any worse either like let's just put it that way I would say to do this because you could probably you know you've been getting out going for a walk or something like did I think this is like the stuff you'd want to do that on it's like an abysmal so anyways but [Music] I still feel relaxed but more like you want to get into like clean bed and hair like new sheets put on or whatever it is or and just get comfortable and you can just think about stuff I don't know what stuff but just think or if you didn't want to think thank Charlie's outside the door then close your eyes and go to sleep because that's what the next thing is is closing closing my eyes and going to sleep I think I I don't know what I love it like they look a little red here or something I don't really like looking at my eyes cuz are just oh my god you probably hear something that's just Justin oh yeah look a little bit like a little puffy there I'm not puffy but like well maybe yeah like here they look not puffy but like hi I guess you could say that you could tell it's all in the eyes okay so how do the match hey it's good get it it's like an abysmal it's the medicated hard candies the 30 milligram ones if you feel really good so and pretty soon I'm going to be going to bed so um I think that's everything I think I covered it all I may get something else to eat though cuz everything just tastes good why shouldn't say everything gets all I had was no good cookies in those tasted really good so um my I feel I can barely [ __ ] open them I don't know do they look do they look good I feel like I feel like Michael Madsen Hey oh jeez okay hang on like Michael Madsen they're all squinty anyways [Music] that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "7KjihoRsDHE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this huckleberry hard candy by Bill ferns hard candy company so they actually reached out to me like two days ago and since I'm Sony with this I'm gonna just basically accommodate most most people who do reach out and ask me if I can review so the way I'm doing this as I had the blue raspberry one last night and that was kind of like on me so I don't like blue raspberry or like I don't like raspberry in general like at all so I don't know why I got blue raspberry but if you like raspberry the flavors really good if you don't don't buy it's not you're not gonna like it it's just got that like the raspberry sourness to it and I just like I said it's a personal it's a choice on the taste the hi itself though it was really like it if I was a new if I was a new smoker and I was just getting started this is a perfect way to like get your intro into edibles because one piece is going to be just enough to give you like the feeling that you're after the feeling that most people like associate with edibles but in a mild enough dose that you're still gonna be full control you're not gonna like pass out fall asleep you're not gonna you're not gonna have like a crazy freak out because you had one piece this is a 10 milligram piece of candy so it's not that big if you're more like if you're more of a daily like you smoke every day after works I think then you can go ahead and have two two or two three and then if you really really want to make sure that you're not gonna wake up at all then you brought out four to five but you know like I said it's everyone's personal choice with that I'm going to go ahead and pop this guy open they don't have this score marks which I don't like because I have to like cut it beforehand otherwise I don't like doing that so there's that when you open it at first Wow so here's my package and it's already open I was cool I don't know how that oh yeah it just wasn't sealed all the way that's awesome so yeah this is a huckleberry candy that's really good oh yeah so yeah I definitely shouldn't I got the blue raspberry if I would have got the huckleberry one I probably would eat both last night this is really really good you don't taste any of the marijuana at all yeah Naruto you get a little bit of the tickle that you get in the back of the throat whenever you have like a candy farm edible but that just comes with any of these really good like really really good oh my god yeah definitely if you go with this one the huckleberry if you're gonna buy them this is hands-down you're not gonna have no complaints yeah anyway man I'm really enjoying it so I got a bunch of stuff to finish I gotta go do a bunch of like cooking and a bunch of other stuff for the rest of the day alright so that was the huckleberry bill affords hard candy and yeah like I said this thing's delicious so if you guys get a chance definitely go pick some up and go", "DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video go ahead and give this video a thumbs up subscribe and make sure you turn on your post notifications

interviews and such", "gbdGe8vXGjE": "[Music] good morning friends and welcome to weeds it is time for wake and bake on this marijuana edible review show because we've got my favorite pun name for a breakfast cereal yet Holden Grahams home and Graham's wakin baked from the original baked goods who doesn't love that name holding room it tickles me alright so we've got this is the fourth product we've reviewed from baked goods I think maybe the third third we reviewed cheez-its and or weeds it and baked and lucky farms so this is the third product we'll be reviewing from them the breakfast cereal Golden Grahams with wheat on it now made with rosin concentrate I have no idea what that means and this is a medication not a food keep away from children duh boy alright so let's go ahead and open it and I'll explain to you how our wheat two reviews work if this is the first time you're tuning in so our reviews very briefly the way they work is I'm gonna eat this bag of Golden Grahams maybe not the whole thing in front of you on camera because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll we eat the next thing this whole thing of the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review alright so let's go ahead and open it up take a whip here it smells like Golden Grahams in weed all right so let's holding these grand they're not even that stale tastes like just good old-fashioned Golden Grahams love it alright well if you guys have ever had Golden Grahams before but this slight weed aftertaste because it's not that potent it's really not that bad not that bad at all you can barely taste the weed see if you've ever had Golden Grahams before you're gonna know how this tastes but what you're not gonna know is if it's gonna get you higher or not and for that guys I will be back to you guys in two hours hopefully behind the Hollywood sign knock on wood to let you know how I'm feeling so thank you so much for watching and I will see you guys in just about two hours peace happy birthday America and welcome to weeds welcome back guys it's been two hours since I had the Holden Grahams here although there are no more grams to hold as I finish this bag of grams over two hours at this point I just did a pretty strenuous hike so that knocked some of the high out of me but I would definitely try holding grams again not just because it hasn't an incredibly fun name to say and not because it's just such a good pun because I think it's a pretty good product from baked goods not quite as nice as this view I've got right now but you know a pretty good second-place view so that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies I will be reviewing just a couple more products from the original baked goods coming up so be sure to look forward to those thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace that's pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "GyBydcze4rY": "[Music] welcome two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from banging somebody a company that I loved quite a bit they make chocolate bars and I believe even like vape cartridges but the chocolate bars are my favorite thing that they make so this is the bang fire chocolate it says fire bar extra strong orange and just a little bite so the fire chocolate is with orange and a bit of spice with hybrid streams and it's a hundred and eighty milligrams so if you've never joined us before i wheats what we do here is I take open it up eat the product or eat a portion of it in front of the camera not the whole thing because that's kind of boring and then I come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling so if I can get this guy open we'll go ahead and give it a taste here there we go so here is our bang bar you can see the pop leaf and ass logo all that fun stuff let's give it a taste this is again the bang fire chocolate with orange and a bit of spice can taste the hit of orange and now the spices came there is it's a very mild spice [Music] nice delicious that's great nice little flavor delicious taeseop a very spice well slightly spicy aftertaste but if you like spice with your chocolate and it's delicious so I'm gonna polish this bad boy off and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours because it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes feel that's the most important part so I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how this Bing bar is feeling thanks for watching watching wait so we'll see you guys soon [Music] bang fire chocolate the awkwardly named because it is a orange and a bit of spice bar although the bit of spice I think after consuming the whole thing might be a bit of a fabrication it it was pretty spicy it's mostly an aftertaste but after consuming the whole thing I was I was surprised by by how much spice was in it but I did enjoy it I enjoyed it it's good chocolate the spice was kind of fun the orange was a nice it was a nice sort of cooling addition um and most importantly most importantly I got pretty high from it it's another quality product from bang I enjoyed the taste and like the other 180 milligram products it hits a lot harder than the scant milligrams suggests so if you see one of these and dispensary near you and spicy chocolate sounds appealing definitely definitely grab it this Bing bar which says is a four Times Cannabis Cup champion here on the spine is great love it grab it if you see it near you thank you so much for watching weeds guys we'll check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe

for a reason not just because I don't want to be recording from my kitchen but because I am take a look at just dab bytes in the cookie there M&M a variety special cookie special special cookies I sued 120 milligrams so why am i standing in the middle of the kitchen because I'm looking at a cookie you asked and why do I have this plate well because I'm getting ready to head to this microwave because the bottom of this says heat 16 seconds for ultimate dank and that's exactly what I intend to do so I'm going to go over here keep this bad boy up for that 16 seconds for the ultimate dink my guess is it's really not gonna matter whatsoever it might make a cookie taste a little better but other than that it's not gonna do much also I appreciate the way they spell mmm so as not to get in trouble in their special cookies so on the back we can see that this is nug run only which I still don't really know what that means it says nug run shatter so I assume it's some kind of concentrate perhaps who knows 16 seconds ultimate dink let's give it a try mmm smells dinky ooh comes right apart that is the ultimate dank I don't know what that means actually I guess the cookie probably tastes a little bit better than it whatever it had been cool but not a whole lot better the cookie tastes okay it's not great I don't love it it's not I didn't either but I am so glad I went ahead in experience the ultimate dank what guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this week's review I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling and how this cookie is in it see the eyes then peace ultimate dank howdy chaps just got the munchies for the evening literally flaming hot next but we're not here to talk about munchies we're here to talk about and I still have a wireless air pod in right now we are not talking about munchies we're talking about just dab bytes special cookies M&M it's okay guys it's okay it's not amazing I'm a little high I wish I were a little bit more high than I am look at the eyes pretty white not a lot of red a lot of munchies in there a lot of red in the munchies but not in the eyes uh I definitely go a little high again I wish it were a little bit more the cookie itself was better than average the high is a little less than average so it all comes out in the wash I guess still really not sure what that ultimate Danks all about didn't really get much more dank than I would have guessed so you guys I think I would pass on just a bites if I saw at the dispensary unless it's the only thing there there are other cookies that are in this I think this was just $12 cookie as well which is a little bit on the high end for 120 milligram at a bowl I pass in the gist app bytes and just stick with akarova or a Kanaka or something like that I think you're just gonna get your money more money's worth there than with the just dab bytes cookies so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you so much for watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace that's a pretty good one Thanks hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "yU6dn0ogi3c": "hey everybody it's me freely here and we are back for another episode of their cycle 9 series this time it is episode 3 at day 16 and we're back in that femme G canopy with our growing 4 extracts room everything is looking very luscious and fallen here and I'm very excited at how this is going I think on ma yeah I guess last week's roundtable I predicted that this will be my best gram per watt run probably in the history of my growing career and you know that's a pretty pretty big prediction to make especially this early on but I'm pretty confident at this point and assuming all things go well and we continue to move like we are well I'm pretty excited that we're definitely gonna crush it in here as you can see we've actually actually added a third Center plant here so we've added one more Durbin poison and then again we've already got a Durbin point Durbin poison and Grape Ape that we've already added in here at approximately day six and then at day 13 I believe or an all day 14 we added this one so those are about a week behind the rest and these are about a week behind that and that one is about a week behind those I should say but yeah we are truckin very long and we're pretty close to max capacity and you can probably throw one more in there but I think we'll probably just end up with those three so with the addition of those three plants we are now up to 18 plants in this room with the total of I believe 8 strains right let's see 2 4 6 hey yeah I believe we have eight streets but yeah 50 put our 18 plants we started off with 15 we are at day 16 and as you probably noticed already at this point we have not yet lollipop I know I mentioned doing that at day 14 but unfortunately I had to take off out of town for the last couple days so I kind of missed that and was really rushing to make that happen in the first place so you know I'm fortunate IDing at the lollipop being done at day 14 we are going to do it today probably in the middle of this video and but the reason for that the reason I didn't get to the lollipop being is other than having to go out of town is I did the rest change and with res changes not only do you have to pull these out what I do is I disconnect the two hoses and then I disconnect my two pumps so my recirculating pump and my flood pump and then I pull up my air stone and then I remove everything out and I clean it off and that's a mix of like power washing hand scrubbing soapy water not no bleach or any other chemicals just regular dish soap at this point and tap water so that's how I'm cleaning these roses it takes quite some time just to maneuver everything that's that's a you know task in and of itself but you know scrubbing them down power washing them all and everything you just you know you gotta get it done and it's really they contribute to the overall health of the plants and I guess we can take a look at the res change what we did here so you can kind of see where we're at with our feed chart talked about the first res chains and kind of topping it off and then adding some mammoth pee that was our last videos at adding the Matt Pete so our pH and the last res this current res I should say was 5.8 as I like that's where I left it off at the EC is 1.8 and of course is rest change number to put in about 35 gallons this time whereas before we were like 32 32 and then here's what we added - the Reza's themselves so this is not per litre or per gallon or anything like that I will note it if it is but this is per res so this is per 35 gallons so we did 300 milliliters of cocoa a and B from Kenna nutrients also for Kennan nutrients we use 175 milliliters or isotonic 200 milliliters of boost and 250 ml of years little leaders of Kenna's I'm so I did get the cat as I'm finally in here we were using senses I'm in the past I also upped a little bit cal-mag to 150 milliliters and then Turpin hitter was added as you can see as well as putts well and those are both added at 400 milliliters which is around like 5 milliliters per liter so per gallon I think yeah 500 liters per gallon other and then mammoth pee we put in 35 milliliters so 1 milliliter per gallon so with mammoth pee we're up to one milliliter per gallon blood cell bat guano interpreter we're just dumping quite a bit in there that's probably the max amount of butts while I will use but Turpin ater I may even increase up to 500 milliliters because it says you can go up to 30 milliliters per gallon and let's say we have a full 40 gallon rez what is that like 700 milliliters or something so that's quite a bit especially in each Reds you're looking at using like 3 litres almost per feeding or per about 10 days maybe maybe about 14 days if we went 40 gallons with it but that's a lot it's kind of a big expense and while I may be maybe 30 milliliters isn't necessary but you definitely see the benefit from adding 10 and I'm trying to increase it a little bit more so let's take a look at these grapes real quick and see we have a little sideshow going on here just a little action you know what I'm saying feeling the love in the garden today these great babes are looking fantastic I just posted a picture of these on Instagram and man they're just stacked very nicely some real fat nice crowns and the flower mode is is really like going hard right now take a look at this Durbin poison you can see she's already got the big fat crowns out now too we look back at the flow table that's also doing the same thing and she's also nice and stacked that's that whole tables all flow so that's gonna be a nice thick canopy you can kind of see not only the intensity of this hood like we talked about in Episode one but no it's spectrum difference too you know granted this is all white balance and stuff but it's interesting to see that on video and of course this table we got our big stretches of 24-karat in the back and the cookies and cream now I thought about throwing that second strong that on there and I think at this point I'm gonna decide I'm not going to do that I certainly still could and if I have to yo-yo anything it'll probably only be like maybe maybe up to a dozen but I wouldn't even expect that many like colas over there that I'm gonna have to yo-yo so I'm not too worried about that but if the time comes we can we can do that I'm just gonna let them go right now and I'm liking what I see over here they're just stretching for this metal halide light lean in with it and rocks it way that you can see the the leaves turning kind of facing this way rather than facing up they almost have like a nice little like Benton to them so they're like facing over here and up towards the HPS yeah they're definitely loving it all this all that right there that's gonna be real fat plump buds basically top colas you know any mean but way down the branch foot foot and half down the branch that side lighting is gonna help quite a bit and of course you know side plants are nice if you have the plant out in the room but if you actually have side lighting over the side plants they're basically not even side plants at that point you just got to manually feed them just kind of a pain in the butt because you know I set it up for flood grain so I don't have to do that but you know we're getting quite a bit of a benefit out of these two turbine poisons a great babe on the side so a little extra effort is certainly worth it let's take a look at the temperatures real quick we are slowly rising and it was 77 degrees when we started I I turn off when we do these videos I turn off this exhaust fan I guess it's more of an intake fan over here but that's blowing cool air in from the other room so we're not getting that cool air while I shoot these videos and that's why the temperature does usually rise a few degrees but it was 64 to 77 degrees max in the last 24 hours and you can see that forty seven degree or forty seven percent humidity up to 85% humidity and that's just because this morning our dehumidifier got full and you know it's probably a couple hours before I got to dump it so I just did that now we're back down to that 58% she slowly crap prepped from about 65 or so to that 58 since we started this video or maybe since I started working here I should say I'm gonna go ahead and have a couple sips of my morning coffee here and then I'm gonna get to foliated we got a lot of work to do in here there's gonna be probably at least one bucket full of plants or of leaf material coming out of here certainly could throw those in some smoothies or something like that but I don't think I'll be utilizing them necessarily and maybe miss a girl will be dumb for making a massive smoothie or something but shoot it should just make some salad for lunch how about that oh yeah as you can see there's a lot a lot a lot a lot and someone didn't mention they're like well you know why are you deflating if you're growing or why you lolli popping if you're growing for extracts because you know it might be like lar fee like kind of popcorn e buds down here but they're sort of produce trichomes right yeah absolutely right that's you know it's a good point but I'm not doing a super-high lollipop I think I mention that before normally I'd go like almost all the way up to the scribe net here but I'm really only gonna do like a 15 of maybe 25% and I'm not doing it on these plants I'm just doing it out of the plants they're really just not gonna use the that material at all and it's not gonna get any light it's eventually going to die off so if we have leaves material like you can see already here if we have leaf material dying off that's only going to contribute problems to the plant so I think for the overall health of the plant and the overall efficiency of the plant I think it's a wise idea to do some some defoliating and or lollipop being regardless unless you're just you know that quick and veg and have that small of plants that you know there's no reason to but what I'm doing here even though are we are growing technically for extracts I think it's gonna be a wise idea to take at least 15 to 25% of basically these back rows you know each side that aren't getting a lot of lighting [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys we are back here I am done lolly popping I did a bit of defoliating as well as you saw I didn't take off quite too much but I I did just take off I think just enough to give it a little bit of boost in terms of penetration now I certainly can't get back to like some of this in here so that's pretty much just gonna stay as is but a lot of the kind of central part of the tables and then along the sides here I D foliated just to allow the penetration to get in as well I also cut my thumb pretty good with the scissors and yeah that's always fun don't have too many injuries in the garden to be honest if anything is just gonna be me tripping over stuff or bumping my head on things but those scissors will get you from time to time so let's go ahead and take a look at the undercarriage if you will you definitely see quite the difference here you see on these back ones I took them up a little bit higher than I did on the front and you know I got some of these branches kind of hanging down and the sides in the centre and just you know allowing them to kind of find their space so a couple home might come off still throughout the next week or so but we're pretty much gonna leave what we have on at this point let me go ahead and take a brief step over this table you can see as well quite a bit taken out it's pretty difficult to get back to the especially those flows in the back there but you're really gonna kind of maneuver and just lean into these tables you almost need someone to like be there to hold your belt or something but I'll go ahead and walk you down the tables as well I kind of see there's there's quite a bit here still in terms of foliage I did take up a little bit on the sides here but most of it is still there you can see a lot of a lot of side branching and stuff coming through so there's still plenty of foliage a lot of node sites and this light will be blowing out everything here so it's metal-halide is probably going to be I don't know how to describe it but the best test results I've gotten have been when I run a metal metal halide pretty much throughout the entire flowering cycle not just the last two weeks now of course you know more photons more light that's always a good thing as long as you can keep the environment in check but I think it's you know it's certainly a spectrum thing too so I'm gonna go ahead and move these side plants back here and call it a day I appreciate you guys watching definitely check me out at for girly calm I've got hats and stickers on there plus my feed charts my vapor pressure deficit chart right here that's on there you guys can download print it off throw it in your garden hang it up do whatever you got to do with it maybe save it on your phone or just pull up a website for reference if you're just kind of working in the garden what else Instagram check me out an Instagram you follow me at for Olli lots of bhl kind of related stuff on there I've done a whole lot of BHO videos lately but I've kind of covered everything in terms of especially the equipment I have so I think there's maybe one or two videos I want to kind of complete that series out with but we'll be getting on to rosin pressing here soon and that'll be of course available here on the YouTube channel and maybe parts of it on the Instagram as well but subscribe if you haven't already give it a thumbs up because I can't there's no bending of this thumb right now just got the biggest band neck band aid I could get but thumbs are up throw a comment down below and until probably like maybe we'll get one in around day 21 and try to get back on that like weekly schedule that's seven days schedule but if not you know we'll be in the next five to seven days probably have another update ready for you guys so I guess that's going to be it until next time good luck and grow big", "IcV_HEArfTg": "[Music] welcome to eat sweet sweets well welcome to eat sweet sweets whoa whoa whoa whoa - wheat sweet sweets livestream offline no we are now back we are back no more livestream offline [ __ ] okay welcome the weights guys we are just here to talk about you know some general news to hang

actually I'm starting it on Tuesday I'm leaving Los Angeles going to a wee desert so I've got to start a tolerance break whether I want to or not I'm will be starting a tolerance break um but to answer amateur beatmakers question moderately more nervous but I'm not really a nervous guy I've done public speaking before I've even been a radio DJ once in college DJ and in a past life so talking in front of people is not much of a problem for me I always just imagine everyone in their underwear even when I'm streaming online I just imagine everybody everywhere always in their underwear and it doesn't really help because like I mean people being in their underwear is not that salacious of a thing and I never really understood that this why was that supposed to what up keV gates good to see you bro we're just talking about people in their underwear and why that's supposed to calm nerves I've never quite understood it I guess it's just me it's supposed to break tension you've been here forever and amatuer beatmaker and I appreciate that buddy you're you're one of the oh geez your and I and you will always be remembered that so his cab gates kept gates been around forever as well and I appreciate cab gates too so what are we gonna do we're gonna talk about this hiatus I'm gonna have to go on we might talk a little bit about my trip that I just took to the Getty the Los Angeles is baller-ass art museum that is entirely free outside of parking wonderful experience went to today and then we might also dip into a little cannabis syrup blueberry flavored just as a little little side project before I go on this tolerance break but yes so tolerance break going on a two-week er it's been a long time since I've gone two weeks without smoking without consuming any kind of cannabis but I will be in a part of the country where it is much more frowned upon a place in the country where you can go to jail no no I live in Los Angeles kev gates i well I live in Long Beach but I live in Los Angeles County I am going to East Tennessee a place with very regressive attitudes towards marijuana very very very regressive attitudes oh dude yeah I didn't know you work in LA yeah we

aped before on camera but I don't know if I've ever smoked a bowl I think I might have dabbed on camera once too but not the OG not the traditional method let me just I've got a nice grinder but I'm just gonna tear it up by hand because I won't have to go run and grab it pretty much any way that you can ingest marijuana I do my dad I smoke I vape and of course I eat edibles of course I eat edibles I would go edibles vaping dabbing smoking no smoking dabbing dabbing just it I like it it just does hell in my lungs dude it it it destroys my lungs I've got I thought I had good lungs that

the profession of smoking weed on YouTube I assume they're only maybe three or four people in the world right now who actually successfully have that job I know I don't know this is not my job but it is a hobby it is a hobby I like doing this a lot I like helping people figure out what edibles are worth money you know because I hate going to the dispensary I hate it Haiti one dispensary mine I first started and just like wasting money on edibles that didn't work that's exactly why we came into existence I just got tired of you know trying different edibles and not knowing if they were gonna work and getting a bunch of duds that's where weeds came from and edibles have been my favorite way to ingest since I first started edibles yeah we are growing amateur beatmaker we got on the front

this full-time but that's never gonna happen if I'm being realistic sealed for my protection lean back and enjoy 200 milligrams as related by SC labs we're just gonna do what this recommends here in just sip ever so gently we're not gonna we're not going to do a Lil Wayne style syrup and just guzzle it Coenen seems like a good guy he wanted fire you I'm sure Conan has has hit the pipe more than once he was you know he went to Harvard who who the hell goes our burden doesn't smoke weed no one that's who who smells strong let's go with a nice little sip right from the get-go again this is the 200 milligram blueberry variety oh [ __ ] cheek well I think that is now well shaken well shaking or well shooken well shooken well shook oh my god I can't even rewrite past tense this cab gates surprisingly affordable I got it for 15 bucks but at a discount $2 off $13 at a place in Huntington Beach and I like the syrups quite a bit it's in less calories you don't to eat as much that's one thing that I'm also looking for you taking on this hiatus is not having to eat all these edibles because it did get you know you would think eating like brownies would be good every day but they get tiring after a while eating all that like candy and cookies and cakes and brownies especially ones with weed in them that don't taste that good like I'm looking forward to just you know taking two weeks off from from that which is also why I like the syrups or the smaller edibles recently I think I've sort of been biased in that regard just because you have less that you have to worry about you don't think eat as much or drink as much or do as much I like the drinks - I like the like the lemonade's that canvas quenchers are great if you see those but yes this is affordable 200 milligrams 15 bucks you know discount 13 for a 200 milligram edible is a great deal and and it's rated by the SSC labs the independent body that determines how much THC is actually in something it's an analytics group and it definitely is this will get you super high if if any 200 milligram edible will get you high this one will for short just like a kirova or Kanaka or something I don't think it's quite as good as a Kanak oh but what is but I do enjoy them just because I'm getting a little tired of eating at me after brownie after brownie after brownie how many brownies have I eaten in the past like four months more than probably the past 10 years combined but but not to complain who who can complain about eating brownies I mean that's what a shitty person you'd have to be spoiler alert I'm a shitty person so the getting so a lot of art from the what about the 15th to the 19th century European art which is not my favorite kind of art to be honest I don't really like Renaissance art I don't I I find religious imagery kind of boring which is a lot of that stuff but but but but my partner loves it immensely she's fascinating with that kind of with that period of art and that style of art so I enjoyed going and just sort of vicariously enjoying it with my partner but I really enjoyed their gardens holy [ __ ] they have some fantastic beautiful out to our gardens just stunning setting setting and it's free if you guys ever have the opportunity to go to the Getty in Los Angeles I believe it is one of the if not the largest free museum in the world certainly want to be if not the largest free news the world so that's that's that's worth something but you guys don't care about museums let's take another sip of this cannabis syrup lean back and relax that is so thick ooh blueberry thanks in your tongue it's so thick oh so I've done Kirk saw a Thursday night amazing Dunkirk is incredible it deserves that 95 or 96 it's got on metacritic or 100 or whatever it's got on Rotten Tomatoes for short do not go in with any preconceived notions or expectations would be my advice to you guys if you're gonna go see Dunkirk because it is a sort of unlike anything you've seen before it is chronologically quite tricky the movie is not at all played in any sort of chronological or narrative sense that you would be familiar with they're like three stories in ER spliced and each of those stories not only takes place at a different time but takes place over a different amount of time I think one story is like one day one story is like one week and one story is I can't remember three days or something yeah what about the emoji movie that's gonna be lit I'm a big fan of the [ __ ] emoji I love the [ __ ] emoji don't get me wrong the [ __ ] emoji is one of my favorite things of all time it's it's the only emoji I think I ever really use I'll use the piece emoji too who does not love personified feces oh I understand that sarcasm amateur beat maker totally understand that being said I still totally love this [ __ ] emoji because it's feces I mean this comes from your [ __ ] you [ __ ] this out it's got like corn and like her in it and like you know undigested bits of food and bile and bacteria and it's breeds disease and yet we put a smiley face on it and it's lovely it's a [ __ ] emoji it's great oh my god you met Tom hall and cutie pie Tom Holland what what an adorable little man he is I saw spider-man homecoming as well me me my wife and I saw it and we were delighted by it it was it was quite wonderful spider-man homecoming I would say the second-best spider-man after spider-man - how many spider-man's are there there spider-man one two three amazing spider-man one and two and spider-man homecoming yes spider-man 2 spider-man homecoming that's the way it goes that's the way it goes but Dunkirk is better than all of those the more I think about Dunkirk the more I liked it I did not see it in 70 millimeter huh I think I might have to go back to the theater again and check it out in semi millimeter because I was blown away just in its you know sort of digital presentation just uh-oh it's number one you like it more than spider-man - that's totally fine I can totally totally understand that they're very different movies I think Tom Holland is the best spider-man she's totally totally cool with it I think fillet she has no problems with it she's very encouraging um she does her you know she she's she's a fan she's banned the show even if she is not a co-host but she is ban uh we're not a participant never a participant but uh yes spider-man homecoming I think Tom Hollands the best of all the spider-man's for sure right he's gotta be the best spider-man he's the only funny really the only funny one he's the one who quips he's adorable and this is coming from a straight guy he's so freaking cute I just want to give him a hug I mean he's like a little squeezie bear I just want to uh he's so he's such a great spider-man uh yeah so what are we talking about the Getty I'm getting high already Tom Hollands spider-man Dunkirk syrup all kinds of things we've been talking about everything under the Sun o tolerance brakes as well dudes I have it's probably been the longest I've gone without smoking recently was back at the beginning of April I went about five days without smoking and so now I'm gonna go two weeks which should reset me back down to a pretty low tolerance level actually that's the wonderful thing about weed is if you you will become distant with your subscribers no man I won't ever become distant with you guys I'm I'm a down-to-earth pretty you know down-to-earth cat I'm never well first amateur beat maker I appreciate all your kind words and your your your your gestures of generosity saying that I'm I might make it big but I really appreciate that but not that's never gonna happen but if I were amateur beat maker I never forget the little guys especially amateur beat makers nine three fours oh yeah oh [ __ ] oh my I can't remember I was talking about something about taking a tolerance break yeah that's the great thing about weed is taking tolerance breaks is fantastic you take a tolerance break for like a week and everything's amazing again you know I I'm going to be doing a new set of videos when I get back like oh maybe I'm going to be doing some lower dose edibles on a reset tolerance to see how that goes not a completely reset times because you can never get high again like the first time man I remember getting the first time getting high for me it was a wonderful wonderful experience as it is for most everybody unless it's terrifying I'm sure that happens too okay another sip of this thick thick thick thick syrup down the hatch so keV gates whoa how did you get into being this snapchat guru for for mr. Conan O'Brien how did you land that lucky gig where does he film like Culver City or something Conan O'Brien Studio Oh Burbank Burbank I was just close to Burbank earlier today but now I'm back in Long Beach I'll be soon so guys uh while I'm gone I probably will not be doing a whole lot of uploading of videos I've got a couple more videos in the queue that I'm going to upload over the next couple of days but there will be a big probably swath of time there well there will be no wheats uploads for probably the longest span of time since wheats has started there will be zero uploads also I mentioned this briefly on our last live stream and I'm gonna go and mention it and again on this one to hold myself to this this is there two strains of thoughts on if you want to do something how you should go about doing it should you never tell somebody so that way you just stop talking and actually do something or should you tell somebody you say that you they hold you accountable so you feel like you're held accountable I'm gonna go to the ladder I'm thinking about in a couple of months there's going to be a wheats relaunch basically where I'm going to sort of go back through the vault look at some of the bigger companies that we've looked at that we've reviewed a ton of products from and review start reviewing companies on an individual level like akarova or in infuse creations or Punch bar whomever something like that well continue doing our standard reviews as well as time goes along but but we might do some higher quality videos some bigger videos big scope things and I am getting high-5 guys whoo that kind of a sir Oh still doesn't taste good though leaves them bad taste in them back here throat somebody said something didn't make the bass back of your throat burden and I'm beginning to get that now that that sensation not burning just like a wicked taste right in the back of your throat it's just sort of persistent there with the cannabis syrup blueberry 200 milligrams lean back and relax again I don't want to disparage it because you're not supposed to be doing it the way that I'm doing it you're supposed to be mixing it or you know I also heard somebody says spread it over fruit which seems kind of cool wait a mature Baker why aren't you getting high go get high dude what's wrong are you all right wait don't tell are you in a state where you can't I would be so sad for you if that's the case man I didn't know if that's the if that's what's going on that would be a real American tragedy [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get not getting high at night um let me just check out some of our statistics here make sure all our audio and everything is still going good yeah we're good we're good it would sure be maker still you need to be getting a high um and Kevin gates I still want to know how you got your job with Conan O'Brien uh because that is the coolest thing I think I've ever heard so yeah again going on hiatus two weeks ish give or take a couple days there will be a couple more video uploads between now and then oh just running low but are you are you in a state where it's available or do you have to seek it out in a sort of circumvented way in a less than legal way perhaps because that's that sucks if that's the case hopefully the rest of the country is going to get their [ __ ] together although mr. Jeffrey Beauregard sessions seems be wanting to do just about the opposite of making sure the world gets their [ __ ] together in terms of weed and he seems to be doing everything in his power to get us to regress in terms of marijuana rights which is [ __ ] up [ __ ] you Jeffrey Beauregard sessions what kind of mill name is Beauregard other than awesome I mean if my middle name could be Beauregard I would take it but I would not take my person is Jeffrey [ __ ] Jeffrey but Beauregard damn damn that's a good name Beauregard I've got a shitty name wheats wheat sweet sweets with my nickname as wheats so there we go we wheats excuse me weeds weeds weeds weeds first middle last nickname that's that's my name don't say it too many times in the mirror with the lights off or you will summon me just like Candyman and I will come and blind you or Bloody Mary and whatever Bloody Mary does scratches your face off or something I don't know whatever all those kid games are ah but guys okay so you now know that wheats is going to be taking a two-week hiatus ish break but we will be back with new reviews coming up soon wish me luck on this long and arduous tolerance break and I will see you guys on the other side for a big celebration where we come back and maybe do a big big live stream brownie or something for fun all right guys that's gonna do it for this live stream here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "5ZHAObIjgQM": "yeah they're

i'm back with another one this time um i wanted to go with the concentrate form of papas or i i know you guys probably remember i made the video papa's herb for the eighth i don't remember if i posted it yet but you'll probably see it by the time i post this so these are 0.5 and they've been selling them for 10 bucks at one of my liquid dispensaries so i was like let's go try it out and this was jack hair so let me show you a little bit boom little information boom and let me let me give you a little cool shot [Music] all right so let's go ahead open it up we'll check it out and we'll see how this flows boom there's the seal that's interesting smells oh bam and there it is wow looks very clean very golden this is interesting i can't wait to try very interesting i can't wait to try i should have had this prepared but i'm an idiot so here we are all right oh man it's all a little golden car so it's supposed to be a half gram jack herrera let me see um the potency 85 no cbd but 85 425 milligrams of thc from what they say it's never really what they say so we got to be a little bit weary all right guys let's try it out and see what we think of this jacket here no way no way that's the best tasting um wow i knew i had a good choice with the jack herrera whoa that was almost a blinker by the way i just stopped it right before it blinked whoa whoa whoa whoa wow all i can say is well i was not expecting that i was literally expecting a really bad taste normally with like 10 12 cards you get some really harsh in your throat or hurry carts this is not it this is insane i don't know if it's just this one or the jack hair strain or whatever they had a lot of other ones i'm talking about forbidden fruit skizzle skittles or something with a z of the same brand but those were hybrids and indicas and this was a sativa he said i believe yes of teva so wow okay i'm gonna get right to it i'm not gonna make this video too long taste freaking great it's there 10 out of 10. hi haven't felt it yet it's gonna creep up on me so i'm going to wait on that price 10 bucks 10 out of 10. the company i tried the herb you guys if yeah i haven't posted the the review yet but i swear i'm going to post it before i post this video i'm gonna make sure i do that so you get to see which i'm pretty sure it's up there already but you're gonna get to see the difference in everything um in the two the concentrates from the flowers the flower was okay not in the joint but in the bong after i put i cured it i put it in some glass jar and i let it burp and it opened and it it gave life back to their plant and then i hit in the bottom it was great but the joints were not that great this though i mean boom i i can't it's golden it's golden like i can't even explain how gold it is it's beautiful gold i feel like i hit gold so i i don't even know what to do i want to give it a really high rating in my mind the first number that popped up was a nine nine nine like nine nine and a half i want to give it a 10 but nothing in this world is perfect so i'm gonna go ahead oh my god and i want to give it a 9.5 like literally i'm blown out of my mind but the only way i'll give this a real 9.5 or a 10 star is if i get two or three of these in the bro that are legit taste this good blah blah blah of different kinds not of the same kind of this the same kind of program it tastes the same but we got to try some more so let me rip it again i'm starting to feel the high creep up on me so it's not super strong it's a tv you could tell i could focus like a talk and that's what we want oh my god the taste i can't get the taste taste so clean imagine like train wreck as light possible as possible like some sweet train wreck some really sweet or piney earthy oof it tastes it tastes delicious i don't know i thought these were gonna be trash i'm gonna be 100 honest with you i thought this was going to be horrible i thought i was going to have to filter it through my bone because it's going to be it was going to be harsh on my lungs but it feels smooth going down all right papa zerp you get a nine if i get more of these and they are on hand i'm gonna give them a 9.5 for their little cards for 10 bucks so take that for what it is guys you know it's always hit and miss with things you never know what you're gonna get but for going for they've had these on sale for a while surprise no one's buying them out if i had a hundred bucks i'd go buy me 10 of these right now 5.5 for 10 bucks concentrating it tastes good no don't get me wrong you might get some bad ones you bite a lot but for the most part uh i [ __ ] with this i'm gonna go back and get another one for sure i want to try a different one so nine i'm gonna give you a nine pop reserve for your for your point five concentrates and the funny part is they they changed to a new money system in that place where i went so i was literally there for like 10 10 15 minutes waiting for them to try to figure out to put it in the system so they could sell it to me because it wasn't even in the system apparently so that's funny but i'm happy and they have the herb for 15 bucks they should do package deals the eighth and eighth in the car for like 25 bro like 25 out the door dude that'd be amazing they did get a lot of business or 25 plus tags that's 30 bucks you get them 15 bucks each that's cheap 30 bucks herb and concentrate anyways i'm rambling now thank you guys for watching it's your boy dirty 3.0 and if you've tried this let me know what you think in the comment section like this video comment

medicinal part of these compounds [Music]", "Ycpkm2BjNb8": "oh [ __ ] coding my name agile welcome to dab gaming TV I'm your host vory and in this video I have a very special edible for you guys personal favorite of mine I'm so glad we found a box of these hiding out my work because these things are [ __ ] fire you guys heard a keep Cola yet if you have it keep an eye out for these products look them up check them out I mean look at [ __ ] color come on this sells itself people are like what is that I want to I want to know more about that item all the time all day long so this to the best of my knowledge it's like some sort of like blue cotton candy blue berry something whatever I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] flavor it's supposed to be it's delicious it's really really good you guys a lot of cannabis drinks have a heavy flavor in the background this does not this is super enjoyable I've had their their Cola I've had the root beer I've had the orange cush they're all awesome this is the best one so I bought for today it's like that I just I had to swoop I'm not gonna miss out again and neither are you guys so let's get a little poor upshot here hopefully my camera's gonna focus fire guys be one sec let me check the camera here oh yeah we are in focus and let's go in for this poor now I know it's gonna throw up like a ditch but at the same time I just you know I wanted this shot look at that color that's a [ __ ] trip uh-huh it's just screaming blue right looks like something out of Fallout right let's get you a cola or some [ __ ] it's too cool so my favorite thing about this product is not how it tastes but how it hits it says on the bottle 100 milligrams of THC that's like did I I don't know according to whose standards but this [ __ ] hits like a 150 160 even like a 180 would you know if you guys have had a lot of edibles in the industry right now you know they vary greatly 100 milligrams in one brand is nothing and then 100 milligrams in another is really [ __ ] intense this is one of those heavy ones this is one of this ones it's gonna [ __ ] hit you I'm really really impressed so had one earlier off-camera starting to feel it now we're gonna go ahead and consume two more um um I'm getting set to have a great night yeah so let me finish this one with liquid because I think the cold ones gonna be harder to drink but it'll be more pleasant so trade offs Cheers yeah warmer you definitely taste the canvas isn't it but it's still good it's still really really good Cheers mmm that is the [ __ ] spot oh yeah so I wanted to make this one more of like an official review because of how I feel about this product you guys it's really just super nice it's price point and I don't really want to say well we sell it out if you want to check it out we're on weed maps you know check out some stats a dispensaries would keep colas and it's just one of those things where I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck a lot of canvas drinks are they're pretty expensive this is one of the more affordable ones I found and it just just works and normally doesn't work but it's really enjoyable to consume and that that for me is just a huge win because there's so many edibles out there that you just kind of have to get through or get through it and then it gives you bubbly guts you know like nasty just feeling like it's just too much so much [ __ ] you know it's just cheers to keep Cola you guys are doing it right much respect from dad even just shits fire seriously super fire so you guys can check out the bottle you can see

my name is vory and I'm the dad demon thanks for watching peace [Music] you", "kBK9fpyedaI": "Narrator: With all the\nweed trucks and imagery all over New York these days,\nyou might think to yourself, \"Hey, is marijuana legal now?\" Not quite. What these companies are selling is actually something called CBD. It's found in everything\nfrom lollipops to lattes. And business is booming. CBD products are part of\nwhat is estimated to be a roughly one billion dollar\nindustry in the United States. And it's perfectly legal. So, what does CBD have\nthat marijuana doesn't? Martin Lee: The fact of the matter is we're kind of in the midst\nof a CBD craze right now. Narrator: Martin Lee is the\ndirector of Project CBD, an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics. Lee: CBD stands for cannabidiol. That's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant\ntherapeutic properties, but it's not intoxicating. It doesn't get you high like THC. Narrator: As it happens, not all cannabis plants are created equal. Take a look at these two varieties. One is marijuana, the other is hemp. One gets you high, the other doesn't. The key difference is\nwhat's on the inside. Lee: THC and CBD are the main components of the cannabis plant. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Dave Chappelle: I don't know about y'all, but I can't even move. Narrator: Hemp, on the other hand, has hardly any THC at all. But what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD. Now, CBD won't get you high, but it does have a redeeming\nquality: it's legal. And at least according to the marketing, it has a relaxing effect. So since this stuff is all the rage, let's see how it's made. So, once you have a cannabis\nplant, one simple way to make extract can be\ndone in your own kitchen. Lee: As simple as using\nolive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant or a little bit of the green\nmaterial from the plant. Obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production,\nto be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis. Narrator: But the more common way involves a specialized, complex machine. Lee: One very widespread way is using what's called a\nsupercritical CO2 extraction. It's ground up to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind. And it's poured into vessels, literally, of a supercritical CO2 machine. It will stay in that machine\nfor upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of\nthe extraction process. And ultimately you'll end up with a thick, golden oil that's very waxy in texture. Narrator: You can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons. You can find this oil in a number of different products these days. Lee: It can be administered\nin various different forms. It might be ingested, it\nmight be applied topically. Narrator: They even have CBD\noil products for your pets. I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts\nof CBD-infused products. I tried a CBD matcha\nlatte and a CBD macaroon. These snacks tasted great, and I felt a little more relaxed after, but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head. Scientists are actually\nstill trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body. Lee: So, there really\nis a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work, but we're still really a long\nway of mastering the hows. Narrator: Still, CBD\nmay have more benefits than just a relaxing afternoon. Some initial studies have\nshown that CBD can help with a number of different\nmedical conditions. In fact, in June 2018, the FDA\napproved the first CBD drug, Epidiolex, which is\nused to treat epilepsy. So, who knows? Perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis-decorated\nvans in the future.", "KkvxSq35alo": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where once a week I go out into my Washington State dispensary and I pick up an industrial product something that I probably wouldn't make it home but except this time I probably would make this at home I would name it something different for sure I'm chef Scott and I'm glad you came back if this is the first time you've been here take a look around and potentially subscribe in that button let's down there in the bottom corner you know where today I'm trying a product called hemp crisp protein cookies hemp crisp protein cookies what a catchy name in that ooh five grams of protein Saul you vegans out there tell them where you're getting your [ __ ] protein sorry sorry five grams of protein so if you're a vegan now you can answer where do you get your protein from your hip crisp protein cookies of course this box you recognize this box is similar to the box we had before or the coffee toffee cake bites those really good those were really good and these are from the same Baker Green Revolution they make a lot of other products they go by this TLC terpenes love and cannabinoids cannabinoids these hemp crisp protein cookies each have ten milligrams of THC and ten milligrams of CBD so they are the same kind of makeup as coffee toffee cake bites these hemp crisp cookies are also gluten free and it says right here that they're made in a dedicated gluten-free facility so I expect them to taste like baby powder again I bought these because they were 30% off because they were going to expire tomorrow which was like a week ago all right let's see what they look like let's see what they taste like let's see what we got here one hemp crisp protein cookie I mean don't use the word protein listen Green Revolution are you listening to me don't put the word protein in the title of a delicious cookie that's just dumb it's just dumb oh yeah mmm tastes like the health food store there you go let's read some ingredients for you gluten-free flour blend which is a white rice flour brown rice flour corn starch milk powder tapioca flour potato starch and xanthan gum baking soda salt whey protein crisps whole hemp seed brown cane sugar granulated white sugar butter a milk

crunchy bits of crunchy bits inside hemp seeds and I don't know it might be dust bunnies I'm not sure duncanemma copy didn't do anything for it taste some lightly of baby powder I'm sure that's the gluten free mix 10 milligrams of THC for that I could make something much more delicious we can make something much more delicious than that all right let's see what happens welcome back everybody so yeah look listen these and crisp protein cookies this whole Green Revolution product line is I I have to give it to them they're the flavor though dude look I don't like gluten-free things I know a lot of you do a lot of you need or like or want for any number of reasons and I'm I know I don't like it I don't like it so aside from the flavor for flavor I'm gonna give them a 5 I mean I can eat it but I don't want to go through that to get high or to medicate myself use these have CBD and I'm telling you the full body effect of of consuming THC with CBD through your liver and then your whole system is it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thing so for the Kaseem given him a nine they're great I mean they really work but you have to eat all three did you know 300 had a time so maybe I'd give him an eight let's give him a five for flavor and eight for efficacy and a I have to give these an eight for price because I got them for 30% off so this whole box was only I think was eight bucks at

learned from colorado and ben this is our uh fourth time hosting you which we're really honored and thrilled about he was here one time in person and this is his third time virtually uh and but we are also very lucky to have with us um from pennsylvania's commonwealth prevention alliance the executive director jeff hanley hi jeff hello thank you uh so jeff is going to get us started in just a

we're going to be posting it on our follow-up page which is conversation dot zone slash cannabis um any questions that you submit in the chat box or the q a box during this presentation will not be

but we'll do our best and we're going to have a lot of information on this follow-up page so some of the things that i have posted there already if you go to that page are the ben's program in may was his full powerpoint presentation so you can view that you can also view a couple of other presentations um dr joe garberly from karen treatment center talked about the um the addictive nature of this substance and what some of the fallout has been with the clients or the patients that he's been seeing at karen which is one of the top five rehabs in the country it happens to be right here in um the reading area warnersville pa um his recording of his presentation is on that page as well as another presentation by david fialco who explains what vaping is looking like these days nicotine oils and thc products so that is there and also our youth marijuana prevention project is linked on that page as well because we have a lot of information there also um we have a program coming up that is sponsored by that youth marijuana prevention project funded by montgomery county drug and alcohol program um and uh this is called cannabis that's complicated this will be especially great for parents to attend if you have um a son or daughter who is experimenting or is is deeply into their cannabis use this will be really helpful to you we have a local clinician who's phenomenal he's been a speaker of ours a few times his name is patrick dowling he's a licensed professional counselor and we will also have a young man who is uh in recovery from from cannabis use disorder um and he's going to talk about his experience with high potency thc and his subsequent recovery from that that's on october 27th and you can actually ask judy if you can share the online page the conversation dot zone slash online in the chat box that will take people to learn more about this and register to attend along with other programs we have coming up at the end of this program you'll have an opportunity to take a survey we really appreciate it if you can do that it helps us to know what was working for you what you might have learned wanted to hear more about or what you'd like to hear about in the future from us um so please even if you've been with us before we really appreciate you taking this survey and it'll as i said it'll pop up on your screen as soon as the program ends so uh without further ado i'm gonna get to um uh we're gonna actually introduce jeff hanley first i think it would be nice for us to hear a little bit about where things are in the state of pennsylvania right now so uh i'll stop sharing my screen and uh turn it over to you jeff all right well thank you kim and judy for having me i certainly appreciate it good morning everyone i'm great to see ben again i i started as the executive director of cpa in january of last year and uh lived in mercer county pa for years but also my wife and i spent some time in colorado for a few years and lived there and i heard ben speak in colorado at a school district a few years ago talking about marijuana and the impacts to date in colorado and it was such a great presentation um and it's so nice to to see ben uh here in pennsylvania um providing all of us which with such great information resources so we appreciate it and appreciate um kim and judy everything that you guys are doing too this is fantastic um so i just thought i could just provide really briefly uh just a quick update on some of the current legislation in the state i'll share my screen here real quick and um so everybody can see uh the three bills that are currently in the pennsylvania general assembly um there's senate bill 350 2050 in 1899 um i know that kim is going to share um this and then have this available to everybody um but i think the one thing that i would really encourage is to everybody go to uh these these websites and just take a real quick look at um mostly the bills but also uh what committee they were referred to so you can see here um i linked all these so anybody can go here and just click on the blue shaded areas and and um and pull up those committees so these three bills are in currently in committee which could be good news could be bad news uh the worst thing for a bill in pennsylvania is if committee never acts on it and then it just dies um so i would recommend um checking this out um all three of these committees are a majority owned or majority republican party um so um that is good news in regards to this issue uh what we're hearing um that there are are general assemblies back in session today um so i think or excuse me on monday they go back in session on monday the one thing that i definitely wanted to share at the bottom here so so you can see the session days remaining there are not many session days remaining and in 2020 uh the general assembly must adjourn by midnight of november 30th in even numbered years due to the expiration of terms so uh keep that in mind we know that they can add days to they can have session days to do voting they i can't imagine them accomplishing what they need to accomplish in four days uh through november so i would imagine that we would see a little bit of a change but uh keep that in mind starting monday we're going to hear a lot more about recreational marijuana we are going to hear more about expansion or deregulation of alcohol policy so uh anything that i hear i'll definitely pass on to kim and to everybody else to share but uh i would again just recommend pulling up any of these um committees and um the websites are real well done you can just see who's in charge of each of these committees and and if they're in your area if you know them make a call i i here's the majority the uh the republicans and then the minority of the democrats if you know any of these legislators i would really recommend making a call to their office and and just um talking about the legalization of recreational marijuana and what that would look like for you and your community um so um again those three bills i just wanted to finally say those three bills are are in committee still so they are all an option uh to to be looked at and voted on uh there is a resource from representative wheatley's website that i think kim might share um after the session and it shows the differences of the three bills it does a nice job of doing that um but um there is a lot of other information on that sheet that really isn't factual but you can at least see talking points from the representative standpoint on how they are trying to push this through and all the fact i think he has a a myth or fact page um all of those are very very uh disputable and there are many talking points available for us to sit there and say well ways again marijuana is addictive and here's what that looks like so um i i think only other thing real quick kim is just medical marijuana there's really a lot of discussion on these bills uh if if legalizing recreational marijuana uh were to get out of the committee a bill how would that affect medical marijuana and there's a lot of dispute between republicans and democrats uh republicans want to um they want to make sure that um that they are looking to protect um the medical marijuana current industry and what that looks like so uh it'll be interesting to see how that all kind of plays out and i know ben has talked before about what medical marijuana looks like um in some other states um especially after legalization of recreational has occurred so um a lot will happen next week and and again we'll keep our eyes and ears tuned to it as much as possible and update the field but now is a perfect time now it's a perfect time to look at those committees and and see if there's folks that you know and that you feel really comfortable reaching out to and just sharing your thoughts on on this and what this could look like for you for your community and um just come prepared with a couple talking points and and and you'll be in great shape so we certainly appreciate your advocacy your support and if there's anything that um i can do just please reach out at any time thank you kim thanks so much jeff and we already have one question if there are any bills related to decriminalizing and i think you'll find it i'm just in the process of posting those materials that jeff referenced onto that page but you'll find that that they do some do address it and some do not so i don't know if there's much more we can say about that at this point but okay yeah there's no nothing separate for decriminalization at all um i don't know if i see that happening um but uh you know we're just hearing right now things it doesn't seem like this is set to come out of committee um but it's such strange times strange times with covet that everybody's looking for new revenue and when they start saying new revenue um who knows uh what could possibly happen and we're working with um tobacco control and some looking at what taxes on tobacco could look like what taxes on alcohol could look like to help generate some new revenue so as we look at those numbers and hopefully get them really soon we'll share um so might be an opportunity for new revenue without uh legalizing um substance thank you kim great thank you so much jeff okay and now i will turn it over to the one and only ben court ben are you all set to go are you going to unmute i think so i was just reading lauren's question yeah i need some help on that uh from you guys but i can answer a bit of it i think we'll get to some of these other questions toward the end we'll we'll address these thank you for submitting those please keep keep them coming we'll we'll do our best to get to them i'm really easily distracted so when you send them in um probably if you just sort of see me staring it's not just because it's quarter or seven in the morning here in colorado um it's it's because i'm looking at the questions that came in and i really appreciated um the ones that everybody sent before i'll um answer a few of those throughout and then also go through them um bullet point at the end so my intent right now is to end um at 9 30 your time so we can have a solid 30 minutes for questions and between the four of us do our best to answer or at least find you some resources pardon me to uh to answer those um i'm bummed i'm not out there with you guys right now i was telling jeff you know like when it's not raining and in the fall i think happy valley is going to be one of the prettiest places in the whole country my wife's from central pennsylvania and my little sister's in bucks county and that's why these were so easy to agree to do because i could go stay with my sister and screw around with my nephew but now this damn internet business i don't get to do anything fun um i i'm i'm gonna really try my best not to just do a repeat of um conversations that we've already had however i've gotta lay a little bit of a foundation in the two planning sessions that judy and kim and i have had and trying to figure out what's relevant to this group and what might be purely repetitive i'm going to really try and focus on a couple of specific things which testing and driving because i think as you guys are considering these things legislatively that's incredibly important as well as what we know about mental health and co-occurring issues associated with thc um i i'm also as any of you know who've read anything i've written or seen anything i've done specifically most interested in um the effects that uh the industrialization has on consumption patterns as well as the actual products people are consuming so we're going to discuss those briefly as well um jeff in that paper you had i i honed in right away on the underlying part you had where it said that we there all three bills are encouraging um small business to keep the big players out and so i'm gonna talk to that for a minute too because pennsylvania is not the first to try that um okay so let's see if i can share the screen again for any of you who have been a party uh to stuff that i've done in the past um bear with me on this little bit of a review but we've gotta we gotta have some foundational knowledge but i guarantee it won't be nearly as much as usual all right let's see if i can get this little block thing out of here okay cool um kim can you see my screen okay everything look good looks great sounds great imagine that [Laughter] all right 21st century this is different we were talking about something very very different than what you smoked in the 70s and i i think that one of the most important part parts to doing a responsible job of considering this is that you've got to first recognize that we are not talking about the plant that so many people think that we are talking about um though those days are um they're they've passed into myth and history uh because this is a new school of cannabis and for us especially those of you who are lawmakers those of you who are charged with representing uh us and taking care of us from a policy standpoint you have to understand what it is people are consuming today for um us to do a good job of actually regulating it so the the idea that we have that we know so much about cannabis almost always comes from our own personal experience if not our own personal experience it's second hand experience and i would challenge that other than alcohol cannabis is probably the only substance in this country that everybody either has first or second hand experience with and the vast majority of people do not have first hand experience with it despite what they say most people have never consumed um but everybody knows a guy all you all went to school with somebody um you've got an uncle you've got a sister you've got everybody knows someone who at some point has consumed and the issue that that um that brings up is that we we think that we understand this because we know folks uh who have been exposed to it in the past but here's the reality of it that unless um you have consumed or know very well someone who has consumed commercial products that were produced within the last couple of years um you really your your construct of what this is is incredibly antiquated and that's dangerous if you've got an industry that knows exactly what it is they're selling and what it is they're doing and we don't understand exactly what it is we're regulating and what it is that we are trying to um be responsible with so here's all you gotta do to understand um the situation these next two slides unfortunately these data um have not been continued past 2010 um the 2011 was reporting that we got into 2010 anyway sorry we're not going to see a continuation of these data but this was amazing because it was done at a national level and beginning in 1960 and ending um last measured year 2010 reported 2011 this is the percentage of thc inside of cannabis over 50 years a representative sample from law enforcement seizures from every state and what a couple of things for you to understand that thc is the psychoactive component inside of cannabis if you don't have thc you've got hemp you've got a really interesting textile that incidentally makes the shoes that i'm wearing at the moment and has nothing whatsoever to do with getting high uh you you you've got a plant that's used to build and do things with with the thc you get um the the high so the more thc a little oversimplified here but the more thc you've got in it um the higher somebody's going to be able to get okay so when we talk about cannabis traditionally and something that i think is exceptionally important for you to understand especially as you're having conversations with people who like to cite the history of it is that when we began measuring this at um university in mississippi in 1960 we see what really naturally occurs inside the cannabis and what goes uh you know we've seen this uh there's actually been mummified cannabis plants that we found that we can test inside of tombs in asia and africa and we know that what naturally occurs inside of cannabis is somewhere between a point two and a point five percent thc that is the substance that humankind has interacted with for millennium of course there were some exceptions with higher percentages particularly around some religious traditions but you certainly weren't seeing anything more than maybe two or three percent thc globally anywhere in the world um until the 1970s so what ended up happening and since this is america it's fun knowing the history and learning a little we can actually kind of tell you what led to this spike um and then the rest of this is just good um uh gardening this is just folks who know how to um cultivate stronger and stronger and stronger because in this country we like to get high so here's the this is the most important thing i think i'm going to show you uh today is this next slide so um set the coffee down lean in get ready to take a picture of this one because th this is to me sort of what it's all about so i'm showing you 50 years in increments of 2.5 percent so over the past 50 years this is how much it's grown i am adding colorado to that in the blue and unfortunately these data will never be continued either um the whistleblower who came out with all of them anyway long story what you see here is the transformation of a plant into a commercialized drug and as we talk and discuss the importance of understanding and regulating we must move away from the hyperbole that describes this simply as a plant because it is no longer a plant this is a manufactured substance this isn't grown outside by farmers this is produced indoors by chemists with the intent of getting as much thc into a product as you can to sell for as cheaply as you possibly can because the math is really really simple um colorado has relatively good data we don't have anything after um sales gear 2018 but in sales year 2018 of all of the weed thc that we sold in colorado which was a lot um almost 80 of all of the thc was purchased by 20 of the consumers meaning that those who consume on average eight times daily are the ones who are driving eighty percent of this market they want stronger they don't just want stronger they need stronger because the way the tolerance works with this very very different than alcohol and opiates tolerance to thc is a different thing so what you see and what happens is that that fringe uh the smaller group of people who are absolutely buying and consuming the most are the ones who drive it and that's why you get pushing potencies like this because it's just driven by a market need so again i would challenge um the the idea that this is the same thing that humankind has consumed and interacted with for millennium it absolutely is not it has gone from a plant to a drug when we moved away from good gardening to good chemistry uh and the chemistry is even better now and and i thought it was nice that uh there there's an intent to try and keep it small and keep the big industries out but that will not happen uh you might figure out keeping them out for a little bit but the the reality is that the chemists from here the chemist from california the the folks with the phds who are actually manipulating this plant to get that amount of thc into it they're going to be in pennsylvania in a minute the same way they went to canada the same way they went to washington and oregon and there's um there is a multi-billion dollar a lot of different ways to count how much it is but probably around a 20 billion dollar industry behind this movement it's not so much a movement as it is a marketing campaign at this point and you had better believe that they are not going to let a state the size of pennsylvania allow the mom and pops to make the money from that mom and pops might make it for a couple of months but uh give it a minute med men will be in town like they are everywhere next most important thing that i decided you had to understand um is that the dsm which is the manual that uh mental health professionals and psychiatrists use to diagnose um it's where you get the icd code so that we can you know bill insurance and all of this kind of business um the last version of it the five which came out i think it's been three years now somebody will correct me on that if i'm not wrong um if i'm wrong included objective diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal and um the reason why this is so so significant is that the idea of physical withdrawal from thc um up until the last couple of years was like like a funny joke like they would be like oh i must be withdrawing because i stopped laughing at spongebob like i must be withdrawing because i haven't bought um cheetos in the last two weeks like it cannabis withdrawal from a physical standpoint wasn't really a thing but in the last couple of years it has become a thing um so my actual job now um and the reason why i'm up in the mountains i took over a small men's only treatment program up here called the foundry um and i said at the ceo desk for it and while our numbers aren't big we work with 25 or 30 guys at a time um we're on the absolute front lines of this and we see it just like everybody in my field is saying if you ask man ask your colleagues and friends in pennsylvania what they're saying with it the the physical withdrawn the need to treat that physical withdrawal from thc is um is one of the best problems that we're saying over the last couple of years and there's not um there are no pharmacologic interventions for it it's not like we've got [Music] drugs to help people come off of this it's also something that's so little is known about that it's not often being treated adequately um and i'll tell you that it's a very very real thing and it's a big deal and it's also important for those of you who work in my field i believe that there are some of you on here fellow um mental health uh professionals and prevention folks to understand that as somebody is going through this for the i mean really out to about 16 days with a resurgence it seems like um 10 to 14 days or so they can be getting their asses kicked physically they can be really going through some hard stuff and struggling and so for up for us i think it's part of our responsibility to um learn more about this and understand the ways that we can treat it but but the simple fact that today we are categorizing thc uh with objective criteria for physical withdrawal should show you how very much um this drug has changed because it wasn't so um the most important factors when we are discussing dependence and now we're going to we're going to shift into diagnosable substance use disorder or cannabis use disorder are these age of onset frequency of use and thc potency and what we have found is is that so when we consider thc an addiction um it is very real absolutely objectively quantifiable and it's not easy to treat um i'm not going to go into the details of how this is quantified because i've done that in a lot a lot of different places but when you hear the marijuana is not addictive sort of a thing um that's that's uh old school that's somebody who hasn't stayed up on anything or it's somebody who's trying to manipulate the facts of it because objectively speaking without bias and without the politics of it all um thc absolutely is addictive and i mean to the point where where we get physical dependence on it uh the reason one of the reasons why it's not easy to treat is because you have people saying stuff like that it's not addictive nobody's ever died from it and i'll tell you though again those of you who work inside of my field um consider the microaggressions that exist in there when we get somebody into treatment we say something like oh it's just weed well you don't need a detox it's it's only that it's it's very difficult for us to treat i think because we bring so much bias into it and if you can imagine the social fallout that there is for somebody who raises their hand and said i need treatment for my thc addiction if somebody says i gotta i gotta kick heroin it's time for me to get off meth i need to stop drinking everybody rallies around them and supports them since a lot of the times our communities are made up of other people who consume thc when we say guys i think i need to stop thc the number of hurdles that they have had to cross and jump over to get there a lot of the times is pretty profound like it takes a lot of effort to stick with it as everybody's gonna push back on it with these totally antiquated ideas that it's um uh it's not addictive i think these probably have to be the same folks who are saying um it's not warming up and uh cobit's just gonna go away and everything's awesome there are people who just aren't really paying super close attention to what's actually happening it often requires much longer stays in treatment as well as antipsychotic medications to balance the psychosis that happens that we'll discuss a little bit in the beginning and the trick with it requiring longer stays is that as insurers i'm sure they know exactly what's happening but you know and insurers don't really like paying for things what you see is big big pushback from insurance companies on actually staying in treatment for as long as it takes um we had a case recently where it was um six weeks uh before the young man's psychotic symptoms actually died down to a point where we could start to to treat and of course at that point insurance had long since stopped paying and um we were just floating them um he was staying here and a big part of it was because i was really curious personally about how long it would take for him to kind of come back to earth and it was a pretty beautiful thing to see when it happened but um it takes a longer time to treat him so traditional addiction rates to thc were around 10 uh and this this is what we used up until about 2012 and in 2012 um there were some uh studies that would suggest that it was depending on those um those uh um factors i showed you before onset frequency and potency that would be up to about fifteen percent and in a huge meta study just published this month um we see that those are actually reaching as high as 30 percent as a result of the increased potency so a rate of 30 percent uh an addiction rate of 30 percent to a substance is pretty significant so that means that um a person will meet the objective diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder about a third of everybody who is exposed um can get to that point again this is this is why you've gotta stop thinking about it is the cheech and chong plant and the giant you know two foot long doobie that somebody's rolling up and the smoke all day and get a little hungry sort of a thing um were it still that substance you absolutely would not see this so a lot of these uh patients with a substance use disorder in cannabis require physical detox as well as medical intervention and the medical intervention um at this point at least uh revolves mostly around antipsychotic medications um because there's a difference so a lot of folks who come in to get treated for thc are experiencing psychosis um and what you've got to do which we'll talk about in a minute and what you've got to do is determine um and figure out if you're looking at a psychotic episode or a psychotic break a psychotic episode um you come back from a psychotic break some kind of shifts up here so a lot of the times we find ourselves administering short-term antipsychotic drugs in order to get to a point where we can can actually treat the patient and again i i i fully recognize that when you talk about this stuff and if we had longer i would have done a much better job of dancing and and uh easing into it so you wouldn't think i was some crazy reefer madness kind of dude but we just don't have time for it the the reality is that guys i'm a recovering drug addict raising from thc was a big part of it 24 years so we're raising three kids in public school in the weed capital of the country who runs an addiction treatment program here i got a pretty damn good viewpoint and i recognize that some of this might be hard for people to hear that no no you can't require physical detox no no they're not actually taking antipsychotics yes you are and and yes that's exactly what we are doing and um i i hope that a lot of us can shed our own bias and our own desires for this to be a quick fix and a panacea and something that'll make everything work to recognize that what's actually happening here is different than what we thought so here's what um a commercialized market looks like and again i don't have time to go into the economics of it just brief so you understand the vast majority of thc is purchased by the most dedicated consumers the people who use multiple times daily and because of the way the thc um binds and in the way that your tolerance grows to it you you just gotta keep getting it stronger to get the same effect so remember the couple of slides ago where i told you that what naturally occurs and up until um a couple of decades ago was 0.2 to 0.5 percent thc um we're seeing products right now that are pretty much pure thc 99.99 thc which is um remarkable for a lot of reasons but the the one of the ones i'd like to point out to you is that no recreational state no matter how hard they've tried has ever limited potency we attempted in colorado two years later when a lot of people here felt buyers remorse a big group of folks got together and they tried to uh impose a limit of 16 thc in colorado and the reason why they used 16 was um it's the best information that we have um about the the effects of high potency thc is capped out at about 16 percent um we really have no idea what um 20 thc is doing to the human brain and body from a scientific standpoint i can tell you um anecdotally and what we see but we we tried to stop it at 16 percent here in colorado and um you saw an industry unite uh like nothing i'd ever seen before and they said we'll kill the market it'll kill the concentrate market um you can't do that you don't understand what you're doing the problem is they uh this this industry banks on the fact that we don't understand what they are doing and what they are doing like any other industry that has addictive potential anyone food opiates alcohol porn it doesn't matter every single one of those industries has to drive user engagement and the way that the cannabis industry drives user engagement is by getting more people dependent on it and the higher the thc potency the more dependent the other things that matter the most um certainly when a person begins consuming it and they're going to say the same stuff that the tobacco industry said because they're saying here in colorado oh we'd never want a kid to get high oh good god we'd never want a kid to get high and i i've got literally over 600 photographs just of the most egregious clear dedicated marketing to children using cartoon characters you know using stuff that would make joe camel um turn over in in his grave spuds mckenzie look like nothing because we don't recognize that this is what they're trying to do trying to drive use so that they can make more money one of the things i love about um kim and judy and and the entire organization here is the fan is the focus that we have on children and the importance that you guys see in the developing young brain and i think it's beautiful and i think um if you guys do get an established cannabis industry inside of pennsylvania you might have some friends there because they absolutely also have a focus on youth and on the developing young brain because that is how they drive profits that and creating stuff like this 99.9 thc so what we all have these ideas about the you know mom and pop kind of farm um farm-to-table cannabis and everything this is what's really going on behind the scenes drive potency drive use drive early engagement and so here we are thinking well we're going to regulate this thing and we're going to teach people how to do it we're going to wait because because when i was a kid this was how we drove around and meanwhile the industry is like awesome pops you go ahead and figure out building a regulatory infrastructure for your freaking model t well we're ripping around in this thing and let's see who comes out with the money at the end of it all because weed isn't weed anymore it's not this this bud that you see here it's um wax and it's uh butter and it's chatter um the and again we we don't have uh i don't have the time to to get into all of this but what you've got to understand is that the lion's share of the market the most money in colorado is being spent on concentrates these are concentrates this is what the cannabis market in colorado looks like it's not 60 year olds buying buds it's 21 year olds buying this and sharing it with other young people it this is a concentrate so concentrated cannabis and you'll see your um proposed bills all have language that includes this in it this is what the commercial thc market looks like it's not plants and buds and pretty things it's this because this is how you get higher thc potency into a product so that folks can um overcome the the tolerance that they've built up and and here's um really the future of commercialized thc markets a thing called a distillate um this is the this is what um our market is sort of centered around in colorado when you go to the dispensaries it's on counters i go to lots of dispensaries um this so that's that's what's being sold as weed and i'd like everybody just to take a second and look at that and shake your head and say that's not weed no it's not it's a concentrated thc that started looking like this uh this was before it was cooled that's great distillate water clear no alchemy just pure science can you imagine the scientific acumen it must take to go from a green organic material to this and then we package it up and we sell it like that it's not weed but it's absolutely being sold as and this is the majority of our the market in colorado there you think you'd ever see the day um that's a commercialized cannabis market this this is all thc and then vaping you guys have better things about this uh i'm not going to cover it edibles are a huge problem the issue with them is that you have multiple servings and you guys will too multiple servings inside of um one package and because of the uh okay so there's no fda oversight nobody is overseeing this at the federal level so that means every state has to manage um all of these um food products and topical products and things which is definitely something that states are not used to doing because it's fda's job but since this is federally illegal fda can't have anything to do with it so what is ended up happening is the um the edible market is exploded uh and to include things like this if you so edibles we traditionally thought of as like baking an organic material into a brownie or something like that here here's an edible um that's infused with a distillate so if you remember the distillate what i was what i was showing you that clear liquid that's 99.9 percent purity it's not just thc it's um isolated at the submolecular level to pull out just the delta 9 thc so now we have and because we do it by weight not by potency you've got these so this is a hundred milligrams right here you can see it even though colorado law says that you can only have 10 milligrams per serving what the package for this will say is that you're to separate each one of those into tents before consuming and again it's not um then eating 10 milligrams of organic material it's 10 milligrams of distillate here's um a granola what do you call like a graham cracker size thing with a thousand milligrams hundred legal servings and it'll say on it separate into one hundreds uh the problem is that young people just don't do that but does a nice job of getting them to be returning dedicated customers look these have a thousand milligrams of sodas cake pops chocolate bars this industry is insidious and this industry doesn't have regulatory bounds and nobody understands it well enough to actually go in and regulate it and say hang on what exactly is in this poo tang pi cannabis that's being sold as medical um how is it being how are we assured that it is not full of things that i shouldn't have in it how are we assured that it actually has the potency it says that it does and that we're so far behind in our understanding of it they're just kind of doing what they want so ketchup and hot sauce coffee k-cup coffee thc infused lemonade ice cream and candies granola bars thc infused nasal mist topical intoxicating thc thc um pills so you can swallow and get high thc infused lollipops thc teas little uh gummies there's things made to look exactly like other candies obviously with 100 milligrams of thc in it pot rocks it's not a joke that's a real thing again very clearly not being marketed to the 40 year old responsible user because i'm not psyched on sour apple pot rocks i think my kids would be and they know that there's uh keef cola makes a soda with 350 milligrams of thc in it you can actually get for less than that now um and a little warning label on it that says separate it into 30 fifths uh 35 servings and that is what that little cap is right there 135th so go ahead and put keith cola into youtube tonight and see how many of those kids are separating it in the 35th if you keep up with rap culture at all here's your pre-made thc syrup and i thought that was pretty incredible there's thc water seems to me to be the apex of things the point being once you've got this commercial market in place everything that can be put into your body is going to be made with thc in it that means you know how are you going to tell if somebody's eating a regular candy bar or a 350 milligram thc candy bar um the liquid thc if the five hour energy they just took is five hour energy or if it's actually thc there's a intoxicating underarm applying thc here's thc breast spray the list goes on and on and on let's move to mental health consequences associated with casual use so casual use and uh for this particular incident we're looking at uh 10 to 12 percent thc 10 to 12 percent and we know the higher the thc the higher these numbers and this is the part of this that i just listen if we decide to move down this path in this country fine and it's what i said in my book i think that there are probably better things to spend our time and treasure on but if this is what we decide that we want to do in this country fine we just have to be honest about the risks associated with because it's being sold all the time as this perfect there's no issue everything's great um cow why didn't we think of this 50 years ago sort of a thing when that's not honest uh because the the mental health implications that are associated with this are fairly significant and they're things that every single day of the week um i'm seeing and working with and to to you know write this off is to write off the suffering of a lot of people with significant mental health issues that are either complicated or created by their thc consumption so the risk of depression is 1.4 times increased with casual use we do not have any idea if that is causal so do more people consume because they have a depressive disorder or do you get a depressive disorder when you consume more don't know the answer to that we know that acute anxiety is causal causal so we know that uh in in the higher the potency it would seem the more acute or the the louder the acute anxiety is so we know that um somebody who tends to be anxious to begin with when they are consuming these higher potency and higher potency here i mean i'm talking about like 10 and certainly it escalates and escalates from there um that it causes acute anxiety there is an increased risk of anxiety disorders we don't yet know if it's causal um we'll we'll see what happens with that one i think kind of uh common sense is going to tell us something there but we'll wait for the science to hash that one out you have considerably worsened outcomes in treating bipolar disorder um a pretty brilliant psychiatrist who i know um who spent a lot of time considering and thinking about this said uh what what i think it has to be is that um this higher potency stuff is kind of always changing the chemistry of the brain in unpredictable ways and so it makes it very difficult for us to keep up with um balancing medications for it and then the risk of attempted suicide requiring hospitalizations which is sort of the big measuring factor because we can ask a person questions there we know it was um a very serious attempt but they're uh not deceased so we can probe into it a little bit the risk of suicides requiring hospitalization is twice as likely and somebody who consumes casually which should sort of be the end of it if you look at colorado's numbers this is i wish everybody who was thinking about this would do if you just look at colorado's numbers causation correlation i don't know and we will never know but we have never recorded higher teen suicide rates in colorado than we have the last six years we have never recorded higher overdose rates from opiates than we have the last five years so this isn't this thing that you're going to introduce and everything's going to get fixed use of any cannabis at all is associated with one and a half time increased risk in psychosis so psychosis is kind of this big generic word for um the pejorative would be crazy but for mental illness and it can show up in a lot of different ways and regular use so uh twice a week would be associated with a twofold increased risk of psychosis and again here when when we took when if you look at this third bullet point when we're talking about high potency i want you to keep in mind that we were talking about a 12 so higher potency cannabis more frequent use and genetic susceptibility so the presence of those can increase your risk of psychosis by eight fold listen if if there was like a chemical that was found inside of this coffee cup that i'm drinking from right now that did one fifth of this there would be a ban on it tomorrow an absolute across the board band until we figured out what it was because um we finally are starting to wise up and care about mental health um in this country a little bit and um to have setbacks like this is pretty ridiculous so any use before the age of 18 sees a two and a half time increase risk in the diagnosis of schizophrenia that risk increases as dosage increases so probably pretty causal so here are the acute physical health and i'm going to just run through these because i want to talk about the testing impaired memory motor coordination react time singular focus reduction and perceptual accuracy those are all very very very important skills when it comes to driving and if you you look into so everybody keeps good numbers on this the rocky mountain hydra report high intensity drug trafficking area has some great numbers but um so so do all of the um departments of transportation and all legalized states and the uh traffic safety institute um the the rate of our um fatal crashes where the driver is positive for thc is you know it's a line on the graph that just goes straight up um these are things these are skills that you need for driving and working so here's the issue with it uh chronic use for pregnancy i'm sorry but i have to run through it because i want to make sure we get our time going here so here's the testing and driving you cannot measure impairment any other way than with a dre a drug recognition expert that's a specially trained member of law enforcement who's going to put somebody through about half an hour's worth of um tests physical tests to just to see if they're intoxicated or not because um thc is fat soluble we have seen it stay measurably in a person's system for up to 72 days with marilyn heuses look at a beautiful wonderful elegant study um so we also have found as you're seeing people say things like well we'll be able to test this way and don't worry this product is going to come out that law enforcement will be able to do a roadside the method of ingestion makes that whole thing moot we can tell when somebody has smoked but as you saw a tiny little sample of there's so many ways to consume that aren't smoking where it ends with us is that the presence of thc inside of somebody's system be that urine hair uh blood the presence of thc does not indicate intoxication and colorado has decided on five nanograms per milliliter is our benchmark for sobriety or 0.08 equivalent if you will less than five nanograms per milliliter does not indicate sobriety so you may ask okay well if if under five nanograms doesn't indicate sobriety and over five nanograms doesn't indicate intoxication how do you determine intoxication back to the first bullet point you cannot measure intoxication other than done by a dre so you could have a person who consumes on friday night goes into work on monday alongside somebody who was consuming the entire way into work that day or who ate an edible and they could be involved in a workplace accident both of them are going to test the same depending on the way that they test and how things go one of them clearly intoxicated one of them not but as soon as you change the laws of the state where it's a person's right to have thc inside of their system um everything changes and i will tell you guys the uh maybe it's because it's early and i'm um tired and i just saw how old i look in the mirror versus how young i looked in that picture maybe there's just not a lot of time anymore i'll tell you that until we have a reliable and responsible way of measuring intoxication at the roadside anybody who moves forward with this this is checking a box being okay with more intoxicated driving and i really don't think that in the 21st century i have to make much of a case about why driving under the influence isn't a good idea here are a couple of places to look please um i'm a board member with these guys sam smart approaches to marijuana much more politically minded um more politically minded than i am but uh good place to start if you're interested in getting involved nida the national institute for drug abuse samhsa smart colorado is a group of moms basically that um personifies the buyer's remorse um who have joined together to try and tell other people what's going on and then just make sure that you use a critical eye when you're looking i subscribe to probably every single pro cannabis newsletter and website on the planet just so i can keep up with things and just remember that the more money is involved in something on either side uh the more apt people are to sort of twist it to what they want to do there's a copy of my book it should be your barnes and noble um amazon wherever i don't think it's a particularly good book it's not high art um but uh i think there's some helpful information in it 7 30 nailed it questions awesome job ben you did it thank you so much great stuff um we have some really great questions um i want to start with a comment though that's um quite heartbreaking and i want to thank this person for sharing this this person said thank you so much for telling the truth about marijuana our son died by suicide in april he had marijuana induced psychosis there was no convincing him that marijuana was the problem and the treatment center that he attended failed to deal with the root issue even though we shared with the physician and social worker that we could see that marijuana abuse and psychosis that company were the problem and i'll just say that you know i um i'm assertive judy and i are both certified family recovery specialists i i facilitate a support group every week i've been doing that for nine years the support group thing ten years really um a week doesn't go by that somebody isn't lamenting the the fallout certainly not always to this extreme and again we're so sorry for your loss um but it is it is just um infuriating when i hear people say nobody ever died from overdosing on marijuana well first of all an an overdose does not necessarily mean death and overdose means toxicity you can overdose from a lot of things i can overdose on aspirin you know so that doesn't mean you're going to die but it's certainly what i'm really seeing is the the loss of motivation and the loss of connection to the family the isolation i mean our kids do not need to be isolating more than they already have to right now social media is contributing to that let's not add something that that one of the number one side effects of using this substance is lack of motivation apathy that sort of thing so um i just want to say this is a truly serious topic and when people say you know it's not fair to to incarcerate someone of course we agree with that but it's also not fair to minimize the effects that this has on a young person that's the end of my speech about that but i really want to thank this person for sharing that well said and um cannabis induced psychosis is a very very real thing and a very loud problem and i'm so sorry um we see it every day here too i'm so sorry kim i can go through these questions the pre questions that you want or we can run through the ones i've tried to answer some of them how do you want to do it well let me just say that that um a question that came up a lot is how do we help our community members understand this share this video this if if this doesn't help explain the the potential you know challenges i don't know what will so please share this video um and i did load ben's powerpoint on that page that i mentioned the video will be there later tons of resources are there and for for folks that are asking about parenting and the challenges of convincing our our sons and daughters um and by the way judy and i both had those conversations several years ago with our sons um who are thankfully in recovery today but um that program on october 27th is going to address a lot of that that is going to be very specifically about parenting so that's on our online page so again check that out but ben i think if you want to pick some of those um advanced questions that you'd like to address go right ahead so let me run through the advanced ones because um you guys sent those in and then i'm looking at the other ones i'll get to those as well um the how can communities be helped to understand that marijuana use can be harmful i think that the most important thing is that we all just keep having honest conversations and then we not shy away from um the pushback that you're gonna get with folks because a lot of the times especially somebody who the the circles that i roll in and travel in um tend to be a little bit more on the left leaning side most of the time when you bring this up you know folks like whoa hold on what are you talking about just um be willing to have the awkward and uncomfortable conversations and know that if you got the facts behind you let the pundits be the pundits and let the the people who are just trying to profit off of this uh do and say their thing i think it's our job to move this conversation into a more intelligent place so how how can you help and especially about seeking treatment so this is listen not all treatment is created equal in another life i spent a lot of time and then still in some ways continue to spend a lot of time making sure that people in my industry are actually doing a good job with it look look into the program really well ask him some hard questions and and here's the bottom line um this is something that uh for me it's 12-step work um i'll put my email address inside one of these things if you've got questions specific questions about how to help a kid um i i would be more than happy to either walk through that with you or to put you in touch with somebody who can help with it because um that's the way we stay sober is doing those things i thought this was a wonderful question how do i balance my support for decriminalization of cannabis and my concern that the damage that frequently being high has on people i support the decriminalization of cannabis i i have written this for for years for for pushing a decade now that i don't see any issue at all with decriminalisation decriminalizing possession and realistically um we had de facto decriminalization in colorado prior to this whole like all these people were arrested sort of a thing um they were fined i mean anything under two ounces of cannabis in colorado was a hundred dollar fine and most of the time it was dismissed like you would a traffic thing but that's what they were calling arrests so i don't think that there is any problem at all with supporting decriminalization of a thing and saying no to the industrialization of it this is where i think the vernacular gets super duper important when everybody says we want to legalize um yeah you don't uh most of the politicians who are involved in this thing when uh the when decriminalization comes up their lobbyists push back hard and they say well no decriminalization is not really a solution the only solution is you know letting us make hundreds of millions of dollars in doing it and and that's just uh ridiculous the efficacy of this drug and behavioral health treatment per diagnosis so um pretty much every behavioral health you could condition you can think of um uh ptsd uh adhd and then certainly the more severe ones bipolar disorder depressive disorder anxiety thc is contraindicated for the use with and we certainly would not some want somebody using it um you know like freely like take as much of this uh as often as you want for as long as you want it would be done in a physician-monitored uh way with an actual prescribable medication one of the big things that people miss is that um one cannot prescribe a marijuana it can't be done it's a schedule one controlled substance the way that your law is written um allows a physician to recommend the use of but you can't prescribe that somebody smoke a plant because that's not how it works in this country things go through fda approval and fortunately like thank god because some of them are doing some amazing things we have some fda approved cannabis cannabis-based medications because there absolutely is medicine inside of the cannabis plant absolutely there is the trick is to separate it out and to give it to folks effectively but um to use smoked cannabis is an intervention for behavioral health issues is a no-no um is it possible to help our adult kids understand how weed and other substances is negatively affecting their lives yeah absolutely it is everything is possible uh and and i think the the first thing that we have to do is to get a little bit educated on it um i really i for the most part was tired of traveling and wanted to be with my kids and that's why i wrote that book and i have a chapter in there called something of that effect you know how to argue with a 17 year old or how to talk to your kids or something like that um there are lots of effective ways to do it and i'll tell you that the the first recommendation that i'll give you is don't come into it angrily don't walk into that conversation when things are bad don't walk away from something like this with information that becomes weaponized and yell and confront and holler i've i've always found that the very best way to have hard conversation during good times is to sit down with the person i love uh at a place that they really enjoy and feel comfortable if it's a dinner if it's outside if it's it and then to try and bring it up when we come into them with um anger what they hear is that anger when we come into those conversations with genuine love and concern it's much easier for them to understand that um so that this is in my opinion is cannabis addiction most similar to alcohol addiction or does it have a a different effect so what you use is just diagnostic criteria for them the symptoms are obviously very very different the lethality associated with alcohol alcohol is far and away the most um dangerous substance inside of this country unless you were to count tobacco but um from immediate deaths and uh it's not necessarily that alcohol is way worse than all these other things it's just more commercialized and used so we covered that one you asked how can we convince the legislators that legalization doesn't increase revenue you just simply show them the numbers um that have come out of colorado california everybody else and then um you you hope that they actually look at that and don't get pulled into the political discussion um there was a for somebody i got you kim for somebody who really wants to understand that question there was a brilliant researcher who sat on the pro legalization side of this thing who unfortunately passed away uh two years ago i think named mark kleiman out of the university of washington and dr kleinman had dedicated the last i think 20 years of his career into trying to determine exactly how you could adequately tax this vice substance to pay for the the impacts of it without just building the black market up and as you've seen colorado california all these places that have big commercial industries our black market has um dramatically increased it hasn't decreased it's increased since so where dr kleinman came up with um what was almost an impossibility like to tax it at a high enough rate that you would make up for the costs associated with you would just create a black market to tax it at a low enough rate um to get rid of the black market you wouldn't even get close to it you have to look at tobacco and alcohol as the paradigm any vice any by substance so we've got 60 years worth of data and for every dollar that we earn in taxing alcohol it costs us about nine dollars and for every dollar that we earn in taxing tobacco it costs us about eleven dollars societally kim i was just going to add thank you those are really great points um on our on that follow-up page the cannabis page um judy put together some talking points i also shared that piece that jeff has together that jeff hanley mentioned at the beginning so also a finder for how to find your legislator so that i think is the most important thing you can do and they should be paying attention right now because if you haven't noticed it's election season so what uh what kind of tax structure do you recommend for concentrate thc products um i am sort of a you you figure this out and i don't live there uh don't tell me in colorado what to do which was what pissed me off because like all the people who were pushing this were from california and stuff when they came out um and so i'm gonna let you guys make up your own decision on that well in just about everything but this is why i'm fr concentrates just have no place in the world none like they don't belong until we have a much better understanding of what they are doing to the human brain and body the only place that they have any worth is in the portfolio of the cannabis industry they don't belong in a person's brain or body so what is my suggested tax rate for that none because don't sell it because when we're selling it we're just kind of pandering to what it is they want to do um how did i overcome my struggles i just woke up one day and everything was better uh what no it was awful um a lot a lot of 12-step was what did it for me um i got involved in that world and that's a very long and um interesting story that took place a lot of it between pennsylvania and washington dc um but uh what they say you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired and eventually i just got that gift of desperation where i i i wanted something else um inevitable got that one got that one okay why are states putting this question on the voters ballot if the lessons from colorado show it's a bad idea when's the last time we did things that made great political sense i i don't care which side of this thing you're on if you like the dude from reality television or if you like the dude who's been in politics for 50 years i don't care who you're going to vote for i'll ask you do we really have a choice between the finest two americans when his politics made sense and the reason why these things end up on a ballot is because you have massive commercial industries behind it and those industries can get anything they want to on the ballot i've joked before that if you give me enough money i'll bet you i can get on the ballot and convince enough coloradans that um in order to keep our fires at bay here we should sacrifice a puppy every monday in town square give me enough money to sell that message and you can sell anything um ben i just think we need to note that in pennsylvania we're not talking about a ballot issue we're talking about legislation so it could happen without anybody's input other than the people in harrisburg you know the only people who've done that so far quick little trivia here the only state so far who has passed legislatively anybody illinois no illinois people of pennsylvania you could put yourselves up right next to the state that brought us everything else that takes place in illinois um okay i'm gonna run through the questions that we have here i didn't think medical marijuana could be prescribed to children until i did an assessment so again i'll um make sure you get the vernacular uh straight on it you cannot prescribe marijuana can't be prescribed and i don't know what the specific laws are in colorado um you can be under 18 and get a recommendation here judy do you know the answer to that one or jeff yeah it is illegal in pennsylvania for anyone under the age of 18 however a caregiver can get registered and on behalf of of the um their their child or half of the youth of the year there are some fda approved medications that um one in particular that can be just fantastic for children especially children with a very rare um seizure disorder um called epidialex and so that is a cannabis derived medication that is prescribed often to young kids well i mean often there's probably a couple hundred kids in the entire state on maybe maybe 100 kids in the whole state because of such a rare condition but other than that no nobody's telling a kid that they should smoke something so explain how tolerance is different from alcohol so here's going to be your i'm going to give you a two-minute answer to a 20-minute question um you get to a point of tolerance with alcohol where your body doesn't let you get any more tolerant we've seen this um jaundice liver failure kidney failure etc you get to a point where ethanol so saturates things that um you're just not able to keep putting it in because you'll die and then ultimately um you it'll take you less and less and less alcohol the further you go down the spectrum to get intoxicated because your body's no longer processing it well enough the difference with thc and one of the because there is no uh lethality associated with overdose from it works very very differently it saturates and binds to cannabidiol receptors rather than um anyway so what ends up happening is we just over saturate those receptors and over saturate those receptors and different from the other drugs particularly alcohol you have cannabidiol receptors throughout your entire body i mean almost every little bit of you has these receptors inside of the top of your head to your toes and so what we'll end up doing is um creating a um a need for introduced uh thc to bind to these receptors in in such large amounts that what your body produces naturally won't be able to bind to it so um the way that it's different is the tolerance is essentially unending like you can just keep getting more and more and more and more tolerant um i i really encourage you to watch some youtube videos and you guys have seen me before you know my favorite guy is um somebody called stoner's r weed um and because he has a program called kill a friend day where he gives people his first their first concentrate hit but the thing that's so interesting about him is he consumes concentrates regularly and you can see people who the first time they consume a concentrate um acute psychosis passing out go crazy you see a blood pressure spike and things like this and then you see people who've been consuming concentrates for a little bit they can consume and consume and consume and have no noticeable affect change so you can keep going forever withdrawal symptoms probably the easiest thing for you to do is just google that they'll give you those um definitively the the most frustrating ones that we see for people are um sleep uh and anxiety and diet issues but uh anxiety and aggression are pretty big ones too you mentioned deaths and seems and and seem to imply that there have been overdose deaths caused by over consumption of thc are there such cases no not really i mean there's like one or two in the literature but i think they're probably pretty crazy uh and weird little one-offs however to say that no one has ever died as a result of is asinine it's to say that no one has ever died of tobacco because no one has ever overdosed from it to say that no one has ever died from um falling asleep at the wheel because they didn't overdose falling asleep at the wheel people died doing dumb things when you're intoxicated you tend to do more dumb things and there is case after case after case in colorado i wrote a chapter about it um even back then about the people who who took the lives of others directly because they were intoxicated so no uh overdose not a thing it's not a thing uh you're not gonna overdose from thc for those of us not experienced in this area can you explain how butter wax and chatter would be consumed i understand vaping yeah yes but is shatter smoke like crack yes it is it's a rock um so you would smoke it uh like you would smoke anything else in rock form so vaping is obviously the easiest because there's no associated smell with it um but it's a hot knife it's a superheated needle um that's that's how you do that judy would like to answer this question live is that what it said no no you would like it yeah isn't there some controversy about the study that showed association with marijuana use and schizophrenia and teens um so it's not a study it's multiple studies at this point like multiple and um no no there's no controversy unless you want people to allow your industry and the the controversy is going to come from the people who are waiting to profit on it what can scientist researchers do to contribute to this issue um we have a couple of pretty brilliant minds here in colorado working on some large long term which you must understand is the importance of longitudinal um as opposed to um quick short-term ones and the information that we need more than anything we're getting in utero and early life exposure data right now uh our university of colorado hospital and dr apollo riggs but what we really need is more and better long-term understandings on brain and um body everything below the shoulders of of actual high potency so not 16 uh that's that would be the the most important thing the other thing i would be particularly interested in is the sociology around um there was a book in if for those of you in the medical or scientific world um springer who publishes the medical textbooks that our doctors um use when they're in med school to uh to to to it's where all the textbooks are this year they published cannabis and medicine and uh it has uh experts from every single field of medicine um explaining interactions with drug drug different all sorts of stuff from every field of medicine and um i actually got to co-author the section on treatment and recovery from and one of the things that we could use some more research on um is recovery from as well as drugs what specific regulations would you recommend limiting location of cannabis stores advertising potency i wrote all of that in the book so again more commercials for it which i usually suck at doing but i make a buck 50 every time you buy one of those unless you buy you so go ahead and i think i stopped charging you guys long ago to do this so i'm a book um but i wrote about that it needs to be a progressive policy of um discipline that's associated with until you eventually get to a point where the economics of it don't make sense for them to do it anymore but i i wrote all about how i would do it did i miss him me comparing how the recreational legalization will affect the medical field no because i didn't really do it and i think that's probably way better asked um of your experts um here in pennsylvania who have a better idea i worked for an alternative school in pennsylvania we had an intake interview with a student who was prescribed medical use by a doctor so again um recommended versus prescribed um he just like every other pennsylvanian just like every other american cannot be prescribed cannabis they can be prescribed cannabis medications or recommended cannabis my advice to law enforcement officers when talking to students and parents about marijuana is to be as informed as possible i think a lot of the times when when we come at them and they hear old guard they shut down when you know if we're not up to date on the language and you know if if we come in and we're like hey you know you kids and your reefers and you're smoking on your mary janes and you're if if we're not informed and if we don't understand what it is they're actually consuming they're going to write us off and not listen to us at the beginning so i i guess um it's this it's the balancing the fine line between trying to be cool when we're not cool i don't know maybe maybe you're totally cool fred i like i'm not at all so i don't try to you know use words and be like yo kids this presentation is going to be straight fire you know y'all should hashtag you know what don't do that [ __ ] um what i do is just try and be me but also try to be informed so i would recommend sir um that you you just be hip to and aware of what it is they're doing and then um go into it asking questions more than telling and then if you've got enough decent information you can um you can feel those questions well the other thing i will tell you is as somebody who part of my living amends is trying to to make up to for the the crappy stuff that i did uh that involved law enforcement down there um you call me absolutely any time uh and oh here let me put my email in here and i'll help um if it's specific stuff if it's not i'll help you any way i can because um i have a great respect for the work that it is that that you and your fellow officers are doing and i thank you all for it that's all the questions fred there's my email address uh what am i missing uh there were actually a couple in the chat box that we didn't get to the definition of casual use actually it's not super well defined we would we're using two times a week okay and just for clarification you cited that that study from australia earlier um just kind of looking like is this really real 30 is now the rate of addiction can you clarify that yes it's really real um so the study is it was funny kim when you sent me the link the pubmed link it had that other researcher's name on it um uh i had seen the original publication with wayne hall um at all who is sort of the one of the leading thought leaders about but yes it's absolutely real and it's not some uh dr volkov at nida said three years ago and she was saying publicly three years ago just just wait you're going to see 30 40 addiction rates once the science can actually show what we're seeing on the streets and the problem is to get journal published peer-reviewed science takes time to throw out some sort of tagline and and quick little answer to something takes no time so science takes time wonderful uh we are i can't believe it's 10 o'clock this has flown jeff do you have any last uh thoughts comments no no no kim thank you again for having me and i appreciate it ben can you um can you provide us with a citation somebody asked for the guy from washington mark clyman about the taxation of the substance can you can you get that to us sometime so that's a summary of about 20 years of work for him so look into who mark kleiman is and read his research i i i think it's k-l-e-i-m-a-n um okay brilliant brilliant guy uh but totally sat on the us thought we should fully legalize thought we should fully allow for commercial sales um so somebody who you know he and i would be on opposite sides on the panel but brilliant researcher and um really couldn't quite get there okay thank you just put a put a link in the chat box yeah so um ben we can't thank you enough that was fabulous and um you're such a dear um treasure for all of us so thank you thank you to everyone who joined us we had more than 100 folks with us consistently this morning um which is amazing so thank you all very very much uh jeff ben judy thanks great being with you have a good rest of your day everyone follow up on that page oh and take our survey please when this ends take our survey and follow up on that page conversation dot zone slash cannabis bye-bye everyone thank you bye thanks kim talk to you soon thanks so much", "_FKYikezRng": "hi and welcome back to cannabis infused motherhood my name is Sabrina and I have created this channel just as an avenue to express my love for cannabis I'm posting blog posts talk about different mindset techniques for healing and things like that so if you're in any of that please subscribe I'll be coming out with more and more content as time goes on um if you haven't seen my videos going over the car accident I was in in July you can go and check those out I'll also be recording a video of my healing from then until now so yeah if you're interested in learning about my experience and what happened you can go ahead and watch those videos as well so yeah today I decided to record a little bit of a tutorial for how to make chocolate chip cannabis cookies which I made because I had some leftover can of butter which I also have a tutorial on how to make your own peanut butter so if you want to watch that I'll leave that below as well so yeah I had some leftover cannabutter I was craving some edibles because I really like the pain relief and euphoric effect that edibles can provide even though they take a little longer to kick in so yeah so I will be going over the recipe it's very simple recipe my cookies turned out pretty good there are about a hundred milligrams apiece I'll also link below if you want to find out how much like milligrams of THC is in your edibles there is a converter where you can figure out exactly what is in each of your cookies that you make if you want to keep track of your dosage and not go over or not take enough okay so let's get into the recipe so first you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 and you want to add all your dry ingredients to a bowl so you want 2 and 1/3 cups of flour 1 teaspoon salt and one teaspoon of baking soda and put that into one bowl and then in a separate bowl you're going to want to take six ounces of cannabutter I used a scale to weigh out six ounces of the cannon-fire that I previously made and then you want to take one ounce of regular butter and add that to a separate bowl with fewer peanut butter next you're gonna want to add one cup of brown sugar into the bowl with the butters I was using a half cup measuring so I put two in there to equal a cup and then you're gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract oh and also three quarter cups of regular sugar for all my recipes I just kind of wing the amounts as you see I didn't actually measure out a teaspoon of vanilla I just kind of plops them in there but that's okay and then you're gonna want to mix up your sugar with your butter really really well until it's nice and smooth my butter was in the fridge so it the texture was a little rough so it took a long time to get it to that creamy texture if you wanted to soften it a little bit I think it would go a little more smoothly then then mine did so once it's all mixed up you're gonna want to add two eggs to your mixture one at a time and then mix that in as well the recipe calls for two large eggs so that's what I used and again mixing it up and once that is all blended together you can then add your bowl of dry ingredients into the mixture and then continue mixing until it's smooth and turns into a batter and after you add your flour mix you're going to want to put in about 1 and 3/4 cups of chocolate chips and then again you just mix it all together till it is mixed and blend it and looks like a nice cookie batter and once that is done then you basically just throw your batter onto a cookie sheet I lined mine with wax paper just to prevent sticking on the pan itself and then you baked in the oven for about nine to eleven minutes I think mine were pretty much done at ten minutes so you want to make sure that you could use are nice and golden brown before you take them out of the oven so we have and you let them cool and you can eat your cookies and have a nice buzz going on thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this recipe and let me know how your cookies turned out in the comments below if you do decide to give it a chance and if you like cannabis content and wanting to get into control of your subconscious mind and using it in order to serve you rather than hold you back that's what this channel is all about so hit that subscribe button and I'll see on the next one bye", "mZtCqDASxkc": "hey everybody it's me four Rolly here and we are back with episode 2 of cycle 9 in the fmg canopy growing four extracts I am pretty excited about what's going on in here I'll do a quick recap before we kind of dive into a couple new I guess topics or issues or whatever you want to call it as I mentioned we are at date or maybe I didn't but we're at day 10 here in flowers so we're a week later after our last video and you can see that things have stretched quite a bit I'll give you that kind of same shot that I gave you last time where you saw the 24-karat in the back pushing up the scrog net now it's just a complete jungle of everything getting pushed up but we have 15 plants in here actually that's not true look at this I should bring this up since we are recapping and things have changed so we brought out two new plants did a little side plants here we might even bring out one more but we've got a Grape Ape in a Durban poison - excellent strains also two of which are over here so we now have seventeen plants in here but two of them are just going to be basically hand fed from the top as well as the bottom to do a little kind of flood and drain not really flood and drain but top feed and bottom feed I guess just in these trays and you know mother with Coco all the kind of same stuff getting safe at all the same nutrients and yeah two more side plants but two of the same strains which are both contained in this table I'll call this table number four and we'll go backwards this time we've got three Grape Ape and one Durbin poison those are all fairly spotty plants dirt and poison will stretch up a little bit more the grapes are just rolled nice tight nodes stackers take this one right here in the center you can see so I got a nice crown on her and several nice clothes nodes their big fat leaves and we'll definitely have to be Tooting subdue foliated in this room at one point but that's Table one or four sorry that's table for Table three over here is all flow that is one full table flow we are running another table flow with house and garden nutrients so I'm kind of excited to see how the 4v4 turns out they are in different size pots but the smaller ones vegetative wise have bigger pots and the more vegetated veg vegetables but more vegetables in the back RN I believe three gallons of these are in five years over here at this table this is the stretchy table number two we've got this massive 24-karat here in front she stretches like crazy right off the bat as you can see the note spacing is well pretty far to say the least she'll have some nice top columns and everything but she is spread out quite a bit as you can see she's taking up half that table that 4x4 table and she'll get plenty of side lighting from this metal halide that is on a thousand Watts right now back to on that same table also stretching up nicely are the cookies and cream from exotic genetics and those are gonna produce some nice dark purple frosty buds that are quite small compared to some of the other ones in this room but that's kind of expected with those cookie cuts and last but not least table whatever one to whatever this is the last table and this introduction is biochem in the back there and our white cross over here which is the white cross with critical push we've got our chubby bunny up front here and another cookies-and-cream which is just this little guy right here not too crazy on this one I said hello to our little friends ladybugs just kind of hanging out making sure we don't get overrun or really any pests are in here and while we're on that I did want to talk about this last time since it was pulsar the veg period but our pest management really was a regiment of neem oil sprayed probably once every week to two weeks and then we had or no yeah that was like every other week as well as spinosad was every other week so I think those are one week on one week off kind of thing and then we've been using the method one and Method one is just basically a bunch of essential oils smells delicious when you spray it probably tastes good I joked about taking the dab of it but obviously that probably would not be a good idea maybe it I don't know I'm not gonna suggest that I just you know April Fool's haha in any case method one we were using at least weekly that one it's not too harsh on the plants at all neem can be kind of a pain in the butt you really got to make sure you don't spray that with the lights on oh yeah between those three foliar feeds and nematodes and ladybugs we really hit all of our plants hard and veg mostly because there's kind of two critical points where you have to worry about pests I've found at least in our seasonal weather here and that seems to be in the fall right before winter as things are getting cold out they want to find their way indoors and then in spring which is kind of what we're dealing with right now where everything's kind of coming back to life so you really don't want to let your pest management slip at those two times especially and fortunately we're pretty much all but clear on anything in our garden certainly nothing in our flower rooms you know check every plant before you bring it out here but that's not to say that you know things can slip through the cracks well we're staying on top of it and everything is looking pretty darn healthy as you can see here the white balance might be a little bit off just because of this metal halide taking up a little or producing a little bit more light this time than our last video so I may have to correct it again before our next one but yeah they're getting quite a bit of light so we've got the four HPS hoods going and the one metal halide in the center totaling about 56 to 57 hundred watts that's just I believe on 1000 watt mode and these are all on the supermoon lumens or turbo bose smoke mode turbo boost mode which Springs them to about eleven forty watts per bulb or per her let's see so one of the things I'm really excited to share with you guys in terms of the new stuff that's going on is we finally are adding mammoth pee into the garden so we're here at day ten yesterday's feeding at day nine they got their first dose of this if you look at the back of the bottle don't do that let me see if I can focus this in a little bit better so if you look at the back of the bottle for the bloom phase you're looking at starting at about 0.6 milliliters per liter we're sorry milliliters per gallon and hydro going all the way up to 0.6 milliliters per gallon soil is a little bit different soil goes all the way up to 4 milliliters per gallon as you can see and then there's the rest of it with the seedling and clone stage a vegetative stage etc so really they're recommending doing 0.6 milliliters per gallon and hydro systems which is technically what we're running here in our flood and drain systems even though we do have a cocoa medium and I think what my plan is is to bring it from about 0.5 which is the first dosage to 1 milliliter per gallon and then possibly up to a maximum of 1 point 5 milliliters per gallon because we are kind of in a system that's a little bit of both hydro and not really a soil medium it's still cocoa but it's not true hydroponics like the DWC or something like that would be so I think having a nice balance between will work well and like I said they got their first feeding at day 9 and today they got their second feeding at day 10 and I know I can't really judge anything right now I took some photos on their first dates so kind of basically documenting a couple of the colas where they're at right before we get to that really like the integration of the microbes into the plants and them actually utilizing them because within a couple hours I can't imagine they're after being fed I can't imagine they're really utilizing them but this is my first time using it so who else all right I'm gonna go ahead chop the video right now before we get to last couple topics and we'll see you guys again and else by ad 814 I think is what we're working when we're gonna do our lollipop so now let me just chop it real quick we'll be right back alright so like I mentioned our lollipop will be at day 14 I believe I've been stretching it going to like day 21 22 even 23 and Beyond sometimes depending on the plants but I really didn't want to encourage any vertical growth right off the bat so I didn't do any lolli popping at day 0 or 1 like I sometimes do as well and I want to kind of let them start focusing on the frost and blood production as soon as possible without stressing them too far into that so I want to do the lollipop being a little bit earlier on than I've been there's gonna be quite a bit of salad coming out of here I'm definitely gonna leave a lot of this vegetation over here and over here I'm definitely stretching up more on these 24 carrots of course but more or less these kind of back plants will get really kind of their their stems raised or their what's the hope how do they put it like their ears raised or lowered ears lowered man I really butcher that one yeah the plants are getting their ears lowered so in any case lollipop peeing at day 14 for this cycle and last but not least well actually you know there is one more thing I am gonna do some top feeding I think I might have mentioned that but we are going to do top feeding with really let probably a light dose of maybe everything but I really especially want to make sure the pH is right so making sure that soil pH is kind of stabilized with those top feeds but I also be adding those silica and humic products and probably an extra dosage of buds for bat guano I have not yet added that to my reservoirs but I will be after this first kind of Reds change and that will come probably in like two days so again at day ten but at day zero I guess we filled up the rises with our first batch of nutrients I did a top-off around day hold on let me think about this oh that would have been day five or six I think maybe day six so come day like 11 maybe 12 we're gonna have to change the residence so they'll probably get two more feedings out of it and we'll go ahead and change Reza's and that's when we'll start adding but soul back 102 the buzzes themselves the reason I held off initially on that partly because I didn't have it at day one but also it really does those organics and stuff especially the hue makes and Silica's which is why I'm top feeding those organics can really like chunk up your reza's and your pumps and everything you know fortunately I have the capability of using a power washer to clean my rises and my tables the pumps you got to kind of hand clean them with brushes and whatnot but you know if you guys have the capability of running a power washer it really helps cleaning the tables of stuff so you don't have to sit there and hand scrub them which I did for years it really sucks so I'm really fortunate and blessed to have a power washer at this point oh yeah so last but not least I wanted to talk a little bit about our VPD our temps humidity all that kind of stuff where we're where we've been where we're at right now you can see up here our current humidity is 50% and our current temperature is 79 degrees Fahrenheit you see the humidity changing we rocket 41 to 75 in the last 24 hours in relative humidity and 66 degrees to 81 degrees and our temperature difference so it's actually just before I shot this video it got up to 81 it was like 75 but I had to turn off some fans I was messing with some stuff so unfortunately you know that stagnant air for that five minutes or whatever kind of heated things up but the fan the exhaust fan is running right now and we're taking care of some of this heat so that's the temperature and humidity and in terms of our beat VPD chart we're definitely a little off right now so if you want to take like where were ya about 79 degrees and go over we're definitely in that red range I definitely want to be more like in that 65 to 70% humidity which we are getting up to but I'm certain that's nighttime humidity I know the dehumidifier did kick on during this video which I have it set to about 55% so maybe it's a little bit lower on the floor there but I honestly didn't really make sense I feel like heat rises which seems to bring humidity with it so maybe I should turn that down a little bit but again it's you know getting pretty pretty high in humidity at nighttime and if we're dipping into the high 60s at nighttime that makes me a little bit nervous just letting them get too moist and too cool so really I want to be in the like 72 maybe minimum at night and like 77 to 79 in the day you know and then keeping my humidity up so that's kind of where you want to be with the vapor pressure deficit to give these plants the ideal conditions to grow in to provide the best health and to get the most resin out of them and yeah that's pretty important I think so go ahead and check out for girli calm slash VPD you guys can see the chart I just showed you and download it and print it for yourselves I'm gonna go ahead chop it one more time because I don't have the timer display I have no idea for at like maybe five minutes eight minutes or 10 minutes but you know between 10 and 12 we generally get cut out so I'm going to cut it one more time and we'll wrap this video up okay so one more thing before you wrap it up here in net I guess like res top-off I did I forgot to kind of expand on that a little bit more about exactly what I added and we'll just go ahead and check out the new board here so you can kind of see and right here is where we did the top off so we topped it off with I think O's about yeah bout eight to ten gallons Oh 8 to 10 gallons was used so that's about the same of what we had and we brought it back to about 30 gallons maybe not like 32 or so and we added 75 milliliters of cocoa a and B 50 milliliters arise Oh 50 milliliters a boost 50 million milliliters of cal-mag and then I also added our Turpin error so I introduced Turpin ater and it rises we head and added that yet and we added that at 250 milliliters per I think leader that's what they say there's a shoot yeah it's--that's-- I think it's five milliliters per liters so I is what we were certain oh maybe was ten it must be ten milliliters billiard something like that but we're starting off at the low end of the dose and we're gonna bring that up as we go so we'll be isn't quite a bit of turpentine right thing so you can see here we added that 15 milliliters of mammoth pee when we added a mammoth pee and then there's our pH and EC kind of record so you see that mammoth he actually did bring it up a little bit the EC about point two two point three in each res and then our pH we've been trying to keep at five point nine to six point oh but that first feeding was a little bit high and that was just because the drift I'm kind of watching so staying on top of the res is with the pH when we need to and that's been maybe like two or three times a week I'll put a couple drops of either a pH down or we'll really just pH down I think at this point I don't think I've had to put any pH up at in them so that's gonna wrap it up here at day ten in the fmg canopy and the growing for extracts room definitely check me out on instagram at four Rowley I want to pull us up some more photos you can see these ladies are really throwing out some pistols so this is the white cross and and they're ready for flower I think I really do think that bud igniter helped kind of initiate the flowering phase and like I said earlier if you go back and look at some of these grape Apes they really got some crowns already there's another one there's that one we looked at earlier and even over here on this Durbin poison this is like a 10 11 weeks trained really started got some nice nice pistols forming in that bud so that's gonna be it for me check me out at four Rowley calm or your hats and stickers are available in stock currently and will course always be adding more I'm gonna get some shirts soon for you guys I've got some ideas what I want to screen print and I'm pretty excited for those well we'll have those by the cup at the latest pitch which is shoot coming up fairly soon it's less than two months away the Michigan cannabis cup so hopefully we'll see a lot of you guys there make sure you grab your tickets now not sure what the plan is for the grow to brown table but you can check me out there nine well [ __ ] 10:00 Eastern Time 7:00 Pacific every Friday night they went

especially for us youtubers and we always appreciate seeing you guys out there so hit that thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already until next time guys good luck and grow big", "w1afa7IBcb4": "[Music] my name is Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "IKbCbUcvZxc": "hello and welcome to my cooking show for today I'll be showing you how to make your own homemade Zahle pops these are fun and easy to make and they're really good okay now let's get on to the story all right so the ingredients that you'll need are sugar Cointreau blue Jolly Ranchers red green and purple and also you will need four appliances lollipop sticks and silicone molds the first step you will need to do and to make these is we need to crush up all of your power Jolly Ranchers except for purple this is because you will need those later on for your dark background then you put your different color matches into your molds separately randomize them for different and cool colors then you want to pre-heat your oven to 275 and then you want to put the Jolly Rancher molds in for 15 to 18 minutes and then when you take out let them cool after these have cooled you want to set these aside and go get your sugar and your corn syrup for this next step you will need a bowl to put your mixture in boil your mixture you will need one and a half cups of sugar 3/4 cups of chords are [Music] and 1/2 cup of water and then you will need to mix it around till it's a big mush and it looks sort of a brown color now you want to boiler your mixture until you get to 300 degrees Fahrenheit stir frequently for good texture and smooth surface for your lollipops now with your mixture you pour some and take each of them home that you'll be using so fold them up next crush your grape Jolly Ranchers do you have a a nice big shake now put the pieces of your grape Jolly Rancher into the molds as you had done you earlier make sure it's good and tight Cicotte whole mold filled up after your grape molds are done put your sticks in and then take your previously made candies and push them on top [Music] next let them cool and then have your own homemade lollipops now the last step of your homemade lollipops is to dig in [Music]", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much

they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "srqWHivQ9JQ": "a Miley didn't how y'all doing today I got a review another review from Japan crate when my sister got me ah this is a combination of savory snacks drinks and Japanese candy and she said there's one coming for my birthday 2 which was last week by it should be coming a couple days so actually cultures but this is the December ah December one and I'm coming to the end I still got some more stuff to review in I'm going to be trying out the Japanese lollipop bag of lollipops I got and with this picture look like my sister right there saying hi have a lollipop because I remember I did the mbox ice that looked like her she got big laughs at so that's cool it has a big thing Tanya you know what the things our knees is a Fuji a lollipop bag it says these traditional fruity lollipops our favorite with Japanese children simple yet satisfying flavors include orange grape apple strawberry well I decided to first go with great because my sister said that she just had a little bit of what was left on Japanese creating my sister gave her my niece gave my sister one of these because my niece bought one my sister said it tastes like medicine so i'm gonna have to try it out it's all in Japanese but you know it's great right there so I do the rapping again once be difficult wait a man get it open again and open kaido I mean and sometimes you pull out you know you pull out to think of that the whole thing of lollipop will come right off here it is right here it has like a sea has like a weird looking print it looks like a handprint kind of maybe it's not it's just weird look like he looks like that girl's hand right there kind of see oh let's give it a shot see how i taste see if it tastes like medicine actually done taste too bad I only it tastes like medicine it's not it kind of tastes like grape it takes like not the traditional great flavor which is really different it tastes like two grape this if you go to the farmers market you get the seeded grapes where the skin it comes up that's the type of grape this tastes like so it's a very very unique taste on off on a grape can you lead you you expect your traditional grape flavor but this is like us seeded grapes the great for the seeds and where the skinny comes off really good i like you these are bad all you don't try lollipops i got a whole bunch in here different types and i got some that my mom got me that I have to see if what I reviewed why didn't review but for this I give us an a tight end pretty decent very I'm glad you want with a different type of great but one the traditional great that you would expect so I give a 8 a-10 for when they call the the food yeeah great blog pop so until next time bye please take care of my Legion", "IsoBlBFQaRw": "[Music] you can see the seeds when you can't taste the very planting aids and the flavors and styles are very unique [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's go save the planet Oh [Music]", "wKHaFj1T8Lg": "*Galactic Music* Corinne: Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "j-XSDVyrrfc": "the opening and testing these out today I found the tootsie roll tootsie pop lip balm said have you ever seen anything like this we'll get that they have different flavor tipsy pops they have orange and chocolate and if you go down they have five different lip balm sticks and if you're not familiar with tipsy pump so you know here they are these are 20 50 pump they come in different flavors they're crunchy candy on the outside and in the middle there's this chewy chocolate you can look at those and compare them with the flavors let's do this here it is and this box is so adorable kind of like old-fashioned looking so I see three tootsie roll pop lip glosses and they look like they're in little jars it ceased to care but I don't actually think a stick is connected to it that would be so cool and I see different ones here ooh these are little charm pops we have green purple well I think this one is just tipsy roll flavor there red charm pop and the yellow let's open they are so colorful there's so many different colors going on here so we have the lemon yellow term pop flavor and I actually don't have any charm pops here but those are delicious to their kind of flat and round really yummy Lou here's the yellow man let's see if it smells like lemon wow this smells exactly like the lollipop I haven't had one in a really long time but just remembering the taste it smells a little sour and sweet and it definitely has a candy 12 it coming up next we have the wild cherry charms pump and this is my favorite I remember actually I have the yellow one on my lips right now it tastes I mean I'm not really eating it but just having it on my lips it tastes exactly like that lollipops so cool so I love any candies that are pink or red those are my favs see you I thought it be red is like a light pink [Music] just clear mmm this one is so much better this smells exactly like the lollipop as well it's a little tart a little sour a little sweet smells just like candy only now this one in the middle with the orange top it's got this lady on the air she looks kind of old fashioned this is a tootsie roll chocolate scented lip balm I'm guessing it's going to be brown inside see oh and it is it has the same color as a tipsy mmm this doesn't even just want like chocolate this smells like the real deal I could smell this all day long it's like you have a tootsie roll in your hand and you just melted it and you're smelling it off delish that is a really good one oh there's the green one and the green is watermelon I thought it was lying when I used to eat them maybe another watermelon see it's like a light lime green I think they make every single candy into a lip on now oh so good ooh this one's wedding so far it's such a sweet smell smells like a fresh watermelon doesn't have any color put some on my lip really really good I love anything that's watermelon too and the final charm pop up before we tucked up a little tipsy pops is great mmm it's kind of like a bluish purple the grape is really good too I always remember eating the red and the purple charm pumps and I definitely know this smells just like it it just smells like candy now that we try novel lip on sticks it's time for the tootsie pop these are little and let their lip walls or what they are they're so cool looking Lou it's kind of like a lip balm in a jar shut up before we start testing these out let's open up the water and see if you can try the real flavor so we need an orange chocolate and cherry I think we have some of those in here here's the orange one OOP and we're so lucky for that of this whole bag there was only one chocolate you have that and there's actually tons of cherry so we'll open those and see how they taste against the lip balm and what other flavors are in here what is watermelon wow this is a new one color is it it's like a light pink color really good and it tastes like a jolly rancher and inside it actually looks like the tootsie roll inside is green I see with a green color in there let me take a bite listen see well almost broke my tooth film it's a regular brown chocolate tootsie in there this is what's on the inside and then you have a yummy candy on the out this one kind of looks like cheery but it's different i think it's oh it's raspberry let's get all color looks like almost looks exactly the same mmm definitely raspberry like that one too and the last one is the blue this is great it's actually like a blue wrapper I thought it would be blueberry see who it is great it's purple really good it kind of tastes like the grape charm pop T so similar here we go so here is the orange took the palms right here imagine you would such a bright color mmm tastes really good I don't like it as much as the red one and here is the orange tootsie roll pop lip balm mmm smells so good it's just a clear color its a mix between chocolate and orange it's not the best scent in the world but it definitely does smell like the candy hmm and I wish it had a little color but it's just a clear pools and I really wish it had like a little plastic lollipop stick connected that would be so cute next up is the chocolate to see chocolate pub look at that one that kind of looks like lip gloss it's a lot softer and that brown color comes off clear which is amazing I don't know how they did that mmm this one smells so good this Mel's just like a tootsie roll it's really similar to this tipsy lip balm so somewhere but it's a little mark alone see and shiny so so good and let's see the chocolate prep I never chose it brown color the smell and taste is identical on to our final the cheering here is their kind of looks like a pink peaches color smell so good it's funny because it doesn't just smell like plain cherry it smells like cherry and chocolate together I'm really really good yeah and maybe even a little bit of coconut I don't know where the coconut comes in i just smell it and that is a really nice block it says lip balm that I uncooked neither the lip gloss for sure and read hmm this is my favorite besides the new flavor of watermelon i think that's for that so we tested them all out and after testing them and tasting the real lollipop thief now almost exact I don't know how they did this but it's amazing here's another look at the term public phone we have yellow pink brown green and great purple one that it's like a bluish color you guys can leave me a comment and let me know what your favorite pulp is or your favorite color and here's a look at the three tipsy pop jars you have orange chocolate and cherry the best send was the chocolate and my favorite color probably was this pink one you got", "SHMsnBnAeTk": "welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida for pouring our hot sugar today and it's already flavored with strawberries and cream flavoring today we're going to do something a little unusual we're going to make spiral lollipops but instead of making them in the traditional round shape we're going to make them in a hearty shape we have the color and then we stir carefully to boil all the water out we don't want any water left because this will make the candy stick while it may look like we're adding more sugar here or not we're adding citric acid most fruits have an acidic content to them and our flavoring doesn't so we need to add it back in the citric acid may only be added after a certain point where the candy will be too hot and the acid will burn leaving a lousy taste in the tasters mouth the candy that was against the table and the bars is now cooled down a lot but the bits of the center is still scalding hot wave to mix the candy together to make it get to an even temperature so we can work with it as the candy changes states it goes from liquid to semi solid to more solid and eventually it gets solid enough that we can put it over a hook and fold it again and again until it becomes white the sugar starts as a deep amber but as we fold it over and over we trap millions of air bubbles and it makes the candy become a brilliant white each one of those little air bubbles acting is a mirror to reflect the light it's time to assemble the candy and we're going to move the candy to a temperature controlled surface that will slow down the cooling of the candy to give us time to do our assembly we're making red and white stripes the white stripes are there to reflect the light through the red stripes to make it look more jewel like if you want to order our candy you can try it for yourself and get it at our website WWE Network now that we have a big log of candy we need to get it down to the size of a rope so we can spiral our lollipops we do this by pinching off one end pulling out a log slowly and then pulling out rod by rod until they all are right to turn into lollipops we twist the rope making the pattern go around it and then we take the rope and we make it into a spiral the heart-shaped lollypop starts as a traditional circular lollipop then the lollipop gets passed on to the second candy maker the second candy maker takes the candy and puts it into a steel form which they press it into the shape of the heart they then take a wooden stick and insert it into the candy making it into a lollipop if you ever make it to Tallahassee to see us make our candies live here at lofty pursuits you can also go to our website wpri.com", "vUtA3HafLNg": "hi today we're going to make some sour apple lollipops using two different types of citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more videos please remember to subscribe to\nthis channel thank you guys so much goodbye

"GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "qhfZyTBPoQ0": "today a little bit of baking they really making some caramel lollipops what makes these camera livebox specialty masks were using today we butter / can of water whatever you want to call it get high better that make you feel good juju today we're using my form of it I like youth coconut oil cause it draws out the most THC out of the lead for some reason I don't necessarily know the science part of that don't but I do it with very good understanding of how that [ __ ] works and it can be substituted for a regular letter so the recipe were using today actually calls for regular butter but I'm just substituting same thing at cold temperature or room temperature cocoa butter I'm sorry coconut oil will freeze and make it usable as butter if you melt it it's gonna become a will so you can use it it's very malleable now we're gonna let me show you guys what we're working with here we've got two tablespoons yes two tablespoons of water one and a half tablespoons of vinegar and we've got one teaspoon of salt sea salt to be specific a high-quality it looks like nothing's in there but daily hey there's something in there I promise yeah then we have the cocoa might throw up my baby boo but baby doodoo and it's gonna taste bad hum and then we've got one cup of brown sugar right here and last but not least we have 1/4 cup of sheriff liked it or not the darkness once it's all finished we're gonna mix in some vanilla extract the only reason I don't have that way that was because I like to do this by eye so to speak they call for a teaspoon just kind of portion today the recipe calls for us they pretty much just mix all of this in the pot so yeah man have you come over here I'll show you how to do this by the way we're drinking a Bohemia it's a pilsner don't really know the [ __ ] oh yeah it tastes good sure the first yeah so you put the heat on after you add everything yes okay he goes on a hot pot of burning sugar before you think you started it makes sense isn't the bottom of the sugar 1/3 water in vinegar hmm no been the corn syrup this person a little tricky because the brew is in the bowl this is why you should always have a rubber spatula I've mentioned that before make sure you keep your rubber spatula with you okay was it medium I don't know how you're still worse don't use an electric stove and I don't I don't know sponsored by Stokes if you use an electric stove at home you need to throw that [ __ ] trash yeah stir it a little bit right make sure I'm not sure the bottles combined yeah and then we can add that I stood this butter here all right so we're just gonna pretty much get this to a boil I'll show you guys what it looks like on the back to the world but the whole ultimate goal here or the end goal is to get this to be 300 degrees that's gonna be a hard crack it's much easier when you have what's called the candy thermometer Andy it's very easy to measure and even tells you what it's called that's gonna be called a hard crack meaning like this it's gonna be not chewy little more than a lollipop texture so yeah we're just gonna blow this out and let everything out together so at first this is not gonna look like it's coming together it's gonna look very separate like your sugar that the bottom of it and that the link was just kinda at the top not makes me bitter but as you can see keep boiling this is not something that you want to keep stirring by the way just stop as you keep boiling you'll see that it starts to blend together okay we're just about at 300 now which should be a hard crack temperature and starting to solidify just a little bit have any worried that the wood is starting to come together so to speak so go for like two more minutes we're gonna give it a chance to cool it down and we'll come back and show you when it cooled and then let's start to transfer it to the mold but it means this little container here it's just a lot of measuring jar to make it a little bit more you won't and then I just also add a little bit of vanilla extract just gonna starting to cool down I'll give you some flavoring actually I want to add something else for flavorings so that I really know the proof why should it rate and nephews away right there you are alright now we're gonna start pulling into the molds ooh that's hot this book mmm cannot fast swirl the lollipop stick in there to get it's all to sit yeah I don't work a little clipping at this - I chose always so size [Laughter] that's okay they're still warm and I solidify them when I close the lid go for it on that right now we need to work quickly because the rest of the mold arch the caramel is still very hot and I want guys to come out so I'm just gonna work work on the stick place man it won't be some sideways ass looking sticks sorry another thought mm-hmm were you making this video about was perfect hmm cuz you're on time oh yeah you tell I don't work out I do push ups and push ups push ups when you lift your fingers are the only thing gonna work out okay now to form Oh as you can see it got a little a little friendly with you yeah yo right here Cheers seal them up pop them in the freezer an apartment afraid of me back in like counting so you saw who I thought put bets at the cool yours one attack in like ten minutes hmm you see what they look like boom should care more heart Dali Pablo look at the back look at the front try this yeah there is wait in there you taste the weed yeah tastes like a lollipop

"[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "yzJWSrvHsts": "today welcome to Todd's kitchen lollipops have been around for literally hundreds of years they're incredibly simple to make but they're actually pretty expensive to buy their shops so why not just make them home they're just as delicious and you can make any flavor color that you like so join me today as make my version of lollipops okay so to start this off I have a pot on the stove on a medium heat so it to the pot I'm going to add two cups of sugar then 2/3 of a cup of glucose or corn syrup know as a hint I've just warmed it up in the microwave it just makes a lot easier to work with and finally a quarter cup of water and I'm also using a candy thermometer now we want to go for the hard crack stage which is about 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius give or take but if you have one of these candy thermometers they're actually very cheap to buy you can get them online they're only about ten fifteen dollars but when it comes to candy it just makes life so much easier so over the medium heat we're just coming to give this stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved now you can also add some for example coloring if you like then you could also add some flavoring it's completely up to you I'm just keeping this as a basic recipe so I'll leave any coloring or flavoring that you choose to add up to you a lot of people like the plain should be a taste but if you want to add like say peppermint essence or raspberry or it's you know completely up to you and to the colors that you choose so it's gonna start to get to the stage where it's going to bubble now as you can see we've got some sugar crystals just on the inside so which is with a wet brush we're just going to brush them down which is basically dissolving the sugar back into the mix and this will just stop crystals from forming on top of our sugar mixture which basically ruins of the whole thing so just keep on doing this all the way around whenever you see these sugar crystals forming so puffs and keeping an eye on the sugar crystals forming on the outside just keep an eye on the temperature until we get to the hard crack stage which is again 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius now you may be tempted to turn the temperature up to make it rise up faster to get to the right temperature faster but slow and steady is the only way to do it because if you do it too fast you can actually going to burn that sugar and it honestly doesn't take that long at all whatsoever probably about five to ten minutes to get to the right temperature so take your time don't do it too fast and you'll get some lovely candy and also my best advice is apart from the occasional watered down of the sides what have you do don't stir it because I should make things worse you just want it to cook by itself let it do its thing just let it slowly come up to the right temperature so all you have to do is just occasionally Pat down the sides and that's it it's very very simple okay so it's just about to hit the hard crack stage now I've had the tilt the pan just slightly because the thermometer was in 100% under but it's just hitting the hard crack stage right now so take it straight off the heat okay now quickly I've got a bowl here with some ice an ice bath we're just going to place that in there and this will stop the sugar from cooking just don't let it touch the glass sides because if we leave it by itself it's going to continue cooking so we just want that to stop straight away [Music] otherwise it's going to get too much of a caramelized look and it's got a slight caramelized look but that's okay doesn't have to be perfect as long as it's each her when we've done some just poured it into a another pan this is a milk pan but I'm using this because it has this whip on it and this one doesn't so it's going to make a lot easier when we want to make our popsicles now this is a part where we have to work fast so I've got a baking tray here line with non-stick baking paper that I've also breezed with some more oil just to be on the safe side so we're just going to pour in small amounts like so okay that's enough and we're going to add a popsicle stick now these are a new one I found they're like a paper based one so no more plastic and while this too wet just decorate them any way you want that's going to be done now while the mixture is still fluid so just continue on making up all about popsicles so you can find those new paper base ones fantastic for the environment if I just use what you've got and this is what I want to go with a clear one because this way I can add some decorations to it so again you can still use color it's completely up to you and you can use a flavor that hopefully it's a flavor that doesn't have a color to it if it does well that's again that's okay this is so versatile you can do anything that should like with it [Music] okay so that was more than enough to make a few batches now it depends on the size of the lollipops you want to make so I made up another couple of sets of these so we're gonna let these sit here for at least two hours to completely set so they'll be nice and hard they're going to be wondering what am I gonna do with the pot cuz it's obviously gonna have some pretty hard sugar in it by now it's very very simple all you do is just fill it with water leave it for a few hours then simply pour it out because the sugars just going to dissolve into the water and it will disappear like magic so don't worry about any hard scrubbing or scraping just simply fill it with water set forget it come back a few hours later it's gone and now would you look at those delicious candy lollipops that turned out nice and clear and pretty with those extra sprinkles and let's be honest it's a hundred percent sugar so you know it's going to be a hundred percent good so they really have turned out very well they're incredibly delicious and also incredibly simple to make and again who doesn't love lollipops especially when they're nice and colorful and fun with sprinkles you could choose any sprinkles that you like see in Australia we call those hundreds and thousands or you can go for the stars and honestly I never know what these ones are called but they look great they're like little mini pearls and you don't even have to use sprinkles you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like they're incredibly versatile and no matter what flavor you choose they're going to taste simply delicious [Music]", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "8qmJ2itWHec": "what's up you guys welcome back to our channel and welcome to another episode of stuck at home with Audrey and we we are making Sarah Padres yay everything that's going around like on tick-tock and stuff so I wanted to try it myself to see if I can find a healthier alternative to actually eating sour punch gummies so let's start by showing you some epic b-roll and then we'll get into the recipe yeah [Music] so these are the ingredients that you're going to need some jello grapes and a lemon so the first thing you want to do is squeeze the lemon onto your grapes and then you want to mix it so that it is evenly coated then you pour your jello into different sipoc bags or a bowl whatever you choose to do this is what you're gonna end up with the next thing that you want to do is divide your grapes into all the different Ziploc bags and then you just shake shake shake and then you basically just repeat the process with all the other different jello flavors and then you just put all the different flavor grapes into one bowl so that looks really colorful and [Music] it is done first impression you guys it looks so colorful look at this look at this Wow yep so as we mentioned we got the blueberry flavor what's called berry blue berry blue flavor this is strawberry we've got dark reddish cherries and we got the yellow one like right here is lemon yes I will show it cuz I love strawberry Cheers don't take a shower you know it's really good you know when you say like South pasture I don't expect like that like like stronger care of salad yes but is it so good mm-hmm Oh cherry one's good the lemon was really good is it more sour since this lemon hmm sour uh hmm the lemon flavored one you for sure gets the sour patch quick effect it's so so good got that for you is it like sugar okay but it's I feel like it's better than like actual sour punch no this is way better cuz you got real grape also you could probably do less of the like jello packet you know sort of things I said no direct measurement I don't have to do it you just kind of like mine oh yeah I have but if you do like less jello I think I'll be good you don't need it to be like fully cooked cuz like if you see here this one has like a lot of the jello mm-hmm like sugar oh these are so good yeah you do make these please tag us on Instagram anyways we hope you guys know you soon here don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and don't forget to keep reading and I see you next video bye [Music]", "GF3FfVHO_Rc": "hi hey everybody King gamer boxer here and welcome to another video where

at home make sure you like comment and subscribe oh yeah that to like comment and subscribe there you go bye", "-Vu615e7VRw": "enjoying it alright but we're gonna have so much fun doing this yeah I've seen a long time yeah Tandy took a pool noodle he'll not cycled it to make these enchanting little candy cane lollipops so why did you do this well first if you don't know what upcycle means it means to reinvent using a different way think outside the box and make something new with it which is what we did here so the first thing that what well this first of all in stores I just want you to know I've seen them for between 20 and a hundred and forty dollars I'm gonna show you how to make them for under ten bucks apiece Wow how cool is that that's too cool okay so what do you how do you do this alright well earlier today let's roll the tape and I'll show you how I did it so first thing you get a glue gun you don't want to touch the little tip of the glue gun to the styrofoam because it'll it'll start melting the styrofoam you glue two pool noodles together I wanted to use tilt too because if you just use one the pool noodle it's the whole lollipop area just looks too small okay okay then I got some color prepaid right there okay and you put it on us it's called striping we're striping the pool noodle if you have it more on an incline you're gonna have less stripes okay okay so you want it not too much of an incline go all the way down and then you get out your glue gun and as I'm rolling and see right there that's a little tough so you might need to get some body weight in it and you're all in elting the phone there you just put a little but I want it be careful cuz yes you can I'll catch the tip of the glue gun on and it will okay then you take a PVC pipe and what it is I kind of made a mark and impression and then I got my little exacto knife cut out a little hole I dug it out super easy to do and then you get your PVC pipe put some glue on the end of it like I did right there and just pop it in and presto the way you only have to hold it for a little while until it's done okay and this is where we're at now now to take it one step further I have some cellophane here to make it look actually more real yeah so it makes it look like a real wall-e it dads like oh really eat it pick the nicer side of your lollipop and make sure that that's laying flat on the surface fold it over this way because the rapping isn't gonna look that great from the back you just wanted to look perfect in the front and then you just sort of gather it down all the way down here all the way down and what this does it kind of weather proofs it as well so if it rains or snows they're protected I mean their pool noodles anyway so they're pretty much waterproof right littlez anyway right all right and then you just take your little ribbon well would you weigh you want to do it well this is yeah this is the back we'll flip it over all right and I doubled the bows actually because this ribbon isn't extremely wide so I just made two bows and look like one big bow this go like that this is so easy I love this product this project my daughter's gonna love it she will love it and it looks so enchanting in front of your house with all the yeah we did over here how beautiful this looks with our sleigh and our present didn't I shouted at you guys no check it out powerful it is have fun with them you don't have to put them straight down either just make him a little crooked wins the call cute right I love it my daughter inspired me she had a huge lollipop on the show a couple days ago and uh you know what is a BK was hiding it yeah - Easter Valentine's Day there it is there I paid for it that night let me tell you I'm sure she ate that whole thing by the way I made it up yeah and then two days later by making a lollipop Dolly's and look at them all different colors really cute let's put it over there ten bucks and you can decorate your entire yard holiday great oh now this is well this is what we have to do we have to put a stake so it's how we're gonna put it in the in the oh you have to want yeah so we're gonna use a simple steak hammer it in ya know cuz you got to do this first and you you really want to put it in maybe twelve inches or so maybe less just really you know just shaking around and see when it's day work and then because you're using PVC pipe you just slide it on and there you go oh my gosh that's too cute done all right so directions if you want directions on how to make our craft today you can go to our website which is Hallmark Channel comport slash home and family and of course you can also visit Tanya's web site as well and Twitter or Twitter the me on Twitter if you have any questions I can help you out and then should we tweet and then I'm gonna retweet and everybody remediating okay about lollipop this is really adorable Thank You Janice okay coming up Moll Anderson will be here she's going to show us how to make the perfect thanksgivukkah which is coming up next week we'll be right back", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "PPnMcfnTalE": "what's up guys they've begin with another episode of Ella hoodie medieval today I'm going to show you how to get more grapes out of your grave time all right so this is gonna be a really quick video but what I'm gonna show you how to do is something called thinning the berries basically it's a way of pruning the clumps your grapevine once they've kind of started to fruit right after flower technically what I'm doing here is a little late as some of my fruit is already starting to ripen but you'll get the idea essentially you're supposed to do this when they're about BB size mine are a little bigger this will contribute to bigger fruit yield but also be known that most of the commercial grapes are a lot bigger because they're so packed with all kinds of fertilizers and all this stuff that's usually a little unnatural and usually they're sprayed and all this other stuff so your grapes aren't gonna be huge but they will be bigger if you choose this method so all along my trellis here it's not a trellis it's actually my carport but me being an urban farmer slash gardener mm-hmm I use what I can and so I've had this grape vine in for about two years now I actually dug it up from my old place when it was about a few feet long cut it back and reestablished it here so I'll go ahead and show you guys that so basically I cut out the bottom of this pot make sure it doesn't get weed whacked also have some Kiwi vines here but uh yeah these are our grape vines coming out here they come up one of these and we have lots of grapes trellising the entire length of my carport so one thing about training grapes most people would have a vine come up and diverge in two different directions and they'd prune them pretty short I'm utilizing all this both for aesthetic it looks pretty awesome just typing all this kind of draping down provides a little bit of shade they get plenty of Sun but basically if you see the thickness of the vine up here by the time it gets all the way around if I keep pruning this back here it'll eventually get just as thick as long as I keep up with pruning every winter and spring all right so I've already gone through a few of these a majority of them and trimmed them back but I'm gonna show you guys real quick I left some to show you exactly what you're gonna do it's really simple to your clumps to get a better yield so basically what you're gonna do is take your clumps down about half way with just some pruning shears yeah it's that simple let me show you guys so you're just gonna go about a half way up give them the snip - by doing this you're allowing the energy to be more concentrated in closer proximity to the vine which is where all the Energy's coming from it's a really simple concept but it's a slightly overlooked it's something I almost overlooked this year another thing you can do is actually thin out some of the bunches if you have some weaker ones or things of that nature anyway guys I hope this was helpful

as always thanks for watching until next time", "vRU3soOoVYQ": "welcome to another episode of the gold TSP I'm Ashley and today we're going to be making some watermelon lime lollipops I really enjoyed making the lollipops last week and I thought it would be fun to do some more we're going to be using some watermelon flavor and some fresh lime zest to flavor these I am trying to reach 2,000 subscribers by my birthday in June so if you haven't hit subscribe go ahead and hit that button now and now here's how we're going to make these lollipops the first thing we're going to get started is our candy base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already measured out into my heavy bottom sauce pan because candy making is so precise you want to make sure that you don't waste any of that corn syrup we're then going to add 200 grams of granulated sugar and 75 grams of water we're going to put this on the stove until it reaches 315 degrees Fahrenheit our candy base is heating up on the stove and it's time to prepare our candy making station once this reaches temperature it's going to go really fast so I'm going to explain what we're going to do first we're going to take our hot pan and we're going to place it on a towel on our mat we'll then add our flavorings I have one gram of watermelon flavoring and I have two teaspoons of an unpacked lime zest we're going to pour that into the hot sugar syrup stir it in using a heatproof spatula well then pour that into a heat-safe joke pour our lollipops on to our Silpat mat I'm using my macaron run because it already has about one to one and a half inch circles already on it and that's the size little lollipops I want to make but you can use a piece of parchment paper and set if you like and you can draw the template on the back of them if you want I also have my lollipop sticks ready to go [Music] [Music] [Music] our lollipops are all forward and I got about 16 out of this batch but it depends on how big you make them we're going to let these cool on the trays for about 30 minutes to an hour and then you'll be able to pull them off they'll come off clean and you'll be able to enjoy them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I hope you guys enjoy these watermelon lime lollipops they really are delicious if you have any ideas for any flavors you'd like to see me make please leave me a comment down below and I'll do my best to make it happen if you haven't hit subscribe hit that button now and like the video if you did I'll see you guys in the next video", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "m8r5Zo5xdNg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay

not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "neOErb5QOck": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the sour patch kids a lollipop with sour candy dipping powder there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "5g4H75koS4Q": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]

edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "eRrTNLNT4Qg": "gourmet lollipops they will change you from the first lollipops forged by cavemen thrusting sticks in fresh honey soaked beehives humanity has craved circular candy enlightenment and finally we have lollipop nirvana you", "dMVbD9TRqHQ": "request time people ask me what are my top five flavored liquids we've done blue raspberry in the past we've done Apple in the past but what are the flavors are people after well grape grape seems to be one that I get asked a lot about so here is my top five grape vapes 2019 I'm just gonna go through five of my favorite grape vapes they're about an easy to find at this moment in time first up we have squeezed fruit Cove great pineapple if you're looking for a very very fruity vape that's refreshing absolutely enjoyable and just all day every day let's hit the grape this is a superb one to go for it's a combination of light tropical pineapple with a rich dark grape and it really does live up to that flavor profile it's stunning it's beautiful let me get one of my max out and I'll have a little test so yes I know how it tastes I've done a review of them but let's give it a vape anyway because I love grape vapes and this is one of my favorites [Applause] I'm using a dot mod Petri like Mac and a waiter fo and mr. vapes collab the recurve RDA which has flavor RDAs go is one of my favorites this is such a well-balanced rate that as soon as you start getting that beautiful rich grape that pineapple just settles it down and balances it out and it's an absolute delight this is a treat it's a true treat of a flavor next up we've got one of my all-time favorite liquids it's from the own boy botanics range and it is the sweet water grape and white peach so like the squeezed fruit co this is a 70% VG which means yeah it's more suitable for sub phone beeping but there are mouse and lung devices you can get with this juice but what makes this juice stand out well it's just how natural the flavor is the flavor profile the combination of that grape and peach it's so so good it's so realistic that I challenge anyone to vape this and not be blown away I'm gonna drip it because I've got a met candy the flavor is so punchy and so authentic it is an all day vape par excellence it really is I'm a huge huge fan and I mean as great vape to go with to down already and they're both phenomenal so next up we have dr. frost grape ice now all of you that love a colada and icy hit this is the juice for you the benefit of this juice is that not only is it available in a 70 percent VG option but it also is available in a 50 50 10 mil option and this is why it's so great for me it's available in a 50/50 Nixle option so you can get great pipes from dr. frost first sub oming you can get it for mouth to lung tanks and you can if you love Nick salts like I do superb blown away let's give it a try [Music] authentic great with the ice hit is absolutely stunning it's fruity its juicy its delectable it's a great great juice it is grape with a nice kick it's called grape ice that's what you get you get what's what it says on the box and that's important when it comes to a lot of fruit base papers you don't want that flavor overcomplicated you want it to be as authentic as possible as simple as possible and as enjoyable as possible and that's what you get with dr. frost grape ice so this next one is for any of you candy lovers out there if you want a grape candy grape hard candy then look no further then perp perp is a great hard candy in lemonade vape and I've got to say when this came onto the market I was blown away I was looking for a great vape with that little bit extra and this was it it's 70 percent VG so again more suitable for sub own vapors but at the same time don't really self out guys there are devices for you they'll give you the options to be able to use more than one thickness ratio of juice let's give this one a go [Music] so instantly I'm getting this candid great with that lemonade kicking at the back the inhale is great heaven the excel is a great lemonade what's not to like about that it's stunning it's relatively unique last but not least we have one of our very own flavor vapor Haven fluids now this is a 50/50 and it's called grape mixed berries and it is a stunning stunning 5050 juice for all you mouthed along vapors out there this is definitely something you want to get trying if you like grape if you like berries if you like fruit then great mixed berries from The Haven Ranger fluid is definitely one for you to try it's available in many different nicotine options and it really is a stunning juice I've got it here in my Zenith tank and I can't get enough of it [Music] smooth tasty and having many different nicotine options really does make it accessible for every vapor that's looking for a 50/50 juice definitely check it out that's been my top 5 great vapes of 2019 yes some of them released last year some of them might even be older than that but these are my top 5 at this moment in time and I

so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "0bf4NtxIhNY": "hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later thank you so much and I can't wait to see you guys on the next video see you later bye", "B9ggG4QRsaw": "please ..... subscribe in our channal please ..... subscribe in our

gonna be right here [Music] so when I'm put into that zoo once it makes really good now we're gonna put it on the stove now differently slow down and just slow steady pace [Music]", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "julaE5DkP0g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as you can see by the intro we are looking at a nother juice from Moorish puffs today and it's there from their short field range and it's from their candy drops range as well and it's called grape and strawberry you saw the bottle down below now we are running this on the kelpie the kelpie rc8 I'm still absolutely enough for this tank we've got it on sniffing earth sitting on top of the vapor air so Jen we're running at 80 watts on a not 0.33 ohm coil say ready just as I hit record [Music] okay so we're going to try this now because I was an umpteenth and changeable batteries before I hit record so we're going to try this now here we go this is Morris puffs strawberry and grape candy drops here we go hmm oh yeah oh wow that's nice right before I get into what I'm tasting I'm gonna read you the description okay so let me tell ya so oh I have my favorites up so apologies for that so Moorish puffs grape and strawberry candy drops a short sale shop grapes and the succulent strawberry come together in a sweet candy for a fabulous flavor okay now on their website this is on Morris puffs website and on their

link I put the link in yesterday but I took it off because one of my subscribers private e mentioned it I've heard he I put the link in and I said I wasn't going to but without the link the website will be down there in the description below as well so what am i tasting I am tasting a buttload of sweetness this will be a coil killer this will be a coil killer folks there's no gettin around that's no dancing around it will be a coil killer okay now not so much as a bit of an extent of that the worst one I have ever tried that had too much sweetener in it was horny flavors red apple that was coated in sweetener and I couldn't vape it literally couldn't vape it but I can't put this juice down there's something about it now on the inhale I'm getting the nice strawberry flavor I don't get that I think that's where I'm getting the sweet taste from and then on the exhale I'm getting this lovely grape I'm getting this really lovely great it's a super vape there's there's no harshness in there there's no hidden nasties or anything like that and it doesn't taste chemically in any way it's just a delicious juice it really is the only thing wrong with it is it will gunk up your coils but certain juices you can excuse that you you know you can rework and re wick and REE wick if it's a really really nice flavor and I wouldn't mind reworking free three to four times a week three or four times a week to get nice flavor out of this juice it is absolutely fantastic absolutely glorious now as from as per the Nick salts this product was sent to me for the purposes of a review by Morris puffs themselves so big love to everyone at Morris puffs thank you so much for saying this true to review guys thank you so much for watching this review you guys are the best and I'll see you all in the next video bye [Music] you [Music]", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "DTG9FIY15Aw": "do you sell grapes no sorry we don't sell grapes do you sell grapes no we don't sell grapes do you sell grapes no we don't sell grapes if you ask me one more time i'll hit you with a bat [Music] do you have any bats no i don't have any baths good do you sell grapes", "oYhVNYA15pQ": "going to put my phone on silent because it always seems like people start messaging me when I press record for some reason [Music] hello folks Joey let's dipping back here for another dip review my last video the ranch seemed to go over very well everyone loved it thank you very much I was hoping you would like it I'm proud of how it came out so thank you very much for all your kindness and support just went to the store played my lottery numbers I know I'm not going to win you don't have to tell me that and I got a few tips first time I've ever seen these in a store here I've seen him when I went to like Tennessee in North Carolina and never seen him in a store here it's Bobby stalker I think now that the fruits are banned in this town that's like half the selection so I think that they're starting to like carry different mints and winter greens and stuff in place of them to fill those shelves because it's a huge [ __ ] wall you got out something so I got these only five dollars each for up here that's really good I know to a lot of you that's like ridiculous because I believe down south these are like 99 cents each not here he had to check to make sure the lid didn't fly off I also got a can of this this was ten bucks even though it's not as good as stokers I my tree review this at some point and all you want me to do the Grizzly fine cut winter green I'm going to get that next time I see it but we're not reviewing those today we're reviewing a dip that I'm excited about this was a the review I plan to do until I had to make my last one the Seneca great yeah so Seneca grape I don't know why certain parts of the scan look cracked because it's not as you can see here I have not cracked into this have not tried it that's why I'm excited because kayak grape it's just not that good it's the only real great dip you see in the stores here but if you go to one three tobacco calm you can buy all the Senecas and today we're doing the grape I'm hoping finally to have a grape dip because boat fruit it's okay not that great how about this shirt I got it at Walmart yesterday for seven bucks I think it's badass I do think that CatDog and the angry beavers should have been on this though let's crack into it crack right into that [ __ ] that's a sound you all love in that yeah it is drives me nuts when people cut cans with a knife because look at how short my nails are look at how short I cut my nails I cut them down to the skin and I can still crack them oh it's like a blurry for nose it up and take a whiff the Seneca cans are difficult to open with one can and I'm a master of it whoa that smell hit me Wow who kind of sunken down even though it's best by November this year which is better than the other ones the other Senecas I had were like June not that good this one's good um that smell though it does not smell like kayak grape one single bit this almost reminds me of dimetapp which if you don't know what that is it's a children's cold medicine I used to take it as a kid when I was sick reminds me of that but smells damn good but it's a very strong like candy smelling great can't smell it tobacco or anything like that that's just pure like grape Jolly Ranchers that's what I'm gonna say it's like grape Jolly Ranchers yeah whoo [ __ ] yeah let's crack into this I said crack into this I already cracked it let's pack a lip rather so pack a lip with me hopefully are packing something good but if you don't dip that's fine as well I had a hate comment on my facebook someone was like I don't dip but I watch your videos and someone else coming why do you watch his videos you don't do people just enjoy my videos leave him alone Jesus Christ don't be such a hard-ass cheers guys Wow God man you rack him up mudjug spitting it for the first time in my last video and my first rodeo last time I bought into my drug the road he wasn't a thing and the secret that Darcy doesn't want you to know is that the roadie can also be worn as a hat the can is very nice I like the sonica cans they are very cool-looking especially this nice and purple I like purple I wanted to wear a purple shirt for this video but I do not have any purple shirts core 63% u.s. 37% foreign and pasteurized again I believe Senecas the only pasteurized it could be wrong so weird how it's pasture has a bit okay pinches together well it tastes great I love it finally a good grape though I'm not a big fruity dipper once in a while I get some skull cherry or skull peach or whatever but I've always wanted a good great dip it's good [ __ ] this tastes really good it's like it's like it's a jolly rancher in tobacco form how can you go wrong with that oh this comparison I can't really compare oh thank you the comparison it's not like any other grape it's not at all I kayak which is the only other grape dip it is on its own it's grape Jolly Rancher no other dip out there tastes like grape Jolly Rancher the Seneca cut is weird because it has a good bad cut that's the only way I can put it it doesn't have the best cut but it's okay because it packs together well still even though it has a [ __ ] cut I can pack a nice big lip of Seneca and have it not drift a lot of people say I go it comes a FLOTUS I don't stays put texture is pretty soft one thing I admire about Seneca is that unlike kayak or long horn or even some of the Timberwolves it doesn't have that waxy texture some dips cheap that's just their waxy they don't feel like real pure tobacco and this does regardless whether or not it is pure to pasteurize oh oh doesn't burn I don't really get a burn from dip anymore anyways my gums are pretty people asked me why do you pack in the back why do you pack so far back because I noticed first of all the lip stays together better it uses out more and there's less gum recession and gaeta lip when I pack it back here that's why I do I used to pack it up here and my gums were seated like [ __ ] to the point where I didn't want them to recede anymore and yeah that's why I do that I recommend it nicotine can't be much because any cheap dip really doesn't have much nicotine and for a lot of you you consider grizzly a cheaper dip the welfare bear I can't do that because it costs like six seven eight dollars at in here so it's it's to me it's not a cheap to spit very good this stuff is very moist even though I hate that word it's very moist very wet every can of Seneca I bought when I customized my five general very fresh or at least this is good till November the other ones were like June so even though not the best dates on those ones they were still wet as [ __ ] lots of spit very dark Jesus up a lot and last ability to is pretty good with Seneca when I ordered these I didn't expect it to be that good but it's actually pretty good it lasts a while I can keep it in for probably just over an hour which is pretty damn good the aftertaste man all I taste in this I don't taste anything artificial I don't taste any tobacco I taste straight-up 100% pure grape Jolly Ranchers so I'm assuming that that's just going to stick around so I'm going to leave an ass aftertaste I can already tell you that we do have some shout outs today alright so we got the black spitter backwoods dippers laser flames ta Davis twelve sneakerhead dipper Sega Saturn game or 48 nice very nice copan skull 72 blake warner face mount gaming Levi's Brookshire Brookshire something Big Dipper seven wavy heat dips 59 and Elijah Howard check them all out or I'll kick number of subs I'm too lazy to

spit and keep cracking and packing and now it's time for the rating I'm a clumsy [ __ ] that's why I always drop my ten and I'm always like how I am this [ __ ] is good this is a perfect great dip if they sold it in stores here I would buy it on occasion probably fruit tips are occasional I do men's basically all the time unless I get Cope's enough or something good [ __ ] I like it for a fruit

media so we can stay in touch outside the videos so yeah thank you all so much I love you all keep dippin and spit and keep cracking and packing and I will see you in the next one take care", "dZ_0gc_BjGk": "hello I'm here to talk to you about the two different kinds of cancer pain most patients experience persistent pain and breakthrough pain and why it takes two different types of medication to manage them if you have pain that lasts all day we call that persistent pain your doctor has prescribed a long-acting or around-the-clock medication to treat this type of pain and he or she has probably already adjusted your dose to reduce side effects such as sleepiness or confusion however no matter how effective your around-the-clock medication is you can still experience sudden severe pain flare-ups pain that breaks through the around-the-clock medication this is called breakthrough cancer pain and traditional medications for persistent pain are not designed to treat these sudden flare ups if breakthrough cancer pain is treated by increasing your daily dose of around-the-clock medication you may suffer the typical side effects of traditional medications called opioids constipation sleepiness and confusion the goal and managing breakthrough cancer pain is to give just enough medication to manage the pain as soon as possible while minimizing troublesome side effects when your prescribed medication for breakthrough cancer pain remember that it is important to continue taking your around-the-clock pain medication every day for your persistent pain acting is a very specialized medication it is to be used only by patients with malignancies who have breakthrough cancer pain and who are already taking on around-the-clock opioid medication such as Sturridge eASIC dilaudid methadone morphine MS Contin or oxycontin every day for the persistent pain if you are already taking an opioid medication such as one of these for your persistent cancer pain and your doctor says that you are opioid tolerant then acting may be right for your breakthrough or pain it has been available for years now and is being used by thousands of patients like yourself today when you

nervous system the brain and spinal cord where it works to relieve your pain plan to finish the Attic unit completely in 15 minutes if you finish acting too quickly you will swallow more of the medicine and get less relief many patients use a clock to time themselves so they can finish within the recommended 15 minute dozing period when you use active pain relief may begin in 15 minutes it may even begin while you are taking active but you may not experience full relief for up to 45 minutes after finishing the Attic unit if for any reason you cannot finish an entire act akyuu 'not in

sure that would work out but it worked out perfectly so I thought it would be cool to use a OS capsules to move Jolly Rancher I don't know ring pops you can cover I don't know what you want to call them cos ring pops so I bought a bag of Jolly Ranchers I have four different color cos capsules here so I'm gonna try to make green I guess green apple right there I matched up with the three EOS it will be delicious then we're gonna have watermelon blue raspberry and grape dee-licious so before you do anything you want to make sure you have your capsule ready because once you heat up and I use the microwave your candies it hardens very quickly you want to make sure that you snap it back and then I'll keep in okay and I used five or six candies you can probably get away with five maybe before if that's all you have but for sure it's better to use a little bit more than a little bit less obviously and then I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time you could probably go over 20 the first time if you felt comfortable but just really really watch it because it does melt quite quickly actually maybe a total of 30 to 40 seconds so watch the ball might be hot here we have melted Jolly Rancher green apple flavor carefully carefully carefully pour it into your capsule and again it does hard it quite quickly the stuff in the bowl is already getting sticky it's hardening is you want to make sure you try to go as quick as possible if it does harden you can always microwave again and then put the remainder in your capsule so once you have that put it in the fridge or freezer and you should be good to go so when I went to go make the purple there was only three grapes my package which I tried to make work but it didn't so what I did is I melted the grapes so the three grapes that I had I poured it in and then you'll see that it actually melted two of the cherries because I had about 20 cherries that I wasn't using I guess Jolly Rancher things with everybody likes cherry I don't know so I put two extra cherries on top of the grape and then you'll see that I have to do that for the blue raspberry as well because they only gave me three blue ones so again I use some extra cherries and put them on top [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am so happy with how this turned out it's still the perfect POS shape just like hope for [Music] the feature the extra little plastic that came off supposed to be but that's fine just pops right off put it back on the lid and breathe out back here awesome a Jolly Rancher gos repot can you see their face [Music] thanks for coming to watch our video you guys this is super easy and it's really quite dummy at the end of it so I hope you guys can try it please come back to watch more of our videos make sure you subscribe like and share and if you leave a comment or get back to as fast as we can right [Music]", "e2UwbKShMC4": "[Music] [Music] you", "TuvqbUm8Y0k": "Oh [Music] so everything we're going to need is some Jolly Ranchers sugar some strawberry extract Caro syrup some grapes a measuring cup and some toothpicks and I'm just starting off by pouring two cups of sugar so we're gonna add in half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the karo syrup you want to make sure everything is thoroughly combined and then you're gonna set the temperature to medium heat then I'm just washing off my grapes with cold water and the sink nothing specific I'm doing here just letting water run over all of them and you just want to make sure that they're thoroughly dry after and I just use a napkin to Pat them dry and here's how I insert the toothpick inside the grape I basically insert it on the side that doesn't have that little hole at the top because it makes it easier and more sturdy whenever we're dipping it into the syrup in here I'm just using my magic bullet to grind up two Jolly Ranchers because I wanted to have a kind of like powdery consistency [Music] [Music] and hey I'm just taking a cup of cold water and pouring a little bit of syrup in it if when you fill the liquid and it's hard that means it's ready and if it still feels like a soft ball that just means it needs to cook a little longer in here I'm just adding in the strawberry extract I didn't put a specific amount I just put like a dash of it in there and stirred it up and you can use any specific flavor you like I just want it to taste some strawberry [Music] okay I first start off by having my parchment paper on the counter I just laid it out flat just gonna grab the great fighter toothpick and dip it in the syrup I kind of hurt my pop tipsy to the side then you're gonna place it in the cup or play with your Jolly Rancher mix and just kind of scoop it on to the grape in the same steps apply if you don't want a Jolly Rancher mix on it you're just going to dip it into the syrup and then just place it gently on the parchment paper and this is how the grapes came out guys and they were so good leave a comment below if you guys decide to make these and things for watching [Music]", "1FsgVG5zo6U": "as a whole thing to do okay we're going to try a great experiment Wow sir that the blue smells like this Ajax really please the cleaning my wife for real these are full of sugar apparently these are sugar-free that's the only thing we can determine is that is a literal sugar making up the balance of that the whole thing okay we'll see you see folks what we all work together [Music] we're gonna look are you trying to atlas or an area or I don't know I just try to get it in Wow a lot of great time okay yeah all right I am but then I was like that is the place extra poufy stay put okay the trick is not working oh well we'll get better with the color blue like a bobbin for free we're not looking for it to like my opinion right are expected that what happened it was all kind of cool though coming here in case I won through I bet it will be better so hello in the great start essentially just as around duty right now dad duty rola I haven't figured out that it was kind of nice place to just rolling around the whole like so and there it is all coated well II can't take my word for sure we recruited a boy oh you meant it's Kate I thought he might he was gonna actually like and maybe most of it I don't ever talk each ill social is a nutshell your sugar how he care hey good we're cooling it in here they're out come on you can do it why are you - oh I don't think it's actually that cold water kind of stuck together I definitely not frozen at all whole we're sort of and that bad I'm on to other kind that puckered your face try it it goes in there barely better cold mmm there might be a fuzzy ah no I was warming you", "gsp17MQ6yqU": "[Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "WjVwiaBmnB0": "all

"6TkTTZ2R4Gw": "[Music] look guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm back and we're back for another straight review today we're checking out some more grapes some more grapes this stuff is called a humble grape soda first thing I'm gonna say about it is it's kind of confusing when you go to the brand's website it comes up as great tech calyx great leaks or however you save calyx calyx great calyx aka grape soda this is another one from up north I'm pretty sure this is the second time you've reviewed their product on the show probably the third or fourth time that we've smoked it looking up the obviously we like to do our homework if we haven't smoked the strain before we're going to you know to do whatever research we can online to get as much information about the strain as we can that is correct sometimes they get information something out there sometimes it's a little bit questionable yes this brand actually a website that we can go to and read the background of this so I'll set that aside good for you guys cuz it was pure gold just hit that they're great calyx take a grape soda the long experiment that were eventually yield great calyx began in 2012 with the cross between Durbin poison and pure Hindu Kush he knew that he knew that he knew punished from the Hindu mountain from their Cowan's garden carefully a home the strain incorporating dozens of sometimes rare and unlikely hybrids sfv og Platinum Girl Scout cookies and purple pine nuts to name a few super rare I'll be honest you guys lost me right there rare and unlikely hybrid nothing more rare than boji and cookies that will more rare than that you won't find that nobody's bed oh gee cookies and purple pineapple to name a few cherry picking the very best qualities from each strain finally they struck gold swollen calluses soaring THC levels and off-the-charts terpene profile thus great talents report great calyx but on the jar it says on the box it says humble grape soda I think there's a little bit of disconnect here no website and says gree Kaling's aka persona and that's a powerful name that crack that I don't care what you say like that tell me what that smells like well that remind you is it ring available yeah we talked about this just now this smells exactly like the if you guys have been following us from way back you're gonna remember 2012 maybe 2011 somewhere in that time period when we were on the dogs walk the dogs well are you sure we have a string of you up online if you want to search dogs Walt's train review dog waltz stringer video you'll find that da WG thing yep it was I think I want to see freak or burglar cool and the treads walk across oh it's great that's what this smells like for some reason it's the closest thing I found see that it actually looks a lot like it - it tastes like it too so looking at the packaging here we were coming in 17.5% th see there you're soaring THC levels storage obviously that's not high preferred today's standards but yeah yeah up north I think this is I think this is the second time we reviewed some of their flowers on the show probably the third or fourth time we tried it what would you say you know it's your first impression of this one overall about to dress to be honest I feel like it's a weaker version of the dogs wallets that used to smoke like you said honestly it's just I think it's like some pickle show I'm gonna keep it 100 I'm not trying to dog nobody but we keep it real we're not trying to dog wall - nothing like that but you know that I mean the one thing I'll give it is it does taste really good it really does bringing out bring back that flavor of the dog's walls but like I'm just not too impressed I agree with you on the flavor probably being the best aspect of this one this is the we smoked a little bit for the wagon baked this morning this is my second time smoking it yeah both today through tomorrow I'm back in the pine so I was hoping that it would you know looks decent but I've definitely seen you know better-looking tweed the nose line I do like the smell is just not very pungent yeah it's kind of just that sweet sweet creepy I mean if you're going off of the end smell that delay gave us here and there it basically sounds like a mud run yeah it sounds like they got about 20 different strains mixed in here and they're rare I don't know it doesn't really you know really the flavor is good but it's just not no it doesn't really have any traits that really make this wheat stand up yeah there's nothing that stands out exactly it's just you know it's just it's just like something else I'd rather probably just have to something else so in this case I'd rather have with dogs wallets yeah it's grapes we love it we're smoking it it's not great being creepy though like kind of like we've been talking about lately we've actually they're talking about grapes a lot more than usual lately you know it's it's not that pungent sweet candy creepy fruity grape that I really like when it comes to like a purple you know it is it's just it doesn't really have that and it's a lot more mild right so yeah going going to the rating it I'll probably start with the taste because it's its best feature but in the same it's nothing crazy so I'm gonna have to give that like a generous eight a generous that's like the best rating I'm gonna give this this flowers so a taste longer than eight as it is producing yeah tastes are go eight look I would go seven and effect in the way it you know that could smell I probably go five yeah for bug overall I'd say this is probably a solid six and a half six and a half to seven it's a good middle show it was Shino little cheaper and not something the other better flower that we picked up like like I keep saying them the REC shelves are slim pickins right now but we're trying to bring you guys you know good strains slim pickins for everybody man have these shops I mean compared to before the regulations dad like this selection is just really really hurting right now concentrate to specialty so do anything that'll mean more interviews right so yeah it's rough out there in these streets right now yeah we're trying to bring you guys quality content for all these drainages hope we're doing that what's strange is you guys want to see us review what are you smoking on right now that's fire know in the comments if you're still watching this video what's the best [ __ ] strain or cultivar you have smoked this year and we will go hunt it down we promise we will do our best I know people want us to stop saying strains all the super wieners yep and we nerds up there want us to stop saying strain because it's not technically correct what about strands but we got strain reviews and we've been rocking it like this for eight years now I don't remember the other people to say strand from like the strand with a D on yeah man that's my favorite strand now I guess we're supposed to be saying cultivar yeah anyway doesn't sound as good it doesn't have an ice-rink cultivar is that really what we're supposed to be saying stream refers more to life and the technical sense it would be like cannabis indica and then cannabis sativa is like a different strain of the cannabis plant and there's like ruderalis and [ __ ] you learn something new every day hi guys we're gonna drag your day out please like and

haven't been on in a while so I'm coming should I get a new video and this is like completely different from what I usually do I'm doing a tutorial on these fabulous things and they are called sour patch grapes they're a healthy alternative to the sour patch candy and it's a simple recipe if you can't do this then I'm a prayer for you okay because it's like super easy then you cannot mess this up if you mess with something again I will pray for you okay it's grapes and then you know you post a wet grapes before you eat them like clean them off and a bowl of course spoon a plate and jello I chose lime jell-o because I felt like that would taste the best with these grapes so yeah let's get into the touch hottie uh I should have started from the beginning showing you guys how I did it so and look as messy like that looks horrible right now but you get just that what I did when I show you this so basically you take your grapes put them in a bowl and then you go over to the seat you fill it up with water and rinse off your grapes and pour most of the water out this bowl is stained it's not dirty it's like staying from over over time cooking things so don't think this bowl is dirty it's clean so yeah you soak your grapes it's not so cold but you know like clean them leave a little bit of water in there so don't stay away and then you take a grape excuse my nails guys I've been going through the struggle the real struggle of getting jail nails off without going back to the nail salon because I'm cheap like that sometimes like why am I paying you to take off what you did like but yeah you put the grape over here where you put the jello you put the whole thing of jello onto the plate you get a spoon and just coat it coat the entire grape to make sure all the sides are covered and yeah after you put the grape this is what you do me and these are just for me so I'm gonna touch it on the dishes but if I was making it for a bunch of people I would just use the spoon but it's just like shake off the excess because you don't want to miss and then put it over on a plate or the rest of them are and you do that to the rest of the your grapes and then when you're done you put your grapes in the refrigerator okay and then you put it in a refrigerator for about an hour or so and yeah you had to say in your refrigerator okay try one how is it", "7_McJKG1Zm8": "hey guys today's video is on how to make hard candy I'm I'm going to make lollipops for Christmas and the only need a few ingredients you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar 2/3 cup of corn syrup and 3/4 cup of water you're also going to need some kind of flavour I'm going to do cinnamon and then yours you want food coloring then you're going to need food coloring so let's get started first you're just going to need a pot this is a small batch so here is my pot I want to go ahead and put in my 2 cups of sugar 2/3 of corn syrup you're not going to get all that out so just do the best you can and then I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on medium-high then you're gonna add your water and you want to stir that up I put it on medium-high for a few minutes so this sugar can start to meal you just want to mix that up all we do now is wait just a few minutes and let that melt just a little bit get warm and I'm gonna turn it up to high heat and insert my candy thermometer okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn it up on high and you're gonna need a candy thermometer and when you put it in the pot you don't want the bottom to touch you just want it down in the sugar mixture and what we want to do you don't want to stir it you want it to get up to at the end it's going to get up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit but at 260 you're gonna add your food coloring if you want to add food coloring I'm going to add some red food coloring since I'm doing cinnamon and want to put in maybe three or four drops of that and you don't stir it up you just let it do its thing it's going to be a rolling ball and I'll show you when we get there okay while we're waiting on the sugar to bowl to get to temp I'm going to put sticks in my lollipop molds and this is the only part that I'll let mommy help me with because this is very dangerous that sugar gets up to 300 degrees and what little bit I got on my hand the other day you know it doesn't feel good so this is the only part that I will let her do because I do not want her to get burnt I don't know how many it's gonna take this candy mold works good except the the cut out part where the stick goes it's just not quite deep enough and whenever I put the sugar in there I have to turn the stick a little bit so it gets coated but that's okay that background noise is not chocolate tempering machines and they are noisy so sorry for the noise the sugar is starting to bowl so we got to wait for this to get up to 260 it's up to 200 right now and that is hot so when it gets to 260 I will put my food cart in and right back okay the mixture is about to 260 and I'm going to go ahead and put some food coloring in here and be careful it will steam do not stir it up it will mix around and then when it's done balling when it has gotten up to 300 you're gonna add the food care line and mix it up so it's gonna stir it up anyway almost 280 right now wrap for 300 just win put in this flavor right up to 295 so I'm gonna get ready and add the food coloring or shake the flavor all right open up my cinnamon hall take out the thermometer and shake it a little bit that's a pretty read or in the OL during it and be careful this is really hot it's pretty now I'm going to turn you around - all right I'm bad - pour too much it's hard to tell too much strong never done cinnamon I've just been doing fruit flavors would see that's what happens I can salvage that one on that before in his notes to me here too much the whole gram in there woof stick I didn't step to hurry times already starting to some of those need some more my toast cool and then I'll show you what they look like that is so strong my eyes are burning [Music] background on man and put it on there and just break it up into pieces [Music] I might pull that into little pieces for Billy but what I do next maybe insane I just have to put water back in the pot to clean it and put it back on stage to bowl get it from the old miser Burton and let it melt roll it that waste not some heart you consider oh and then there's some places that I can't get out hard to pizza water is really hot and let it melt too but this is what I do I might call it in two pieces but really because he said he wanted to summon some wax to make them just to put these it I don't know if they like school night spots Oh I cut it into pieces I'm not gonna do it perfect over there just getting old which is not always a perfect at all it's not for anybody been really hard it's so strong he's very emotional but since it's for really I don't care what it looks like [Music] just don't care my eyes nose still burnin so what I'm gonna do when that calls I'm just gonna wrap it up and wax paper for Billy to put in his pocket this is boring so I want to get that clean they're gonna have to clean the side on the sink so we're still waiting on these to cool they might be a couple here we go simple lollipops these are cinnamon and when you purchase in when you you cinnamon be sure to have a good ventilation I do not have that in here so there you go that's how to make hard candy most of it still shiny and we'll let it cool but I hope you enjoyed this video and got a good laugh of me coughing

feel kind of silly even doing a video on it but I feel like you know if you guys don't know about this and you are wanting some more healthy snack ideas this is a really good one to add to your pile because these are really really delicious and so what today is just some candied frozen grapes and all you need for this is some grapes which I have mine right here you just want to rinse them good and I have them in my little colander and then I just let them dry a little bit yeah but you still want them to be slightly wet so don't try them completely and then in this bowl you can use any flavor of jell-o that you would like but I have found that I like the blue raspberry or berry jell-o is the best with these and I also really like it the best with green grapes but you can experiment and see what you like the best so then you're just gonna pour some of your grapes once you have your grapes in your jello make sure you're just going to roll them around and get them all covered in the mixture and then you're going to put them in a ziploc bag or an airtight container and put them in your freezer and then you can just munch on them and they're super good this is what they look like when they're all ready to go in the freezer they're just lightly covered with the jello powder and then like I said you just stick them in the freezer and let them freeze so you want to let them freeze for at least a few hours if not overnight and then you can just munch on them and they're really good they taste like candy and Colton wants them but they're not frozen yet so I hope you guys enjoy this if you try it", "p6XPQ16221M": "some crack it was here and today we're bringing you two kids mania candy sets we have the soda can fizzy candy and the sucker punch candy lollipop this one

"UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay",

look a little bit like the currents that are pictured on the right bina bottle so you could eat them very daintily one by one but a that would take you ages to finish and be there's not enough of the flavor to go around so what the man at the stall taught me to do is to just peel off little bunches like this and you can put it all in your mouth and pull out the thicker stock the really small

cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you

of the things I ordered was lollipops these are called young earth organic hops and I'm going to be trying every single person for y'all today so yeah I'm gonna have a stripper or something they call

ascorbic acid natural flavors colored with concentrate carrot and black currant colored with organic concentrate which is carrot apple and buck current turmeric color organic and natto color vegan no peanuts no tree nuts no high fructose corn syrup made in a peanut-free facility made with no soy no egg and no dairy eight flavors it says nutrition facts are serving size is three pops and I'm trying out for all eight of so I'm getting more than two serving sizes in this oh boy how to be fun haha the seven per container is about thirteen and I really feel like there's a lot more than 13 in here to be honest I feel like there's like thirty maybe okay the amount per serving is 60 calories zero fat zero total fat zero saturated fat zero trans fat zero cholesterol five milligrams of sodium sixteen grams of total carbohydrates zero dietary fiber 12 sugars zero protein I don't think these are really cute friendly I'm about to go over my carbs for the day just trying this out for y'all this is only 20 calories per pop okay there's only 20 calories in this I feel like this is a little bit little 420 calories but I'm going to try every single for y'all it's gonna randomly grab them and try them but I am gonna be trying every single flavor it says this package material has been manufactured in a factory designed and built sleep cynical building guidelines on an equipment powered by 100% wind generated electrical energy which may not have it if the machine is made on is powered by electrical energy okay so the very first one I'm going to try that I just random to grab is perfectly peach I love peach flavored stuff like slight baked peach flavored stuff so hopefully this is good it's pretty it's got like two colors in it it's little it's round it looks like a caramel pop but it's peach it's got like this like two different caramel colors one's like a caramel brown and there's like a car mode dark brown but it's peach flavor try yep fake peach plant flavor I really like this this is if you like pate if you like baked peach flavor you will enjoy this very much Feli can you chew it do social ease permit it's kind of hydrating actually but it does stick to your teeth in that cavity filling type way where it's just like sticky sugar is attached to your teeth I mean it's candy either way whether it's organic or not it's still candy so it's so going to stick to your teeth so if you have issues without I wouldn't recommend these okay the next lever I'm gonna try is strawberry smash and this one is also kind of like two different shades of red what whoa what hold on guys what guys this doesn't taste like plate fake strawberry this tastes like actual strawberry like real strawberry flavor what yeah guy that guys that is a real strawberry flavor right there's not that is not a fake strawberry flavor that fake strawberry flavor like really gives me a headache this is this is like true strawberry flavor what again like a hydrating pool filter because it feels like I'm sorry guys it's like sour like a natural strawberry mmm definitely got that pack that pucker padge to it it's not super sour but it's not fake short way it's like pucker is like an actual strawberry it's really good it does have that hydrating feel to it and the teeth sticking gum I really like that I don't like fake strawberry but I really do like that ok the next one we're going to try is pomegranate a pucker speaking the pucker [Music] and this is like a dark red maroon color I really don't know what pomegranate tastes like I have not had it in like many decades but I'll be honest guys this kind of tastes like a cough drop laughs enjoy this tastes like a loss injure like a lost engineer without all the medicine inside it honestly I don't know what Paul McGann tase is supposed to taste like but if the other toothpaste was like they were supposed to I imagine this is I don't know how I'll contain is supposed to taste like Tomica pomegranate but it's good though it's good it just tastes like that outer hard candy of a loss injure yeah I really don't know what a pom aren't supposed to taste like but it has a hijacking feeling it has that stickiness to the teeth and it's got a pucker tight feel to her let's try very very cherry I love Martian on cherries but I've never had a candy that actually tastes like one let's see if this has that fake cherry taste to it yep tastes like a look at your lollipop it has that fake cherry taste to it like I'm you know like I'm on Valentine's Day you get those like really huge heart-shaped lollipops and you really know what flavor they are I imagine cherry because that's what this tastes like it's good though I but I like cherry flavor it's not fake or real so I should have borne more it starts the taste like by cherry and I like black cherry more than regular cherry I really like that but I'm biased because I really like cherry flavored things but to me that was delicious we four down four more to go oh my gosh let's do razzmatazz berry and I have no idea what that means but I'm assuming raspberry because there's raspberries all over the picture and that's the only thing that's on there is raspberries and it's red so I'm guessing it's raspberry flavored I think I've ever had fake raspberry they were I've only had blue raspberry flavor or mixed berry remember just had raspberry we'll see my teeth kind of heard guys has a lot of sugar three months ago this would have been nothing to me but I don't really consume sugar now that I'm on keto and Wow the yeah my teeth actually feel really heavy would not recommend eating all eight Kent all eight flavors in one sitting and if I was not doing the video for you I would not be doing this I I don't even like all these flavours to be honest okay let's try raspberry huh I guess I don't know what fake raspberries supposed to taste like because I don't taste anything let me bite into it and see if that does something cuz sucking on it I don't taste anything but I don't know what raspberry supposed to taste like only blue raspberry pepper and it's definitely got a pucker to it Wow hmm yes super pucker issue out that it was very sour hmm I'm gonna say sorry but it's very peppery it tastes like the poem I got one too I'm being completely honest um yeah that just is that the pomegranate Ameen hmm and again I don't know what Paul McGrath supposed to taste like so pomegranate and raspberry know what they're supposed to taste like but they say so same to me I may have a very big pucker to them whoa three more to go let's try one that I really am looking forward to I am love watermelon flavored things so I have high hopes for this one you would think that it would be green but it's not it's like a red and then like a reddish white pink a pink color I really thought it was gonna be green yeah definitely that really fake sugary watermelon flavored delicious I love fake watermelon it's really good to me yeah definitely yeah I really like that I really like that a lot mm-hmm Jim Monica we're gonna try the mango tango we don't really know what mingles supposed to taste like guys but I think I like it it's like half orange half yellow which I imagine this the color of a mango um there's mingos supposed to taste like orange like actual orange guys because that's what this tastes like tastes like an orange candy to me okay I think I know what the Mango Tango means okay guys I think that I know why there's two different colors this orange color is orange flavored and this yellow color is mango flavored so this is like an orange mango type flavor Wow mm-hmm and it definitely has that like fake orange soda type flavor to it it's really good I like this I like this a lot yeah I was definitely a flavor of orange and a flavour of something I've never had which I'm assuming is probably mango and if that's fake Meena then yeah fake mangoes actually pretty good and I saved at my least favorite for last I absolutely actually I cannot sense fake star berry and I can't stand fake great so I'm really glad that tasted like real strawberry considering this is completely purple I think this is gonna be fake gratefully right and I really really really do not like fake great flavor but I'm going to do this for you yeah it's most like grape kool-aid or something that I just really don't want to put in my mouth I'm so glad this is the last one oh my gosh ice I just ate sugar for 23 minutes straight oh my god yup fake grape flavor if you like baked grape flavor spot-on you will love this if you are like me and do not like fake grape flavor you will check this in the Josh this is not berry but I'm going to find someone and give all the grapes because I really don't like this big I honestly do not like this fake great type flavor but it sort of tastes like it tastes like what it's supposed to you bite into it it just really tastes like grape kool-aid yeah I would say a lot of these head pucker to him if not all I think all had pucker to them anyways I hope you enjoyed watching me eat sugar for 25 minutes straight because I did not enjoy that anyways guys if y'all want to give these a try these are the young earth organic pops they are actually pretty good I like them I just want to recommend eating eight in a row there's just no I don't know where you would get these because I got on from stock market and I don't know if they are made by five market specifically or if you can just get the or like I don't know if yummy earth is the part that makes them yeah I think it's yum right because it says your mouth calm so I guess there's a part of could call yum yum yum earth but again I got this from Thai market so anyways yeah I hope y'all just enjoyed meeting all that sugar and I

a lot of people have problems finding creeps my fingers go to the farmers market we probably could find the seed agree if you can't find the CD grape obviously you got to deal with what you can deal with if you're not gonna get no seeded grapes the next best thing to do is to get the grapes to have some kind of color you see this dark color right here this dark color they're supposed to work well on your blood now I know that the sea carries the information for the information that you need to your sail the sea carries will help but the reality is that you can't get no seeds you got to do what you got to do so you want to start dealing with something that's got the same consistency as your blood has and this dark grape has the same consistency even though it doesn't have a see it's still better than nothing so it's gonna give you something even though it's not gonna really give you what it's supposed to give me because it doesn't have a scene so you see this is the black seedless grape so you want to aim for something that's starving if you could do that right here you have the green seedless grapes so I want you to think that you got to be perfect I'm still eating because I felt a sweet tooth with my brain instead of getting a regular cigarettes there everybody good but my mainly fries here got like there and that's all the red gold Grinch not a vehicle global great or deceit a great that's really the brand that you want to look for this is right here these grapes have this season so you can see if I could get it okay can you see that seed can you see that so that has a seed in it and this is what you want to chew the seat the reason that you wanted to the seeds because it's good for your joints all right I don't need a girl for your joints that's all great but it's also good for your heart and also for your blood and even though there goes out in color it doesn't have a dark dark dark color it's still rare and still gonna be beneficial for your book so the main thing is you want to get grapes with seeds and that's the whole purpose in it to get the grapes for the seeds because this is what it help is that and you can see I've to to see because the seed is helpful for the joints I'm real active so the scene helps a lot so this is heart health this is also blood helped it's also gonna send you to the restaurant and this has something what's called resveratrol I can't spell it right now because re s v or ETA a or some light day OTO let's rewrite all a lot of people deal with it and a wine but why drink the wine would be consistent take the right here from the grape a lot of people say oh why it does me good well why nobody do you do it because it's steel alcohol so you want to just get the resveratrol right here from the grape all right this is Cochise two rocks out over get like rapist subscribe also get my book holistic milk made simple we talk about a lot of the fruits and things into cookies to get better I said I'm signing off on seeded grapes and see this greatest piece", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty

thanks for watching [Music] you", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys

Bob's medicated cannabis lollipop it's a 40 milligram THC lollipop I'm gonna be your flavored it's a hybrid by the package never had one of these before that everyone told me they're really good it's actually a pretty big lollipop can't really taste the fact that it's medicated which is a big plus for me because I don't really like the Medicaid taste and I got root beer and it really really tastes

"[Music] I'm Kelly Sonya from just to taste calm and I bet you didn't know that you can make homemade lollipops with just two ingredients but the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to match your holiday for more recipes and tips check out just to taste calm [Music] you", "lIyBuAi2kIs": "some crack I think was here and today are bringing some more kids mania candy this one's called grab pop and looking at this box it looks like we got grape strawberry and green apple flavor these candy toys are always fun so I can't wait to play with them you let me take off this plastic wrapper move this to the back right here all right one two three four five six we have two rows of six so that makes 12 grab pops here's a closer look at the green and yellow grab pop I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this is green apple let's see what happens when we press this green button Oh while it extends to club pinches it's like a jab claw here's a different color this one's pink and purple this flavor could either be great or strawberry we'll have to check out the other clocks if I down these things are so cool hey guys look I have claw hands now don't make me pinch you our last color is blue and purple I think this one's the great one and the other one strawberry hmm I wonder if it's easy to pick things up with this we'll have to try it out later let's see if I guess my flavors right there's a plastic that's wrapped around the middle here but I think we could just pull it out you gotta use a little force there we go now let me just peel this wrapper off I got one right this is green apple if you can't finish the lollipop in one setting you can just put the cap back on and you can always grab something too I was a little confused at first but let's see what this labor is I guess strawberry nice I'm two for two I forgot to mention earlier but these tastes really good put the cap back on for this one claw jab so it looks like this one's the grape one YUM I've that too many lollipops already I'll save this for later you guys ready to test out these claws let's give around the club floss for our volunteers get it hey juicy orange oops sorry yes I grabbed Twilight Sparkle easily put you back down but oh don't worry i'll pick you back up these things are actually hard to use you can't really grab them nah behind Ali oh nice I got all up in one go let's see if I can grab them quickly nope whoa skeleton guy dodge my claw jab I'm barely holding him by the arm okay I could do this that was a bit too strong sorry cheesy

this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious

gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy

candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my

and make a little edible ring pop so we're gonna crush these down I think in the bag we're just gonna break them all up it broke already so we can keep the Ring Pop and make a mold so we have a THC ring puff so here's the plan melt these down add the RSO to the melted mixture I think I can use this as a Ring Pop mold and pop it right out but let's be honest if that doesn't work I have some backup molds we'll make it work let's melt this down also I might add a little weed oil as well I know all of you guys love working with are so or distillate and just putting it right in the mixture but I love a good flower oil so we're gonna put this and then here's the weed oil obviously we're not gonna put all of this in we're gonna put some of it in the biggest thing that I would stress is to have everything all set up and ready to go you don't want to be fumbling for it and like [Music] adding some powdered sugar to the inside of the bigger who you so that we don't have the biggest lollipop ever I don't know wish me luck all right I just came up with a better way to make my mole put the powdered sugar in here [Music] made a mold always heat these up I like to put it under hot water in a cup it needs to be warmed up before you open this you just don't want to break the plungers in they're done [Music] I have the RSO sitting in hot water well that RSO is soaking in the hot water so that it blew in [Music] we can still use it well I still think we can make sure it comes to the plan one more time to ring pops we're gonna melt it on the stove medium-low more towards low watch your stone once it's melted down that's when we're gonna get that are so I'm gonna put it in open maybe just a little weed oil no once this is all melted all mixed together all the THC added I'm gonna try to pour it into those molds we mean then we're gonna try to put the ring pop back on them this will kind of take a while to melt down so I'm gonna speed it up [Music] [Music] [Music]

right now it's time for the taste test so we have our ring pop [Music] [Music] so it may not look exactly like a ring pop but it also doesn't not look like a ring pop happy medicating meltdown your

trying some of these new major drinks to the get into the store they have a a mango and a pink lemonade that have been out for quite a while but this weekend despite the apocalypse and coronavirus and everything else we got new product which is pretty cool just for something new to check out right so I tried all three of them over the weekend I actually haven't tasted this one yet but I will in a minute the first one is called sacred grape and it tastes kinda like grape soda when you shake it up and drink it I drink it kind of in like three big gulps here the old ones they had a cap on top that you would pour the dosage out but here it's more like I you each one of these little notches is 1 mil is 10 milligrams so I tend to take like about 30 milligrams so I'll drink that much this one the only weird thing about it is it's like this weird grey color but other than that I was pretty tasty I liked it grape was kind of my least favorite flavor so I decided to try that first this one is Pacific Coast blue raspberry and I like the flavor that's actually a lot better it's quite blue as you can see and there's a little bit of an aftertaste to it but it's not all that bad it's um and I've noticed with these things that it's more of a upbeat canna hi it's more sativa ish feeling to me compared with some of the other edibles that I've had and especially like the some of the chocolates that have had those tend to make me feel more sedate but anyway as I open this thing up the last one is dreamin of passionfruit and it's orange and I'm gonna taste this [Applause] I like

not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "ZM8WweZn4OE": "hello and welcome to my channel this probably isn't gonna be a long live srimant probably gonna just be a little bit I figured that you uh I live taste test just because I feel like it right whether anybody shows up or says any things completely after them don't matter anyway the blazing went to the store today and got some chips iced teas this is the tube one of them but he also picked up what you saw what some people will see in the thumbnail that I took which is sucker it is called chronic candy it was a dollar ninety-nine it's only ten milligrams high in some shop I don't think it's got THC I think it's just DVD but I really don't know I really can't say but I can show you that the receipt is from Wild Bill the last thing with chronic candy lollipop ten milligram $1.99 hey ghost like I said I don't think it's got THC in it I think it's just CBD but I figured I'd because I've had THC sucker before no biggie yeah we're in the tube top it's hot but I figured I'd do a taste test hearing a little bit I talked a little bit more about the THC one because like I said I've had a THC [ __ ] before I'm gonna point the camera down oh that's fine go don't worry about that 3i point that down a little bit more so that way you tell I'm nearing the top for anybody that pops and mumbling and forward so they don't just see from here on up and think that I'm naked okay I've had to teach this [ __ ] before and that was 150 milligrams that what my ass I don't believe this has THC in it maybe it does um I probably couldn't just call while girls and ask them but what's the point in that when I can just do a taste test for y'all and tell you if I think it hasn't if you've seen it i Cali whacker [Music] the THC one that I've had before with a pink skull you could taste the weed you can taste the granules um you could definitely taste the flavor of weed - it was overpowered by the flavored the selector which I can't remember the flavor of the [ __ ] it mostly cases like weed but it was delicious and like I said it kicked my ass it really did I was looking a half way to do that and I was [ __ ] I'd beyond belief when I say [ __ ] I'd I mean my bean I could see clearly but my eye is really really big so I figured why not do a nice little taste test for YouTube here damn slowly like this does I want to be able to taste it a little bit for this taste test and then put it back in the wrapper I don't eat it all right now so I'm assuming because it's purple hello it kind of looks a little blue so did their blueberry or grape flavored I'm assuming grape holy crap maybe you won't come smaller sucker before I start sucking on it no I can't I can't make it doesn't serve a grape I think it might be blueberry huh how do you know it's blueberry all right another isn't how you think nuts you know I like blueberry I would look at and Wild Bill's website but they don't technically show this kind of stuff on there your website um incense because I've tried looking at while bills for pipes and poles and bongs to see what their prices would be they don't even really give you prices or anything I'm not either so or have a list they just tell you that they have you know certain you know that they sell those things oh it smells good let's give it a taste George document blueberry oh my god it's just like a blueberry - my god whatever is in this is potent I mean I can taste you can taste something but the man's got ouch oh man oh you play with that money Tim I have th Tina doing this like only time Oh Graham I didn't think they'd be so mad about I know it's legal in our state now for recreational use earning Jane felon THC they had only the song CBD at Dollar General there ain't no way they're doing T C there I'm like it I could look and see if they have a chronic Candida calm I guess I will open up a new tab hmm be right back I mean you still see me but I can't see the chair real quick CBD edibles CBD oh you can get gourmet chocolate gelato OG Kush Blue Dream Blue Dream is such a good stream banana OG milk and confuses coverage or cake these monkeys a dream yeah that's EBT seaweedy lollipop you can definitely taste it Wow if you go to the website lollipops I guess they're 10 bucks apiece this was more like too much so if you get orange I guess it's creativity blue ones relaxation purple is euphoria yellow is energetic greenness focus and red is happiness with just strawberry the Green doesn't show a thing on it yellow shows a lemon purple shows blueberries grapes and oranges this one shows a cherry raspberry a blackberry and a blueberry and then creativity is it orange it's actually pretty [ __ ] good CBD nollie I wouldn't mind getting these occasional hi Megan this is really good if they have these in your state I would recommend them I don't know how relaxed I'm gonna get from this but we'll find out like I say I don't think I'm gonna eat the whole thing like right now or anything I'm just gonna stop out for a little while and then put it back that's a little low wrappers yeah opening up the wrapper in the blue my wrapper with um if it's legal in your state and they have them or even go to chronic candy calm and you can like I said you can get going chocolate with CBD in it you can get lollies like this he's in the closet like I said he likes to do much [ __ ] game you rapper demands were down in size a little bit oh yeah goes back in the rapper a lot easier than that came out so yeah I think it's good I like it um I would definitely try out some of the other flavors I would actually try every flavor just to see which one I like the most tasting and also a trial the feeling of more I mean I already know I like relaxation obviously creativity I think that would actually be really cool oh no I don't have relaxation I have euphoria relaxation would be good do I have you for you or do I have maybe I have euphoria maybe have relaxation I don't know energetic would be good to have in the morning have a energetic sucker when you get up or focus but yeah I'm sure I'll sleep fine I didn't sleep that well last night that's very very warm it's still warm today it's terrible right now but I'm gonna do joking my fan for me so I am feeling quite a bit of my fan now where I wasn't before why do you get your butt like that Domino I mean oh no are you doing I knew that you didn't you you're not getting my sucker though you can smell the wrapper you wanna smell the other side where'd the suckers kind of peeking out it there but now you're gonna be hunkered down right there staring at my sucker thinking you gonna get it [ __ ] boy it's funny like all day yesterday I told him I was like I'm not gonna touch nothing and I did I didn't bug him all day yesterday and lo and behold earlier today I was laying here and I wake up for a second to kind of turn over from how I was lean and I noticed in over on Jo side of the bed didn't say nothing tumor anything just looked at him he's seen me look at him then next thing I know I closed my eyes and I feel something on the bed no my eyes back up and look he's away from where he was closer to me and belly up like me my mission I love it huh listen my husband will miss the moment yeah so now you don't want Melvin again oh you're a jerk that's what you I call you a jerk so you start flicking your tail like a little jerk really jerk I don't know not gonna do it now a little bit of a directioner but ya know I like it I do feel a little relaxed I don't think I feel euphoric it's probably a big wall before I feel any of the effects of it I'm gonna sign him take forever I'm taking mostly because it's only ten milligrams that's the reason why it's not gonna be like an extreme experience like it was with the THC one because th Neelix I was a 150 milligrams of THC in that this only has 10 milligrams of CBD mmm maybe had about a quarter of it but I thought this was a fun and interesting taste test I will probably maybe re-edit the title of this and actually say it's a chronic candy sucker or may just leave it as just taste test I don't know yet I know I haven't been on here in a while anything new with anybody No already well I guess I will end this now Oh same ol [ __ ] same ol [ __ ] just different day yeah so that pretty much is everywhere all righty well that was my taste test um I have a two awesome thumbs up I would definitely recommend them especially if you don't want to THC but you do want something to help with like I said the different varieties of like relaxation you know to be focused to be energized like I said energy one would be good in the morning when you first getting on the focus one will be good if you're getting ready to actually go to work or because these don't have th seeing them so you're not gonna be high you're just gonna feel very uh ah hell I can't explain it I'm not a CBD oil expert or anything but or CBD expert but it it's very good the flavors nice of whatever you know um fruit flavors news they were very good man doesn't really turn your xx color like most candy then again I haven't ate the whole thing yet yes I will see you in my next video or stream whatever that is

travel in groups and get high together off lollipops that tastes probably pretty damn horrible hi", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful

are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "CyikLuf6MF0": "[Music] [Laughter] exhale my name is Michael James and I care and I'm Luke aka Walter League and today we are reviewing our has two flavors I've not tried before this is blue raspberry and grape have some great crack both good flavors yeah good eye Brasserie the same as blueberries just the Americans call it blue raspberry no I'll tell you the reasons I've tell your story behind me raspberries and sight raspberry has been a popular flavor in candy for a long time and the reason that blue raspberry is a thing and not just raspberry is because when candy makers made candy with strawberry and raspberry and they wanted something to because they're both the same color red okay they won't get something that will tell us it then what's on blu-ray yeah sure yeah oh my god that's not  divine that does smell pretty good me that's most tremendous like much puppy on steroids yeah that does not like slush puppy oh  it buy it right this is going okay I kind of wish I hadn't eaten the whole thing now very chewy hmm um edit this yeah how about I remember them having quiet abstractly it's got great texture huh no it's like had like a really soft Cuba yeah so I can light in Calgary yeah slightly powdery one bar almost kind of things I kind of show you balls rather than cheering yeah precisely which is bring episode listening to us just salivate all over these things all right my lovely tongue hey blue no ha ha ha Harley Quinn tongue going on don't think happily um yeah pretty nice oh yeah I like this good sweet pretty artificial tapetum but in a good way yeah like a lot of motion sweets they are just full of just sugar any numbers essentially but good I like it yeah I'll probably give that one like four spots and a half cuz I say one of my favorite two bars in terms of texture and flavor try the way this smells I love both great everything dude one of my favorite places could you smell that yeah when I was younger I went to America quite a bit just like South American family and stuff and great was one of those flavors I still tried when I was really young and it took a while for us to get over here so soon flavor I was associated with America's don't quite rare over here and get Welch's purple grape juice yeah that's about all wasted asking great grain don't repel you seen that sketch no I've had heard of it choking on my own saliva now if you haven't seen it it's about a black child in a group of white children and they say the references are sunny - I admire how the white kid opens the door to the fridge sees all the sunny light and all the white kids like oh my god Sunny D so needy and yeah black kids just that bad but just at the background it's probably Saul so it's probably quite racist coming from a white person but it's Dave Chappelle back yes that's fine then you're paraphrasing him that's why yeah I'm probably that's fine Adam not my chest before you're shy I'm at least possible racist person here thanks thanks I'll cut that out that's that that's an old quote his native said it was Nate Ghazi and I review and her name said I'm probably the least abrasive platon here and I said well can we all just please be 0% it's nice when Ghazi says whoa I like a calmer and I regularly drink ka drinks yeah literally the least racist person on this cart right this second I like a coma and I drink ka dreams regularly there are the mandem on the street even ordering them what's the man the man dem on the street drinking you're just giving me mystery after mystery how completely man dem is a is a street person okay you're bi say black person you know this just shows how middle-class and white I am I don't understand any of the street level I don't know I think rad is still a cool word maybe yeah they could say rad now yeah probably yeah um this is not quite as good okay I don't quite like as much I said I like it more just a great one of my favorite flavors yeah we should probably back trophy I love the flavor just a me yeah I'll give that one a very very very high three stars I'm gonna say four and a half again because it's all just sugar in a slight bit play you ever say we got fireworks for me what do i favorite G bars do bar people go yeah I said do bars yeah great now we're anti-semitic as well great brilliant well maybe we'll be like the next PewDiePie yeah that's to do them that not a yeah I don't need or spec we're just quoting PewDiePie yeah but copy you can't be a Hitler person yeah somehow thank you very much for watching who you

show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks

which are a great way to add color and height to your cakes start by preparing your work surface you'll need a nonstick surface like parchment paper but it's really important to tape it down onto your work surface so that it's completely flat because you don't want any wrinkles in it this means that when you pour the sugar onto it it will film perfectly round lollipops you can use the silicon mat instead but you also need to tape it down otherwise the cooked sugar will spread out over the uneven surface and form irregular shapes instead of circles alternatively you can use silicon molds but you won't be able to vary the size of your pops with these if you're using molds place the sticks into the molds in advance which blocks up the stick section of the mold so the sugar will only form the round disc next measure out your ingredients to make about 12 lollipops you'll need 1 cup of sugar 1/3 of a cup of light corn syrup 2 tablespoons of water and 1 teaspoon of whatever flavor you like I tried substituting the corn syrup using liquid glucose instead but the pups were cloudy so conser up is really essential for these pops if you're enjoying this tutorial please click the thumbs up button I teach online cake decorating courses and if you'd like to find out more I've put the link in the top of the screen and in the description below Sasa saucepan on your stove over medium-high heat you can stir it to begin with to incorporate the ingredients but once it starts boiling stop stirring because adding a spoon at this point can cause the liquid to crystallize instead you can use a pastry brush brushing down the sides of the saucepan to incorporate any sugar that's stuck there you need to heat the liquid to 310 degrees Fahrenheit which will take about five minutes and you'll definitely need a candy thermometer for this depending on the size of your saucepan you might need to tilt it so that the bulb of the thermometer is completely submerged in the liquid and gives you an accurate temperature the liquid must get to exactly 310 degrees because this is the hard crack stage then you want the heating to stop so have a big pot of iced water ready and after removing the saucepan from the heat plunge it in an iced water until it stops bubbling now you'll need to work really fast before the sugar cools if you're using parchment paper pour the sugar directly onto it and you can vary how much you pour depending on what size pops you want then press the sticks in immediately and add any sprinkles which you might need to press in gently so that they stick be really careful because the sugar is hot if your pops aren't perfectly round you can shape them using a round cookie cutter a piping tip or even a metal offset spatula nudging the sides gently to manipulate the shape if you find that the sticks or the sprinkles aren't sticking it's because the sugar has cooled and that's why it's really important to work fast leave the popsicle which will take about 30 minutes and then they'll lift easily off the parchment paper to use a silicon mold also pour the cooked sugar immediately after planting it in the cold water a fun way to add color to these is to use gel food coloring on a toothpick and just swirl it around after pouring the sugar into the mold multiple dip your pops are more exact round shape and if you pour the sprinkles in first you'll be able to use the part facing down in the mold as your front so the stick will be at the back where it's less noticeable you can't really do this for pops that you pour onto parchment because if you pour the sprinkles fast they'll manipulate the shape of the sugar and the pops weren't from a nice round shape once the pops have cooled stick them into your cake pressing firmly to push them into the cake but gently in case your hand slips thanks for watching I share a new cake decorating tutorial week click the red subscribe button so you don't miss one", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please

tonight just over 24 hours since five students got sick from candy that may have contained marijuana while the police focus on that parents are asking how do you talk to your kids about this right ABC 15s Mike Pelton live in Encino schools in Goodyear and Mike how are we supposed to teach our kids what is safe when it actually looks just like candy yeah and even today goodyear police tell me it appears the candy involved in all of this was a gummy covered with sugar so today we talked with a local dispensary about how to tell the difference between edible marijuana and real candy headaches were the symptom marijuana candy possibly the cause so say good year police looking into where a student got it on Tuesday before giving it to four others a typical like Apple ring you know you name it it has all different types of forms we talked to Anthony Harrington the CEO with all greens dispensary which is not connected to the incident in Goodyear and even though it comes in a form of a candy it needs to be treated like medicine so it's on the patient to put it in a safe place based in Sun City Anthony says there's a big appetite for candy infused with THC the types of patients that we're seeing that are buying maybe a little more elderly or those who are just who can't smoke maybe it's too harsh for them when they're smoking according to state law when dealing with medical marijuana products need to come with a label and warning keep out of reach of children it appears some manufacturers put it in different places this one it's on the back on another a warning comes right up top you can see the clear a distinction of the medical marijuana plant Anthony tells me these bags of candy should never end up in the hands of kids to parents he says find a case and lock it up it's medicine you would not keep aspirin now you would not keep ibuprofen out if you have underage children who may who may who see it and may take it as candy you know it's the same type of thing

TV world viral TV we're back and it's time for pot talk it is for sure we've we've been very excited and blessed to be able to have Chad from Mountain High suckers in the house if you guys don't know Mountain High suckers they've been around in the industry for a long time I remember them being one of the first hard candies so right on dad how are you man good I'm doing great nice to be here in this kind of a medium yeah I'm so glad that you're here because I will not forget your name that's helpful a room full of Chad's dude it's so easy I don't know about you but I find that like probably 1 out of 10 chats it's kind of a douche a little bit for the most of it but for the most of us I think we're go-getters this is true right I think that that ratio increases the closer you get to low dough I think when you're in low dough like 3 out of 5 Chad's reduces it is that right but down here yeah it's probably like one and 10 yeah yeah I live in Englewood so we're in the wood so give us the story Mountain High suckers so I in 2009 know became a red card holder and started doing the patient care give her a model where you could two dispensaries I would go sell really choice organically grown cannabis and kind of started to see a few edibles that were being handmade by people coming in instead of them bringing cannabis they were bringing in edibles and I know about edibles being more valuable to the body for a lot of things that people might have right so that's kind of wide we angled I wanted to angle and do an edible and got a book one night at the Barnes & Noble and I'm candy and kind of really looked into recipes and for some reason the hard candy kept coming up and right ended up being a sublingual opportunity for people for delivery right for the medicine so I remember back then back then it was I refer to it as backpacks two briefcases a lot because in a way that's pretty much all that you'd ever get back then was just a lot of the patients and their it was like gray areas still the whole industry was still trying to be figured out and you'd get approached by everything yeah and there was a lot of people trying chocalate sand brownies and all that [ __ ] that were not very consistent and then these guys came out with their mile-high soccer suckers and it not only does it the sublingually like he's talking about but there's massive amounts of flavors everybody notes you got like more of a rainbow than skittles does we do that's funny and I love yeah 25 flavors on the medical and we have four flavors on the wreck but we're launching two new flavors next month a melon flavor and like it's honeydew I think melon okay that's a green salad cherry and they're both really good so yeah that's that's pretty good cuz people always ask for cherry and you guys have always had strawberries and blueberries and watermelons and caramel apple cherry well the cherry we had prior was kind of more of a medicine e flavored one this one's really sweet so but I so I ended up making edibles in 2009 and selling them to three dispensaries and told my buddy who's my business partner now John garrison told him about I was making I made my mortgage you know last month by selling suckers at three dispensaries he's like you have to be kidding me right I'm like no and they want more that'll convince someone to be your business partner real quick yeah I think now it's a you know a big deal and so he actually joined in with me and at one point I was making oil and I learned how to make ethanol extraction oil right and I was short on cannabis for the extraction and John was doing a caregiver grower ship as well and he had trim and some herb and he bought in for like a quarter pound we say hahaha and then we got a place to grow where we're at still to this day and then January 2010 that came out with real licenses for dispenser or a mips manufacturer and right we we actually chose the mips you know to to be able to provide for colorado right in a way yeah so that was a that was a different turning time in the industry because like a lot of the dispensaries were trying to figure out if they had a good enough business model if they were producing their good their own good enough stuff a lot of them are fall of soldiers I I want to say we my first place has to be one of the one of the three that used to sell to because we would I remember the name way way way back so and I don't know in that time to be able to have to figure out if you're gonna be MIPS or just the kind of a license I I bet that would be a huge decision it was what's the difference now between those two so one is a dispensary owner type position where are you going to sell and then but you can also have a dual license which is the medically infused product license the MIPS and that allows you to actually extractions as well so a lot of companies such as you know evergreen apothecary Colorado harvest company what that's right that the the new rebranding with a harvest company Colorado harvest coming you know that was that when I talked with Ralph a long time ago when he was starting and he's like you know I think that's that's how this can be is by getting extractions out of the market more yeah and open was born and so you know it was really cool to be a part of the early startup and scene where it's gone and it's it's amazing and they look at the country it's pretty amazing the place that we would the place that we were at when you first started with in Denver it was it was seriously literally the Wild West like everybody said what a stupid [ __ ] but I mean it's so kinda it kind of explains it I always think of it as the green rush it was like the people that were in front of the wave were it was green and it was there's broad horizons do you know what I mean and moving yeah and and one of the things that I think was really interesting about mountain high suckers is since in the game since it was only medical not recreational as well you guys developed the CBD rich product that was one of the first ones CBD rich I believe or at least build that way Minoo it was we got the license in 2010 and right out of the gate patients we would meet him and they were like well how strong is this how strong is it no one was really doing it and so no one was testing and we wanted to know just out of the the opportunity to tell someone right and and then get feedback so we went to a lab that was here full spectrum was yeah so we got feedback we got feedback sorry about the mic um we took an oil in there one of our first oils and we had 13 strains in it we made like the kitchen sink you're growing a lot of varieties good salad and the lab came back when I came to up to me the day I went in and they were like so excited all these lab people you had so much CBD in it Wow and I looked at him I said what is CBD it was not above any radar except in other countries you know that have done intensive programs in Israel and in Spain and other countries so they wanted to find out what strain it was that we had that had the high CBD registration and we dialed it in through testing with them and we did we sold it for almost two and a half years so that's they called it we're calling ourselves the pioneers of CBD because we just didn't get out into the medium all right you know podcasting or anything right on the news or Time magazine well I'm a low profile back then and yeah you did you're absolutely correct we were shy because people were getting written up in Westward we were a little envious right here damned if they didn't have em ed immediately they're checking and the things were weird and so yep with our lawyers they were like be a little conservative it's not bad to fly like you guys are you're doing great right I remember my first shop was worried about advertising as well and we did in a local publication yeah I think that we kind of always started had a little bit what we amped it up at that time and within like a week or two I had a meds officer and a real police officer over my shoulders watching me sell weed to a medical patient I believe it yeah I do because it was it was Wild West breaking ground yeah yeah and the good thing about suckers I think is that you can just kind of go at it until you're good and then put it away and then come back to it yes you can and a lot of people that are receptive to an edible and haven't had any smoke maybe your you'll be receptive I actually am more of a lightweight on the edibles with milligrams and could actually put a sucker down halfway through and be like I feel something going on and it's all right you know right but desired effect of course you could finish the sucker and a lot of people are like oh I could eat like four of those but hey that's okay it's not made to be a knockout it's made for you know I think I think the medical properties of it are good one of the one there's a patient that just keeps coming into my head cuz she's such a sweet lady she comes in I don't know exactly what she has but it's definitely pain related my off the top of my head I don't know what the actual actual ailment name is but she lives and dies by it she pretty much has one in her mouth probably goes through maybe three to four everyday in a way and it just kind of helps take her pain it's just kind of subsidized that she's gotten used to it through the years you know absolutely you can build a tolerance and I think that is beneficial because a lot of other medication and the pharmaceutical side yeah you can build a tolerance to it but you can also build addictions I think yeah that's what excites me about my patients when I meet them that they're able to sometimes take away some of that medication sometimes they need them or they stand alone at with medical cannabis and a lot of them I find will have a variation of it they might like smoking in the evening or topical and then unedible so and we're glad to be a part of a lot of people's regimens today yeah for sure well where can we find more more John line you know what we're actually just redoing our webpage and it's gonna launch in about two weeks we're pretty excited okay we have one up right now that's kind of an older one mountain high suckers at gmail yep um actually that's our email the email but yeah hi

"JkdP1zO7Je4": "it's time for raspberry fruit jellies now I'm just as excited because I've loved raspberry jellies since I was a kid and the technique for making them is a little bit different I'm starting with half a cup of raspberry puree and I'll add that to my pot now to make this puree I took frozen raspberries thawed them and then I pureed and strain them so that way there are no seeds I do find that frozen raspberries work best because once thawed all the juices come out of them and of course that great color to add to the raspberry puree to balance out the flavor and also help the setting I'm adding a third of a cup of apple sauce make sure you're using unsweetened apple sauce and I'll put that in my pots I actually want to switch to a whisk and heat this up on medium heat the reason I cook on medium heat is so that I don't overcook the raspberry I want to keep that flavor so before I add the sugars I want to bring this up to a simmer now that my raspberry mixture has just started to simmer I can add the sugars 2/3 of a cup of white corn syrup and one and a quarter cups of granulated sugar so I'll whisk this while it's simmering on medium heat until it reaches 225 so that is a lower temperature than the caramels or the lollipops but I have the addition of pectin at the very end that's what gives a fruit jelly its proper consistency and you also have a nice flavor balance between the sugar and the tartness that's already inherent in the raspberry puree now it does take about 8 to 10 minutes to hit that 225 but just keep whisking you don't want the raspberry to stick at the bottom oh this smells so good it reminds me a little of raspberry jam let me check the temperature there we go I'm at 225 so I'll take it off the heat while I add my pectin one pouch of pectin this is liquid pectin so you always add it at the end of your candy-making or if you're using it for Jam your jam making process I'll stir that in and then I return this to a simmer and this only takes a minute keep stirring it there's such a deep intense color to this go I'll take this off the heat and I have my pan already prepared an 8-inch pan greased and lined with parchment I just pour it right in look at that glorious color mmm and the great thing about these jellies is they take no time to set only an hour at room temperature once they've set they're ready to be portioned these out of my container and really see the benefits of lining your square pan with parchment it's easy peel away the parchment I'll get a tray ready and I find I get 36 really nice portions from this one pan so I cut in half and then cut each half into thirds and do the same thing the other way non equals 36 squares yeah I'll just transfer these onto a tray I just love the look of these jellies and you know they have that pure raspberry flavor to match that vibrant color whenever I make my raspberry fruit jellies I have three different styles for that final presentation the first is dipping the jellies in melted chocolate now because you stored the jellies at room temperature there's actually a special way you have to treat the chocolate before you can dip them this process is called tempering it allows the chocolate to set up at room temperature and create a nice satiny finish so what I have here are two bowls in total ten ounces of dark chocolate now this is couverture chocolate designed for baking melting and exactly this setting on top of candies I've divided it up so I have seven ounces here and three ounces here what I want to do first is melt my seven ounces of dark chocolate I've got a pot of barely simmering water for melting this chocolate I want to hit 113 Fahrenheit but no more than 122 my chocolates about half melted but I can still see pieces so I know it's not near 113 yet there we go I've hit my temperature and now what I have to do is actually cool down the chocolate and I do this with that reserved three ounces and between adding the solid chocolate to the melted and the action of stirring it I can control the temperature and cool it down to 82 Fahrenheit when you're tempering chocolate you're bonding the cocoa butter molecules together that gives chocolate the strength to set at room temperature so this method of adding the unmelted chocolate to the mountain is called seeding you're seating it with the solid cocoa butter you want to keep the chocolate moving so you don't just let it sit there all right now that I've reached 82 I take it back to my water bath and this part only takes a second I want to warm it back up to 88 so the key to tempering chocolate so that it sets at room temperature heat it up cool it down and then just warm it again a little bit boy and that's as quick as it is when I take it off the heat after warming I give it one last stir making sure those cocoa butter molecules are all nicely bonded and I'll grab my jellies and the chocolate will stay in this state Dibble and tempered for a good 10 to 15 minutes so it is enough time to dip all of your jellies if you wanted to you want to just roll your jelly in there make sure it's completely coated I'm using truffle forks which are designed exactly for this activity but you can use any fork if you wish and set it down and let it do its thing it'll just set up in a matter of a few minutes the chocolates warm but it's not warm enough to melt the jelly and this really creates a nice airtight seal so your chocolate dip jellies will keep actually for up to a week or even a little longer the chocolate dipped version of these raspberry jellies reminds me of one of my favorite candy bars that combination of the bitter dark chocolate and in the sweet fruit Center mmm heaven once you get the hang of this technique of tempering and this method the seating method really is the easiest way you realize you can kind of chocolate dip anything pretzels those sea salted caramels wall there we go now while this ten ounces is the perfect amount of chocolate to dip this entire batch of fruit jellies I want to show you two other styles this next one is just like Turkish Delight and so all I do is coat the jellies in cornstarch this keeps them from going sticky so that you can pack them in a container and that look is just like Turkish Delight you do want to tap any excess cornstarch off that looks absolutely adorable so now for the final style the gumdrop style I've got regular granulated sugar and just like the Turkish Delight version I roll these in the sugar just to let them stick these candies once dipped in the sugar will only keep for a couple of days because the jellies are all-natural they don't have any setting agents or additives the sugar will dissolve and they might get a little sticky on the outside there we go so now you get the idea that with one simple candy you've got three different presentations and here the jellies are once the chocolate has set okay I will be honest I think the chocolate dipped ones are my favorite but here you have it one raspberry fruit jelly three different ways [Music]", "Wy2RNMHMS-4": "ready yet we got daddy a cricket lollipop this is the cricket on the inside that is

it was funny", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or

here lately haven't really been able to afford to buy new veep's stuff or try a new tape stuff out but uh today I'm gonna I'm gonna do something different I'm gonna module review and reviews it's gonna be on the they're called stoner patch dummies they're THC gummies yeah I live here in Illinois marijuana's legal here in Illinois now so I'm gonna do this little review on these gummies there's strawberry flavors 350 milligrams so there's 70 milligrams each I'm just gonna take a half of one because I'm not much a pothead these days you know how I was when I was a kid every teenager getting [ __ ] stoned all the damn time [Music] I'm gonna actually clean it sober for almost three years now so I really don't find marijuana to be a drug though I think it's more of a more of a medicine than anything I'd seem to do a lot of good for a lot of people so yeah go ahead sorry about this no I'm telling ya I've done some gummies before and you can definitely tell them you know if you if you get a gummy from anybody I'm telling you you'll know if it's THC or not because they smell like weed it smells like weed this is what they look like they're just little strawberries so I already got the half of one ready they got little that sugar you know just like Groening regular dummy so it tastes good what they also doesn't taste the weed so when I was a teenager if you would ever told me that one of these days you'd be able to buy these just normal mmm about a LifeCare job I mean I went to prison for something me about 15 years ago I was told that I can go up to a courthouse and get that charge expunged but I mean I got another charge too and I don't want to look at the county all right so yeah they just saw it just tastes like you can smell it so if you ever go out you buy some and order if you want to know if they're real or not smell it if you smell it I am let's novena you know you got the real thing they don't smell like we they do smell like gummies you know sweet candy most likely the their CBD gummies or theirs guys you ripped off if you cannot smell the we don't buy them so all right well I'm gonna pause this video and I'll come back in about 30 minutes and let

"YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "9fcPv4lQbvI": "like this grape sucker Andre 25 milligrams of THC at 125 milligrams last one didn't eat too much do you mean I think you're gonna strong dollars I need them super strong super super strong oh yeah I don't

fantasy ice orange e-liquid which i've been smoking for the past few days now and i've got to admit i've come to like it uh something about the orange settling into my coils now it just tastes a lot more orangey but enough about that one i'll talk about this strawberry one now which i've already poured into my tf v8 baby tank um again it's on a q2 coil i put a fresh coil in and i've just juiced it up and it's been sitting for 15 minutes now so it is ready to take a nice little tug on and i'll let you know how it tastes um what i think of it and whether i'd recommend it to you guys so let's get on with baking some now you know what i've got to give it this is another nicey liquid uh straight away i can taste the strawberries and then the ice in this as well so on the inhale you get a nice taste of fresh strawberries when i say fresh strawberries it's like the strawberry you'd pick from your garden if you've ever done that so it's not too sweet and it's not too bitter yeah i think it's just right the ice in this thing is really icy so again if you don't like menthol or if you don't like the cool taste then you're not gonna like this one either but however if you're into your ice liquids this is fantastic um i'd highly recommend this one the smoke as you guys can probably see um is amazing um it's quite cloudy so it the 70vg definitely does its job so in terms of rating this liquid i'd give it a 7 out of 10. so yeah 7 out of 10 for this e-liquid if you guys are in the market um for a strawberry u-liquid highly recommend it um i don't think they're too pricey either i think a 50ml bowl um online you could possibly get for about five fifty six quid again vaporholic is where i got these ones from so if you want to give them a little look into then by all means feel free to do so i'm not being sponsored by them and i thought just let you know where i've been buying these things from um so if you want to spend your hard-earned cash uh have a little look around and then um yeah uh strawberry or fantasy ice strawberry uh definitely a nice smoke and i'll be smoking this uh for the hopefully the next few days until the next review so night night guys and take care and oh yeah i forgot to say if you guys uh like these videos please subscribe um or at least leave me a comment i don't know whether these videos are being appreciated or whether they're absolute rubbish but i'm going to carry on doing it anyway regardless so yeah just give me a thumbs up or subscribe or give me a couple of comments and then i can take you from there it's still early days in my youtube sort of journey so any help or tips will be will be nice so anyway from that take care night night", "2l3xFaS8vOY": "I'm gonna get stoned first thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "wKefGrIaUhQ": "you know here at truebloods TV we love the edibles so today we are making our own cannabis infused chocolate bars using some semi-sweet chocolate and some cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no let's try one tastes good nice coconut oil flavor chocolate animus taste isn't

because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at

to do a real quick review on um this canyon sour liquid 50 milligram thc lollipop now if you only got a wreck if you're only a wreck user you can only get these in 10 milligrams if you got a medical card you can get them in 50 milligrams so it is 150 milligram pop i like how they do uh their little thing right there um they they do it like ski slopes like the recreational ones they're actually they're 2.5 milligrams the gummies they make they have a green circle then they have um then they have uh a blue square which is when they're like 5 to 10 milligrams and then they got the black diamonds for ones that are like 20 to 50 milligrams i've got uh these little hard candies too which are really good the canyon suckets um they're tight they're tiny little hard candies i'm really a big fan of these let me show you how small these things are right here they're tiny me see just a little tiny hard candy and that's a little thin and that's 20 that's 20 milligrams right there and it's good very good i got one of those left i'm gonna save it for um movie i'm about to watch i went ahead and bought that uh that new wrong turn this is supposed to be [ __ ] crazy it's supposed to be about a cult um they're changing it up a little bit it's not necessarily a remake it's like a it's like a new wrong turn so hopefully that's gonna be [ __ ] good i'm gonna say my last little second to uh chew during the movie and uh i'm also gonna eat me a lollipop um these are good man i've had them before i'm not gonna lick this right now because i have a uh hard candy in my mouth but you see it's nice and sour it's got the thc uh diamond right there on it [Applause] and uh you know what's cool is your colorado they're thc dot it's a diamond um that's totally from from ski culture um it's the reason why they made a diamond like black black diamonds um and uh it's just great because you know washington's got a different center symbol california's got a different symbol um now this actually most of these you know they're usually about 50 milligrams this one has 45.5 milligrams cbd it has close to three milligrams of cbd 2.56 milligrams two and a half milligrams of cbd um so yeah man it's a good product canyon i like them um they use a really good what they call cannabis essential oil which is a co2 oil and um you know i like the hashier edibles the more like full spectrum edibles definitely with the oil they use is um has a has a tiny bit of a hashy flavor but it doesn't betray the whole thing it's not distillate it's a co2 um cannabis oil which it has other things in there like the terpenes and the um you know it's the full it's a full spectrum oil it's not just a not just a clear distillate but like i said these these are very good um so yeah i suggest you try one um i've tried them before it's got a good very good sour grape flavor i'm not even a huge fan of the of uh grape but i like it i like it a lot and um i always tell you the the this batch is made with box sativa hybrid they always make it with a bulk uh hybrid or indica hybrid usually um this one right here you see it's just uh made with just bulk hybrids so sure they get like a whole bunch of untrimmed um good good bud to make their oil out of but yeah man canyon good good company and um they also have gummies too their gummies are uh tiny like these and usually they're only 2.5 to 5 milligrams they're small doses but they're little so you eat a bunch of them at a time anyway thank you guys for watching my channel um i hope y'all have a good rest of the evening i'm gonna watch my
