Start by chopping some chocolate Use chocolate chips if you have to save time However, I personally like to use chopped chocolate,  for a better looking cookies. But they taste the same Next, I use room temperature butter Melted butter will make your cookies become flat, so make sure to use room temperature butter. add granulated sugar  next is brown sugar, I use light brown sugar Mix them till combine  adding an extra egg yolk will make the cookies become chewy and rich  Pour the egg into the batter and continue to mix and don't forget to add a little bit of vanilla extract  Sift the flour, I use all purpose flour here You should add the baking soda and baking powder now, Otherwise you can add them later in each dough Switch to a spatula to combine the flour to the batter easier  Until you don't see any flour add some extra flour  As I said earlier, you can add baking powder and baking soda into the main dough If you don't, add them later like in the video is fine too. It works both ways.  Then, give this dough a little mix and you now have chocolate chip cookies dough ready to bake some flour Because we use cocoa powder in this dough,  so we don't have to add any extra flour. Same on this dough, Matcha powder replaces the extra flour  Mix till combine,  Add some chocolate chips, 70-90g up to your choice  You can scale each cookies, but scoop the dough like this is much more easier and quicker After scooping the dough, shape it to get a perfect round Same with this Matcha cookie dough Now, you can see after in the fridge for an hour, the dough become hard ready to bake Give some spaces between each cookies Next, we're going to make Lotus Cookies with marshmallows Just put some marshmallows inside each cookie dough and shape it again. Same with this chocolate dough too, super easy, right? Time for tasting  Look how soft and chewy these cookies are.

Love you all", "YgEVz5gvWg4": "[Music] alright so in this video I want to talk about the untold advice that I wish I had before taking my first psychedelic experience which happened to be shrooms so of course all psychedelics are quite different and they have different elevated aspects about them and shrooms so it seems so what I've been told researching more and experiencing the shrooms itself it seems like shrooms are pretty you know I don't want to say violent of a psychedelic because obviously if you go as far to the levels of ayahuasca or iboga mean where the physical body really has it seems to have trouble taking it in as you know we call it purging and we feel release physical anguish of release of the literal manifestation of the mental you know cognitive reverberation of it right the physical manifestation has to do something about it and I've talked to people of done LSD it seems like LSD doesn't have that as much and I'm sure dia MDMA probably doesn't have that either as it's just a serotonin dump but the untold advice of shrooms man I just want to talk about this so I didn't know that the rise was like as disorienting as it was for me so I had a four gram trip I'm guessing everything anything more than three grams will make you feel the way that I am but of course our body responds differently I didn't have any urge to puke whatsoever but I hear that a lot of people do have the urge to puke and some people actually do but that wasn't me instead I felt like I had to go to the bathroom number two style right I had to take a sheet all the time right and that was a strange thing I didn't expect that I kind of knew there would be some sort of physical like what is this substance in your stomach here you know like kind of confused maybe some that type of thing like if you eat a bad meal and unhealthy meal and your stomach's like uh I don't know about that I thought that's what it was gonna be but for me it was much more more intense and delusion alized because I couldn't even comprehend exactly what the feelings were so the feelings were like you got to go sit on the toilet but at the same time everything was so relaxed I was kind of confused as if I was already pooping myself everything my whole system my whole system and it was a very beautiful relaxation I gotta admit everything felt so relaxed that almost it felt like a wavy watery feeling and again you associate that with diarrhea and you're thinking oh gosh maybe I have to sit with so I wasn't ready for that I didn't really know but with that I want to talk about the rise the rise beyond the most strange thing I've ever experienced because your conscious state literally begins to wither away in the process the point at which you become conscious or you are conscious to the point where you're not perceiving time anymore and that's what I call unconscious but you're still conscious that transition is very very disorienting at least for me so I'd advise you to stay in a room where you're very comfortable because and not be around people - if this is your first time unless there's a trip said of course you won't have a trip sir unless the trip serves up you know somewhere else if you don't feel completely comfortable now here's the thing my trip said I felt completely comfortable with but with this rise my body was so uncertain as to what was going to happen my mind became so uncertain as to what was going to happen so everything the trip sitter said was turning into my reality and at one point she felt like she was going to you know buchen in like she started manifesting things within myself now look geez man I gotta get out of here so I had to get out of here right I went to my room and sat inside in darkness and then the trip was amazing okay but that transition of losing sense of time it's unlike anything I've ever experienced and if you've experienced marijuana a lot of times we start with marijuana and we're like ooh you know we can see that there's something more in these type of experiences but shrooms are in a whole different level and I'm sure ayahuasca is on a whole different level Logan's a whole different level of course they're all like different vibrational points in our system just in different areas you know maybe on the same level just different look man that rise is just incredibly delusional and I could not comprehend it and I felt insecure my body felt insecure unsafe you know I wasn't sure what was going to happen and everything that was once comfortable being around that person being outside was not uncomfortable or was not comfortable for me sorry so really you may have to put yourself in the ultimate woom state where you can be in a place where anything can happen where anything can happen where if there's an accident of any sort that it can happen whatever that accident isn't defined in your mind whoever wherever you are okay to express anything the random noises you know like grunts or like anything right any type of verbalization of the experience was being around other people you might start to judge yourself and then take you down a trip of judgmental paradise right it's a paradise for the judgment because it can just keep turning but it might be a negative experience and then you might have to get out of that in your own way which then is vivified right it's increased through the shrooms so the rise man that's the biggest thing that I was like people don't really talk about the way people talk about the the experience itself and people say that hey there's gonna be a rise and there's that amplification I'm just like every type of psychedelic drug has that type of experience about it right DMT is something more a lot of people describe ringing in their ears and just amplifies amplifies of all eyes and then you just Boop and you're into some other thing right short term explanation but again that rise for me was really really intense and I had to be in a comfortable state so I just advise you all to be in the most comfortable state that you can be in when taking high dose of shrooms if this is to be your first experience okay now I already think if I were to take streams again I could be in any environment I feel comfortable I understand as long as I'm with somebody else who's done shrooms and they understand that the rise is for me strange right maybe if I was out in a park I'd have to lay down and just lose sense of everything else and just focus on not throwing up or not going to the bathroom in my pants whatever it is I think I could do it in any environment but I'm not sure I would write the shrooms seem to lock me into a sense of self and I may just want to continue experiencing that in dark place I don't know dark silent in the mind where the physical body land is not really interpreted as much it's not experienced as much because again that state is very delusional for me it was hard to even look at walls because with the room stretching the room breathing when I feel warmth but the colors would turn to red warmth all that type of thing very beautiful it's literally seeing and expressing different aspects of your imagination in physical space buzz but it was very delusional or that's a better word delusional disorienting it was very disorienting so I had to be in a tart place to just cope with the disorientation that I was feeling so I advice", "QxmVguoy3Po": "Salut Emojoie here. I'm making brownie cookies today. I made 6 kinds of cookies to compare. I'd like to introduce the best recipe out of all of them. I'm using black chocolate containing about 55% cacao. I don't recommend using milk chocolate, because it will be too sweet. Either is fine, unsalted or salted butter. Dissolve the chocolate with 60-degree water or you can also microwave it. Be careful to microwave it too much. I recommend using brown sugar, but you can also make it with regular sugar too. Once the chocolate is dissolved, add it to the bowl and mix. Too little or too many nuts can be changed the shape of the cookies. 15g of finely chopped nuts was appropriate for this amount. Prepare the flour and baking powder in the bowl. The flour I used was Type45 made in France. In France, we don't really have the low protein flour such as cake flour The USA and Japan have. So I've never made it with the cake flour but I think it would be turned out the same as the one with flour. Add the chopped nuts and chocolate chips here. My recommendation is the black chocolate chips but you can also use the milk chocolate chips if you have a sweet tooth. That's the all ingredients we need. It's a simple recipe sweet. The fresh dough is soft, so wait another 15 minutes. It's easier to dish out the dough with this firm. Put the 35g dough with a 15ml tablespoon each on the plate. If you flatten the dough thinly, the cookies will be thin so you have to be careful. You can make 9 cookies with this recipe, each weighing 35g. Bake them with the regular setting. You don't need to bake with the convection setting. Let it cool down. It's really soft so please do not touch it. I just baked this one. It's moderate thickness, good taste, and mouth-watering. I had many trials and errors to make the cookies. The recipe with baking powder without nuts. It's thin cookies. The recipe with baking soda instead of baking powder. If you use baking soda, you just need half the amount of baking powder. It gets black, because of baking soda. The recipe with baking powder and baking soda. Baked just right but the problem is the taste slightly changed because of baking soda. The last recipe without adding baking powder or baking soda. I whisked the egg to rise cookies. As you can see. It gets black with baking soda. Baking soda is alkaline so it turns cacao black. It ruins the colour, taste, and flavour of chocolate. I like the traditional flavour with baking soda but I shouldn't use it for the chocolate dough. My recommendation recipe is with baking powder or without adding anything. You can make delicious cookies without baking powder. Cookies with baking powder and nuts look good and delicious. Baking powder doesn't really make the taste difference. The outside is crispy and there is rich chocolate inside. I introduced a couple of kinds of recipes today. You can save the cookies in a bag or a container to keep them fresh and it will last for 3 to 4 days. If you made too many cookies, you can keep them in the freezer. You can eat whenever you want. Thank you for watching! Salut", "6RrS4YTey6c": "hey wherever you are out there I hope you're having a great day welcome back to a brand new video intermittent fasting for beginners step number two in the first step we talked about keeping it simple starting now small baby steps nothing crucial nothing serious no liquid calories as I said over and over again in the first video we're replacing those old bad habits those sodas those juices with water once you get that down we're actually gonna go ahead and work on replacing snacks snacks could get you into a lot of trouble but snacks really do add up like anything else before I was on IAF I had horrible snack choices a lot of candy basically sugar and salt and like I always say it's the little things interests could turn into defeat feet turn into yards next thing you know you look down and look back up you're a whole football field away from where you want to work now whenever you're trying to change your life make better health choices whatever the bad options that you're eating for your snacks you don't want to just not eat those anymore you want to always replace it with something positive whenever you remove something negative out of your life it's gonna leave a void you have to fill that void with something positive or else the negativity will come right back into your life again and that goes pretty much you know for anything just life in general not just not just nutrition our eating habits so the key is finding snacks that you like to eat healthy alternatives that you could sustain that you look forward to eating every day every week every month giving a year out plain is simple you have to replace the bad with the good and the good that you replace it with has to be sustainable remember this isn't short-term this is a new lifestyle something that you're going to be able to do continually each and every day each and every week each and every month now what I like for my snacks and what keeps me going the things that I look forward to is going to be different than what you might like so whatever those healthy alternatives are that you like that's important what you like and what you see fit that you're able to sustain that's what you're able to roll with now once you replace the bad with the good you're taking those small steps in the change in your life without you even really realizing it to you it may not be nothing major in your mind it might not be may not to major you're just telling yourself I cut out sugar beverages I cut out caffeine I'm just drinking water it's not just that's a big first step and with the snacks you might tell yourself okay so I'm not eating candy bars no more that's not a big deal it is a big deal because all these things is what's going to condition your mind to get you to the main goal so when you start tackling the bigger obstacles they're not going to be so big anymore now you want to keep in mind a snack is just that what a lot of people will do is find healthier alternatives but they'll go overboard with those healthier alternatives remember too much of anything is is it's not good for you so just because you find something that's not doesn't contain as much sugar is a candy bar you don't want to eat double the snacks because then you're gonna be right back to square one that's gonna defeat the purpose that's not what we're doing what we're doing is just trying to get from one meal to the next cleaner one meal to the next better off than we were before and also just keep in mind that along the way you're changing your palate you're changing your taste buds less sugar less caffeine healthier snacks so slowly but surely you're turning into a monster you're gaining confidence you're gaining momentum this new lifestyle changes it seems so daunting anymore and once you got step one down pat by cutting out the liquid calories and just drinking water it's gonna be easier for you to make that transition into healthier options when it comes to your snacking it's all part of a plan step for step towards the goal the water is gonna help you with clean and snacking so little by little we're getting there it's all about the step we're on now we got step number one down which is the water that was the only thing that matter after you get the water down now it's all about your snacks the only thing we're concerned about is your water which you've already mastered number two is the snacks that's the only thing I want you to be concerned about let's clean up those snacks less sugar less sodium less carbs and it will go from there and this is actually perfect timing because I just run out of my snacks so I need to re-up I'm gonna take you guys with me to the store so I can show you some of the things that I like to eat in between my meals if you like the content you find a bit official you find it helpful positive or whatnot like and subscribe it means a lot to me leave your comments I'll read them if you have any questions you know ask me I'll get back with you let's hit the store up y'all so instead of the Cheetos these used to be my favorites right here instead of these I'll get these Wheat Thins my new favorites and the Wheat Thins 16 pieces is one serving so pay attention to your serving sizes that's key the carbs isn't that bad I don't have any problems with carbs I have a real little intake on carbs so I got room to spare so I'm 22 grams like on Herman wheat dance instead of these cookies and creams used to be my favorite Hershey's snicker bars now Reese's peanut butter cups man I'll get

want to find something a snack that you look forward to eating that's gonna be a good healthy alternative for you now something that's gonna be boring something that's gonna be a chore something that you're not gonna be able to to sustain so just keep that in mind until next time y'all this is step 2 beginner's guide to intermittent fasting and I know what you guys are thinking I haven't even really got into in a minute fasting yet but we'll get there we haven't got into the 8 hour window yet of in a minute fasting and this that the other one step at a time I like to do it this way it'll be easier for you when you do make that big jump to the 8 hour window because your mind is already gonna be accustomed to change your building mental toughness without you even really notice it or realizing it so it's kind of like mr. Miyagi was teaching Daniel's son Daniel son wanted to fight mr. Miyagi was was like his sensei but mr. Miyagi had him doing chores he had him painting fences Daniel son got impatient and he's like you know why you got me painting fences but I'm gonna fight little did he know that he was preparing him the whole time so you know don't get ahead of yourself take small baby steps because it's gonna prevent you from go hitting a wall and gone back to your old ways and falling off the wagon is gonna allow for you to be able to sustain this lifestyle you know much easier and trust me you're gonna love love love the results trust me alright y'all have a good day until next time come for kills be safe", "n8pE2tqG7vs": "Hi ~ I \u2019m Choco Welcome to Playing in the kitchen. Study recipes together. What I want to study today is dinosaur-shaped cookies Because I have an oven recently, I want to make dinosaur-shaped cookies. Because the capacity of the oven is large enough, it can fit such a large dinosaur model. I used to cook biscuits in an electric pot before, because the electric cooker has a small space, so I can't put too big cookie models. And this time the biscuits are more crispy. The last cookie made with the electric cooker was relatively hard and crispy. So this time the recipe will be different. But the production process is equally simple. So Is there anything you should pay attention to when making this dinosaur cookie? Let's take a look. Prepare eggs at room temperature. Or take the eggs out of the refrigerator and warm them in hot water. Take out the cream refrigerated in the refrigerator and flatten with a club stick. After flattening, let stand for 3 minutes. Soften slightly. Put the cream, salt and sugar in the egg bowl and stir. Stir until it feels a little creamy like this. Continue mixing egg yolks in the bowl. After mixing well, you can proceed to the next step. Sift the low-gluten flour into several times. Stir with a rubber spatula. When the flour is almost mixed, knead the dough by hand. Let the materials mix more evenly. Put baking paper on the table. Put the dough. Cover with a layer of baking paper. After flattening with a stick, put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. It's 30 minutes. Fold the dough. Put a chopstick on each side. Lined with baking paper. Flatten the dough. Then the height of the dough will be the same. Now to suppress the Tyrannosaurus model. Use a fork to help shape. The purpose of doing this is because Tyrannosaurus' feet are too thin. If you pick up the model directly, Tyrannosaurus' feet are easily broken. Push gently with the end of the fork. Demoulding Tyrannosaurus Cookies. Concentrate the remaining dough. Put chopsticks on both sides. Cover with baking paper and flatten the dough. Triceratops and Stegosaurus are also demolded in the same way. Print the bone-shaped mold. It's really like a fossil. Remove excess dough with a fork. Continue to make Stegosaurus. Among the three dinosaurs, which one do you like best? I used to like Triceratops, but now I like Tyrannosaurus. Preheat the oven at 180 degrees. The preheating temperature of the oven needs to be 10-20 degrees higher than the target temperature. This oven The oven needs about 5 minutes to preheat. The oven is preheated. Put the dinosaur cookies in the oven. Upper heater 160 degrees Bottom heater 160 degrees Bake for 15 minutes. It can be seen that the cookies slowly expand with time and slowly turn into golden yellow. It's 15 minutes and the cookies are ready. It's done after letting it cool. Our dinosaur cookie is done. A total of 3 servings were made. It's really not easy to make this cookie, especially its feet. The dinosaur's feet had been broken during the previous production. I later thought of the way to use a fork to assist. Although I accidentally made the production process much like archaeological digging things. Of course, it was because of the tyrannosaurus-shaped cookies that I bought the cookie mold set. When I was eating dinosaur jelly drops before, I specially picked Tyrannosaurus out. Tyrannosaurus jelly drops is eaten last. Let's try it. I'm going to eat this Tyrannosaurus. This cookie is very sweet. There will be a sense of sin when eating. It feels like a lot of calories. It \u2019s okay to eat only one slice. Black tea is best when eating sweets. Crisp crunchy sweet taste. So today \u2019s video ends here. It you like my video, press the like button.

recipe reviews and also provide fitness related content so you can stay on track with your weight loss goals i'm so excited to show you today's video today's recipe because i've been working my ass off for this one it has been over one month in the making and i'm not alone on this one we are two recipe creators i am joined by john from john sharp fitness if you don't know john head over to his channel links in the description below he is also into fitness he's also into anabolic recipes check out the other half of the recipe on his channel because there will be two videos for this recipe so be sure to check out his channel check out his videos he's got three amazing children accompanying him on his videos and he's just entertaining to watch so today's recipe is not your standard anabolic recipe we have been trying to make an anabolic version of the chocolate chip cookies like i said for over a month we took over 40 attempts over 40 batches between both of us and there is no way you can make a full-on anabolic version of the chocolate chip cookies the best option we came up with is having a lower calorie healthier version all of the anabolic versions came out just as bread they were too brave they were nowhere near the consistency of original chocolate chip cookies so without further ado let's get into making some healthier lower calorie chocolate chip cookies rolling [Music] so i laid out all the ingredients we're gonna need right here but as i mentioned before there are two creators for this recipe i am not alone on this one so i agree with john we will both be tweeting the ingredients i will show you the dry ingredients and he will show you the wet ingredients so i will only be talking about the dry ingredients on this one so what we're going to need is the dry ingredients we're going to need a vanilla whey protein powder some cinnamon some ground up oats just simple oats nothing fancy a bit of salt chocolate chips arrowroot powder and i know what you're thinking what the heck is that oh arrowroot is a thickening agent it's used when you want things to be thicker that's what she said and last but not least this is a strange one and i'm sure most of you have never heard of this this is called ammonium carbonate or in more popular terms vapors ammonia what the heck is this this is just a lemon ingredient just like baking powder and baking soda but fun fact this was the first ever leveling agent invented baker's ammonium was the first then came baking soda and then baking powder was invented so this is the oldest one in the books and i know right it's all it shouldn't work that well well my friend ever heard the saying they don't make her like they used to this is exactly the case this will provide a totally different consistency for the cookies than baking soda or baking powder like i said before this has been one month in the making i have tested both baking soda baking powder they're both combined and baker's anomaly this one will provide the crumbliness the cookies need so cookies in order to have the cookie consistency they need to crumble man the cookie needs to crumble and that's the way the cookie crumbles you can find this at walmart i can find it at any shop i can go like a two minute walk and get this off the shelf right here but in us it's not so widely used so you can either find it at walmart or order it on amazon it shouldn't be too difficult to get okay enough about the ammonium let's begin mixing the ingredients i'll start with the wet ingredients which will be presented by john in his video so make sure you go watch his video for the wet ingredients i'm just talking about the dry ingredients on this one so i'll be fast forwarding the wet ingredients we'll begin with those and then i'll be adding the dry ingredients [Music] [Music] okay so now that all our wet ingredients are incorporated it's time to move on to the dry ingredients we'll begin with the protein powder we're gonna need 20 grams of vanilla protein powder next we're gonna need 60 grams of ground out oats just regular oats that have been growled in a food processor and i know there is oat flour out there but grinding the oats worked better because of their grittiness the oat flour was too fine too powdery and it didn't provide all the crumbliness we need for the cookies next we're gonna need 0.5 grams of cinnamon powder that should do it my scale doesn't pick up a half a gram i'm just eyeballing it but you can add one gram one and a half grams if you want more cinnamon there are no rules next we're gonna be adding one gram of salt that's about a gram the scale doesn't pick it up but just eyeballing it that should be one gram and again it will not make or break the recipe if you have point five or one gram it will not change things too drastically next we're gonna be adding two grams of arrowroot powder now this you should be really careful with you need to make sure this is just two grams because otherwise it will make it will make the cookies too dry so that's about that's too much i'm gonna be taking out a bit of it that should do it like i said we don't want it to be too dry so we need to be very careful with the arrowroot it's not like the salt and the cinnamon this will actually make or break the recipe next we're gonna be adding 28 grams of chocolate chips these have already been pre-measured you can use sugar-free chocolate chocolate chips full sugar chocolate chips this will depend on your preference i use the lowest calorie chocolate chips i could find these are sugar free so 28 grams chocolate chips in they go and one floor on the floor with no problem and now for the interesting part we'll be needing 1 8 of a teaspoon of the baker's ammonium what i have here is half a teaspoon now in order to make one eighth i'll divide this in half and then divide everything in half again and i'll show you exactly how this is done it may look strange it may look like something else but trust me it's just ammonium so that's half a teaspoon i told you this looks strange that is one fourth of a teaspoon and that is one eighth that's what we're gonna need just one of these parts so scoop out let's get this off before the police start banging at the door and be careful with the ammonium this again it will make or break the recipe 1 8 of a teaspoon is very very important if you had too much of it it will taste rather disgusting because this thing is really powerful all that's left to do is mix up the ingredients now all we need to do is refrigerate this for half an hour at least and then bake it in the oven for 10 minutes and 350 degrees so make sure you preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 180 degrees celsius and we'll be baking these once they cool down for at least half an hour so in the fridge they go and we'll be back in half an hour okay it's been half an hour our cookie dough has hardened up it's time to move this to an oven tray and bake the cookies i've lined up this oven tray with a baking sheet we're gonna give it the old cooking spray treatment and you can just scoop out the cookies i don't have a cookie scoop or an ice cream scoop so i'm just gonna be using the standard old spoon it should get the job done so i ended up with seven medium size cookies this time other times i made them smaller and ended up with ten but it doesn't matter it's just based on preference you can make five you can make ten you can make 15 if you want mini cookies it doesn't matter in the oven they go for 10 minutes and 350 degrees fahrenheit okay the 10 minutes are up and here is the final result this is what the cookies look like fresh out of the oven we'll be using the spatula move them on this improvised cooling rack so be careful when taking these out because this is really hot and the cookies are really soft at this point so you gotta you gotta be really gentle with this one you can eat this right after they cool down but i highly recommend you wait for about two hours before eating them put the cookie down so here we are guys the final part of the video my favorite part is the taste test we finally get to test these amazing cookies look at that this is how they look like they came out awesome and as you can see i'm joined by my comrade in arms here john get to make a quick introduction alex this has been an absolute pleasure we've worked together across the world to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies healthier and it was a lot of fun i think we both learned a lot and uh we had a great time and the best part is we had a great product to give to everyone so happy to be here buddy and it's been an absolute pleasure awesome okay guys so let's see what are we looking at macro wise so for this for this entire batch of cookies we're looking at 677 calories 32 grams of protein 46 grams of carbs and that's net carbs and 38 grams of fats now john i know you had the time to dig a little deeper into this and you wait everything out so yeah so basically what i did is our cookies that we made about 75 calories per cookie and what i did was i weighed out each individual cookie and i basically took the average so uh our cookies average out to about 26 grams total and these babies right here let me show you are the not so healthy not so low calorie oatmeal chocolate chip cookies delicious actually featured on my daughter's channel link in my description i'll throw that right up there our cookies are more than less than half the calories of these and they basically weigh the same so um it's a great comparison weight wise and you know with our calories being less than half it's a win okay so we're not just gonna be taste testing the cookies but we'll also be comparing them to other recipes what i have here is remington james's are those i can actually see my reflection in those look how shiny those babies are these are really shiny these are the these are the cookies the latest chocolate chip cookies made by remington james the oatmeal cookies made with pumpkin the orange ones all right alex you got to give us the real deal can you taste the pumpkin in it because remington says you can't taste the pumpkin so let's let's go thank you i've been waiting a long time to test this i i really wanted to make a taste test but i finally get a chance to do so now so let's see man these are sold right they're hard to get those can you talk no no use some water my mouth is so dry right now okay so i had this concern before tasting this because baking them i thought as oh man they just got stuck okay making this i thought there's not a lot of moisture in these and that you can really see that they they really get stuck in your throat and this is a concern we also had the shininess the glossiness look how shiny those are that happens with every anabolic chocolate chip cookie out there too much protein and it just becomes this shiny and it becomes just bread they will get like a pretty cakey consistency oh man i just want to point out just want to point out to all your viewers to alex that that was our uh our mindset too behind making these exactly not you didn't want to necessarily go for the anabolic we wanted to kind of come in between and give you something that had more protein keep you on track but it held up taste wise too exactly that that was the main point of this collaboration we wanted to get a healthier version but also we wanted to get really close really close to the original these i i'm sorry ram i i gotta give them a five out of ten i'm sorry they they don't come close to to actual cookie consistency if you wanna call these i don't know maybe anabolic mini cakes sure thing there maybe a little bit more of more moisture in this and they would be fine okay guys so the moment the truth is here it's time to test the final version of the over 40 batches over a month in the making here we go taste this time all right guys let's do this let's give alex to cheers cheers cheers [Music] look at that our cookies look exactly the same that's that's that's a great sign that's an awesome sign yeah so my initial thoughts this has just the right amount of moisture and it leaves a little bit of crispiness too so that's the beautiful thing we kind of got that happy medium exactly we have a crunchy exterior and we have a chewy interior so the consistency it's it's that many it's fun and we have to sleep yeah the sweetness the sweetness is good uh if you have a sleep craving this will do it oh yeah oh yeah this will definitely do it i don't know if you can see this guys i'm gonna be making a mess here but look at that crumbliness i mean i'm making crumbs all over my laptop now but really i really want to show you guys that that's the way the cookie crumbles you know we go yeah oh you guys are going in for seconds what do you guys think you guys are cookie critiques i like this one oh alex we gotta tell we gotta tell the audience too these cookies passed the wives test of our wives tested these come on exactly they ain't gonna lie to us we you guys we found out we have the same problem our wives are not really keen on anabolic recipes so we agreed that if our wives like these cookies then they're definitely an eight out of ten out of ten they are an eight out of exactly for both of us these pass the wife test so if the wife test has been fulfilled then there's nothing to worry about mission complete nation accomplished got it all right alex well we've had a blast and we should do it again we'll have to figure out something else to do to bring it to the people definitely everyone out there give this a shot and let us know in both of our comment sections below exactly try this out and let us know in the

an intro i don't have an intro i never having to drive this problem every time the do i say it will start i didn't see you coming yeah i'm getting a little crunchy around the edges okay everybody this is the february nightclub box so okay okay i'm good i'm good i got this all right no i got this i got this i got this all right hey guys it's march but this is february's box and as you might be able to tell i already opened it and tried everything inside so this time a little bit more of a review than an unboxing but you know we'll make it work uh first thing you might notice first thing i noticed is the new box um you know we've seen them do a pride box uh christmas box this one for february black history month is partnered with the last prisoner project and it's covered with the names of people who are still in prison for non-violent cannabis related offenses which is ridiculous because i can sit here on the internet and actually consume cannabis that i bought legally and some people are still in prison for it so i really appreciate that and if you're interested in that you should go ahead and check it out but i'm just going to be talking about cannabis for the rest of this video so let's get right into it the one thing i didn't try right from the start and i tried right before the video which is currently uh you know kind of doing its thing is this hint of lemon cannabis infused thc powder drink mix by chill with l um as far as i can tell it has no chill um this is fast probably only drank it about half an hour ago and it's good my mood's elevated i'm feeling like something's going on i will say not the most delicious thing i mean i see why they called it a hint of lemon and a lemonade or lemon-based beverage or anything like that because it uh yeah mostly just tasted like lemon thc um but went down easy uh doesn't appear to have any serious amount of sugar two grams um yeah so i'd say if you if you like drinking your cannabis more than eating it and you don't like how long edibles usually take i think about checking this one out that's a hint of lemon by chill so while i'm on the topic of this one i'll talk about the other edible i got last month right here and you can see it's in the nug club colors so it's like a direct nut club collaboration with corolla and this is their cannabis infused 100 milligrams of thc chocolate dipped cookie now that's a lot that's a lot even for me the uh the packaging recommends splitting it in four and i gave it a try that way myself and i can tell you that within two hours heavy heavy effects so despite the fact that it is the ned club branded and just a single package cookie which i thought maybe meant it was like white labeled and not that great it was it was excellent it was really strong and it was a good cookie um these cannabis infused cookies for some reason always come out a little dry in my experience and this one was the same which is probably why they dipped it in chocolate um that gave it a very nice mouth feel compared to just crumbly ready thc um so i'm not sure if this is something that's going to be going on indefinitely if it was a one-time thing or if you can even find this specific cookie not through nudge club but if you have the opportunity to get it as an add-on i'd highly recommend it um i think it's probably a great value uh the only pain in the butt is of course it's 100 milligrams you got to be careful you got to split it up and it's a cookie you can like precisely divide that unless you got out of scale or something so you're going to be rolling the dice a little bit and if you get a little over eager and eat the whole thing you may be in for quite a wild ride so yeah corova nut club cannabis infused chocolate dipped cookie white chocolate by the way that makes a big difference do you okay then the remaining four items are all vapes which i've mentioned before are my absolute favorites so this boxes mix of things i'm a huge fan of i got kind of everything i wanted i got some edibles to try out see some new things and i got more than enough vapes to last me through the entire month of february i actually haven't even opened one of them so we can start there this is california diamond sauce which is as you can see a standard 510 threaded uh vaporizer cartridge with a kind of golden colored concentrate in there it clocks in at 76.9 thc with 83 total cannabinoids and it was packaged july 19th uh so not not too long from there to here um yeah yeah yeah i've gotten both a battery and uh concentrate from california before through node club and i liked both of them i thought they worked great their styles really cute if you see it's it's this very kind of colorful block printed nature inspired kind of deal so i haven't tried this one specifically i have every reason to believe it's going to be excellent um [Music] yeah yeah california sauce the strain was not given i guess it's a diamond sauce is it okay so onto things that i have tried uh this guy we've seen before last month also got a friendly farms uh vaporizer cartridge this month got a different flavor this one is cushman's which is a hybrid and it comes in at 71.4 percent thc packaged back in december 2020 and so again like didn't come straight to me but like still before its expiration date which is december 2022. now the friendly farms cartridge last month i was really prepared to be upset about it and say it didn't work i had issues with it it was trash but i reviewed their cute little literature that they send with every single one of their cartridges and it says in a big bold warning at the bottom that's red and boxed uh using a battery with the wrong voltage can result in an unpleasant cannabis experience and i would characterize my experience with this uh product as unpleasant i had it on this cobra battery which goes from three to four volts and according to this little guy you need to use a battery that is under 3 volts so i overheated it and exactly as they kind of say the oil ended up with a harsh or burnt flavor and i went to the cartridge really fast i actually um ended up seeing the fact that it was getting burnt i didn't realize why uh but if i take here's this month's friendly farms uh there was a clear like color differential showing up around the intakes little dots of like almost black city looking stuff so if you're having problems with a friendly farms cartridge or really any uh cartridge where you're seeing that burning at the bottom and the taste is off it might be the voltage on your battery and it might be a good idea to turn it down uh that said according to these guys the cartridge can even burn itself out and cease to work as well which is not something i knew could happen so learning things all the time um but this month i put it on a smaller battery one that does not get up to four volts and uh had a much better experience with it i'm still not um i'm not super impressed with the amount of vapor it puts out actually obviously it's a lower voltage so it's not going to be the same as some cartridges i can use with the 4 volts but even with that it it's kind of a weak drop but the product is really strong so that's not much of a problem i don't have a big issue like getting the dose i want out of this guy so i guess mixed feelings on friendly farms they're super upfront and they taught me something about how cartridges work but it's also a little unusual that most cartridges i receive will work uh all the way up to four volts and work great all the way up to four volts and this one was on the verge of self-destructing with that same product so if you got a friendly farms one and you have a couple of different batteries i'd recommend rotating through them and making sure you get one that actually matches up with the voltage that it needs all right now vastly less complicated are disposable so you don't have to worry about that because you don't plug it into anything and that's what we got here from leyon an all-in-one vaporizer i actually bought one of these not from nug club years ago to take with me to a music festival and i thought it worked great for that purpose it's [Music] a really cute looking unit in this orange with gold polka dots and it says lean and gold on the side one side has a hole in it the other side has a little led and the flavor was pina daydreams like a pina colada sort of thing and i came through really strong it's been a long time since i've bought a flavored vape or even like received one through node club so that was kind of surprising i've been used to sort of these um like live resin mixes and like pure distillates the diamond sauce uh those come through with kind of a plant material uh sometimes bordering on like chemically dryer sheets vibe this one definitely tasted like like a pina colada like really strongly um like if you vaped off a hit of the flavoring from like a pina colada snow cone but uh what was what made this one different than all the other ones and even some that i've got before it wasn't that strong it's actually only 55 thc but fully 29 cbd so they bill it on here as like a two to one thc to cbd ratio and i really liked that it was a very mellow effect it gave me a lot of the sort of relaxation and body heaviness that you might expect while leaving my head pretty clear to do whatever one to do um so i really liked that it was actually um i've mentioned before i always go for the disposables first when i open the box so this is the first one i went through also just because it was the weakest and i like to like sort of start low and ran my way up to the stronger ones um but i really liked it it was probably probably my favorite new thing i got i would say just cause effects i hadn't seen before and it was fun to have the flavor thing i probably wouldn't choose this particular flavor again it was kind of a lot for me um but i liked it i really liked it i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a all-in-one vape that isn't too heavy and is not going to give you a lot of like paranoia sort of things um came in this really cute metal tin and uh yeah i believe now it says liberate that's not really a flavor but a variety sometimes you get those on pre-rolls and things too yeah leon pina daydream and lastly which wins my award for coolest packaging of the whole box is this also metal really badass looking uh tin from centurion which is you can see their little logo there um now they say aim high it's our way of life so a little hard to take them seriously but assuming it's tongue-in-cheek i kind of like that vibe it's it's goofy um you squeeze the package and this tin slides open and says the clarity you've been looking for and then the cartridge was sitting in there and they've got some nice instructions on how to screw a cartridge onto a battery in case you're very confused and if you remove this uh it says head stash in this little tin so clearly they kind of want you to up cycle it and hold on to this so that's always nice in terms of the product itself what what is this well it's billed as an indica and they did not give a strain but it is fully 90 thc so far and above from a thc standpoint the strongest one we've gotten in quite some time and i would agree with that in terms of my personal subjective experience of this this is a strong this is a doozy this causes the classical cannabis experience you're going to be laughing you're going to be a little sleepy a little sedated moving a little slower so if that is what you're looking for and you want the most rapid and intense way to get there this is this has got to be one of them um i threw it on my cobra extracts battery here and you can see it's a pretty unique cartridge it's clear at the top in the mouthpiece and i've used about three quarters of it but down here at the bottom the liquid itself is borderline just translucent it has maybe like a slight tinge to it but it it it was basically a clear liquid so that's probably due to how purified it was yeah yeah yeah i don't say a lot about the process but you don't get up to 90 thc without pulling a lot of stuff out so this one moving very much uh in a different direction than these like live resins we've seen before that are trying to replicate the exact experience of a specific strain or plant this one just thc and also interestingly enough it was kind of flavored like like a watermelony flavor to it very faint um but definitely not something that felt like it occurred naturally in a cannabis plant i guess like literally this color like it tasted like this weird magenta here um but i liked it i liked it um yeah so awesome package centurion's a brand indica is the variety and it's a one gram vaporizer cartridge so this month i got one two three four vapes and like i said this one was a full gram these two half grams this guy uh 250 milligrams um in the past i've usually gotten about 1.5 grams of vape stuff split across everything so this is actually more than i usually get really showing the value in the box um i pay a little under 130 uh every month for this whole thing and i feel like just getting maybe the centurion this cookie and this diamond sauce at a club would probably cost you about the same amount so i cannot recommend enough the savings let alone the chance to try out some cool weird things um yeah yeah that's the most box thanks for watching use my referral code in the video description or probably i'll throw it on screen somewhere if you'd like to get your own box for 20 off first box only you've got to live in southern california and you've got to be over the age of 18 but beyond that check it out uh all right chill okay well wow it's like a crystal light packet live focus is having some interesting trouble with the glass i'm not gonna lie [Music] it's not uh it's definitely a hint of lemon as it says just lemon flavored weed water but like um like a lemon hit candy lemon not like a real lemon i don't know why i poured so much water said 10 to 12 ounces of liquid and i trusted them based on the size of this [Music] they're just tricking you into being hydrated there's actually no weed but you will feel better oh yeah it's organic grape and fruit sugars citric acid vegetable juice coloring sunflower lectin that's giving me the uh the mitch head break joke i met a wino and he was buying grapes i was like not yet gotta wait man [Music] are you more or less angry now that that was actually silly enough i think i'm less angry we'll check back in in uh 15 to 20 minutes", "3i_y-xYbbiY": "Gently beat unsalted butter Add dark brown sugar, light brown sugar and cinnamon Mix lightly so that the sugar does not dissolve too

these raw vegan brownies and I was hoping that nothing would go wrong but something did go slightly wrong while I was making these and I didn't want to scrap the whole video so I'm adding this disclaimer though my brownies came out looking beautiful and tasting delicious I cannot in good conscience recommend using the mixing process that you see in this video if you want to recreate these no bake raw vegan brownies definitely use a food processor for the brownie batter not a blender my blender made it all the way to the finish line of making the brownie mix but it stopped short oh my god Oh [Music] so don't try it you don't want your house to burn down luckily my brownies still somehow turned out amazing and the flavor is great so I'm still gonna review them I just wanted to throw this in you know the flavor is great the texture is decadent and I put RSO in the frosting was mine so my version contains THC 50 milligrams per brownie if it's done the way that I did mine for more about the ponies keep watching or check out the description box but please do to the potentially dangerous nature of using a blender to blend dates and walnuts do not attempt what you see in this video my one line review of the brownie recipe I used amazing but only if you have a food processor I may have dropped the ball and making flawless brownies but the chocolate frosting is super easy to make I know it would be hard to mess up the frosting I mean it's only a handful of ingredients but again I didn't want to scrap this whole video today so today's takeaway is only make this brownie and frosting recipe the same way I did start to finish if you have a food processor don't use a blender like I did or if you don't have a food processor just make chocolate frosting from this recipe and put it on other brownies or on just anything you want all you need to mix that is a girl in the spoon or whisk or a with these ideals but the process of making the frosting is almost foolproof all you

eating and reviewing one of the medicated brownies that you just saw me making and talking about but I would love to go ahead and dive into this gorgeous little it kind of looks like it's melting at this point but and then we'll talk more in a second I mean just because time to chicken so I'm gonna go ahead and eat this and we'll see how I feel in a little while Wow actually that is delicious oh my god this is so good Wow there were a few ingredients in this recipe that would I think definitely raised some eyebrows and a lot of people including myself like there's dates and this recipe that's kind of [ __ ] weird they're kind of like prunes but it's like it's like a dried fruit of sorts there's also maple syrup and like it's just kind of a weird recipe it's just like different from anything I've ever used for brownies before but these are no baked brownies and they're also kind of like healthy so that's cool all right guys so I just wanted to come on in and check in with you all it's only been about 30 minutes say my first dose of brownie but honestly guys I went in and I ate a second brownie so I ate a hundred milligrams of THC so hopefully I won't actually fall asleep as for me when I eat my edibles that I make it home it takes a good two hours for me to feel the full effects I noticed it around 30 minutes in like I'm like okay I'm starting to feel it but at two hours

montreal and i release new baking\u00a0\ntutorials here every single friday for you\u00a0\u00a0 guys so if you're into that type of thing you can\u00a0\nsubscribe down below but i'm gonna be testing out\u00a0\u00a0 this dessert i've heard amazing reviews there's\u00a0\nan oatmeal cookie crust and it's filled with like\u00a0\u00a0 this buttery sugary filling i'm so excited to\u00a0\ntry it out let's just get right into the video so the milk bar pie recipe actually starts out\u00a0\nby making a cookie so it's a basic oatmeal cookie\u00a0\u00a0 recipe that starts off by creaming 115 grams of\u00a0\nbutter along with 75 grams of brown sugar and\u00a0\u00a0 40 grams of regular sugar i like to measure\u00a0\neverything in grams because it's a lot more\u00a0\u00a0 precise but if you prefer using cut measurements\u00a0\nthey're gonna be listed down below so once it's\u00a0\u00a0 lightened in color and fluffy i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand add one egg yolk and let that cream together\u00a0\u00a0 now while that creams i'm going to measure 120\u00a0\ngrams of oats along with 2 grams of salt half a\u00a0\u00a0 gram of baking powder a quarter gram of baking\u00a0\nsoda and then you can add 80 grams of flour now\u00a0\u00a0 when i started this recipe the quantities seemed\u00a0\npretty reasonable so i only realized halfway\u00a0\u00a0 through that this actually makes two pies so i\u00a0\nended up with way too much dessert at my house\u00a0\u00a0 as usual so at least these pies are kind of on the\u00a0\nthin side because they're so decadent so they were\u00a0\u00a0 easy to eat so i'm going to press the cookie onto\u00a0\na sheet pan and spread it evenly so it can bake\u00a0\u00a0 off at 350 fahrenheit for around 15 minutes\u00a0\nnow once it's done baking the edges should be\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit browned and then it's time to blitz\u00a0\nup the giant cookie into some small cookie crumbs\u00a0\u00a0 so you can see i snacked a little bit on the\u00a0\nedges and this cookie was so amazingly delicious\u00a0\u00a0 i just couldn't help myself i recommend doing this\u00a0\nin a food processor to get a really even crumb but\u00a0\u00a0 you can also use a ziploc bag and a rolling\u00a0\npin to smash up the cookie so to reconstitute\u00a0\u00a0 these cookie crumbs into a pie shell i'm adding 55\u00a0\ngrams of melted butter to help bring them together\u00a0\u00a0 and also 15 grams of brown sugar and a pinch\u00a0\nof salt the original recipe also mentions that\u00a0\u00a0 you can add extra butter if it feels a little\u00a0\nbit dry but i didn't feel the need to so i'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to toss this all together until all the\u00a0\ncrumbs are super well coated in butter and then\u00a0\u00a0 transfer that to a pie plate i like to use the\u00a0\nbottom of a measuring cup to pack in the crumbs\u00a0\u00a0 into the corners of the pie plate so once you're\u00a0\nhappy with it you can set that aside for later\u00a0\u00a0 okay now we can get started on the filling so i'm\u00a0\ngoing to start off by melting 225 grams of butter\u00a0\u00a0 yes i know it's a ton of butter this pie is\u00a0\nreally so decadent so after that's done let\u00a0\u00a0 that cool on the side while you measure the\u00a0\nother ingredients i'm measuring all of these\u00a0\u00a0 directly in the kitchenaid bowl which is strongly\u00a0\nencouraged in the recipe to properly emulsify\u00a0\u00a0 all the ingredients so i'm adding 180 grams of\u00a0\nbrown sugar with 300 grams of granulated sugar\u00a0\u00a0 20 grams of milk powder which is milk bar's\u00a0\nsecret ingredient in many recipes 24 grams of\u00a0\u00a0 freeze-dried corn powder and 6 grams of salt\u00a0\nthe corn powder was kind of hard to find in\u00a0\u00a0 stores so i ended up ordering mine online but i\u00a0\nheard that milk bar sells bags as well in store\u00a0\u00a0 now that the dry ingredients are well mixed\u00a0\ni'm going to stream in the melted butter from\u00a0\u00a0 before and let that beat for a couple of\u00a0\nminutes after you add each ingredient the\u00a0\u00a0 recipe says to beat for a couple minutes each\u00a0\ntime to make sure it's really well incorporated\u00a0\u00a0 so slowly i'm going to pour in 160 grams of\u00a0\nheavy cream and a splash of vanilla extract\u00a0\u00a0 you're gonna let that beat again and meanwhile\u00a0\nseparate eight egg yolks from the egg whites\u00a0\u00a0 and make sure there's really no egg white left\u00a0\naround because it could possibly ruin the filling\u00a0\u00a0 so i added these one at a time until all of them\u00a0\nwere added and let that mix on low speed now this\u00a0\u00a0 rich creamy sweet filling needs to be transferred\u00a0\ninto the oatmeal pie crust from earlier they bake\u00a0\u00a0 for 15 minutes at 350 fahrenheit and they\u00a0\nshould jiggle in the center quite a bit when\u00a0\u00a0 they come out of the oven and that's it that's\u00a0\nhow you make the extremely decadent milk bar pie okay so we made milk bar pie and it turned out\u00a0\nso wonderfully i understand why this pie is so\u00a0\u00a0 decadent i feel like it's pretty much all butter\u00a0\nand sugar so i'm super excited to give this a try i understand why people love this pie so\u00a0\nmuch it's so decadent and buttery and sweet\u00a0\u00a0 if you have that type of taste where you really\u00a0\nlike those type of flavors i think this pie is\u00a0\u00a0 for you but other than that i think this pie\u00a0\nmight be a little bit too much for my taste\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a little bit too sweet\u00a0\nand i can taste some of the granules\u00a0\u00a0 inside of the filling which is not really my thing\u00a0\nbut overall i'm still glad i gave it a try and\u00a0\u00a0 the oatmeal cookie crust was really the highlight\u00a0\nof the dessert for me i really really like this\u00a0\u00a0 cookie and i think i would make just oatmeal\u00a0\ncookies with that crust it's so good so if you\u00a0\u00a0 want to give this recipe a try don't forget to\u00a0\ntag me on instagram or let me know send it to\u00a0\u00a0 me i love to see what you guys are making at home\u00a0\nand

ingredients simple to make so what you'll need is you are sweetener now I'm making this sugar free so I'm using a stevia blend but you could also use granulated sugar very cold egg whites vanilla extract crema tartar I have three different flavors of jell-o and I picked it based on the colors and I have some complimentary food colors to match each one of the flavors of jell-o in a bowl using a hand mixer with the with the whisk attachment begin to start to beat up your eggs just until it becomes foamy then add in your cream of tartar and continue to be slowly wider blending this you want to stream in your sweetener continue to beat this until you get medium glossy peaks at that point you want to add in your vanilla extract if you're going to be using more than one flavor and color such as what I'm doing then once it gets to that medium peak then you're going to want to portion out some of your meringue then add your jello powder and I'm just going to add a little bit of food coloring and then you're going to continue to beat this until the very stiff peaks form now I took my meringue and it's very stiff and I filled it with a pastry bag Nate with the large star tip and I made some stars on here now you can see they're holding their shape if they're not holding your shape your meringue was not stiff enough it should be it stiff peaks I used a plastic disposable pastry bag because I did not want any oil remnants from the previous bags that I have used with buttercream that will deflate your meringue I'm gonna bake this at a 225 degree oven for about an hour yes you heard that right when you bake meringue you want to keep it at a very low temperature and make it longer because it is susceptible to burning very fast once your meringue cookies are baked you want to have them cool in the oven with the oven off and the oven door to crack just a couple of inches and let them cool completely before taking them out and when they're done they should look like this

snacks cheats whatever you want to call them just basically days of your car lover like myself that you will enjoy if you're on keto and if you're new here thank you so much for clicking on this video I am trying to grow this channel so please give this video a like and also subscribe and hit the bell notifications because I make weekly weight loss videos and I bet apple a onto the video so starting with the very first item is this solo low carb bread this is live I love this so much it comes in two flavors at the blue line we get it from this is the go-to wheat and it also comes in honey wheat now baby-faced there's a difference between the taste he likes the honey wheat better me on the other hand I really can taste the difference but they're both really good they only have a leaf net carbs per slice of bread which is awesome and they also have a little bit constant - not a lot just a 3.5 grams of carbs I mean my cards but back so if you're eating this you definitely want to eat this with some fat products like maybe some avocado this would be great for Hakata Zoe's okay moving right along to another one of my staples I cannot get by without this stuff and their little curved tortillas now these are awesome because you can do a lot of different meals with a little car 40s and it doesn't pick a lot now this brand particularly is 5 grams of net carbs per per tortilla and this is vegan friendly so anyone and everyone can eat this here is another option this is the mission card balance and I didn't take the brand for the other one I'll link everything in the description box below though so you guys can check that out but yeah this is another option now this is for net grams of carbs per tortilla this is really good as well you know for burritos quesadillas fajitas even okay so the moment you've all been waiting for the sweet stuff now before I talk about some of the things that we bought like desserts and stuff for keto I'm going to talk about some of the stuff that you can have in your pantry so you can make keto desserts that's what babe normally does he likes to make keto desserts find recipes on YouTube there's a whole bunch of them out there I was trying to link some of our favorites in the description box below so you can check those out but these are some of those essentials you will need aren't you're going to need a nut flour I hate how my brain works sometimes but you're gonna need a flower that's based off of a nut such as almond flour or coconut flour now we particularly particularly particularly Oh Tonga come up here we prefer this is an almond flour versus coconut flour because the coconut flour does have a coconut each type of taste but if that's your thing then by all means go for a coconut flour but we use the almond flour now this has about one gram of Nick Carr so this is awesome per 3 tablespoons but you do have to be careful with this especially since the serving size it's only 3 TSP so make sure when you're measuring this out that you're not going over your allotted amount of calories for today and it does have 7 grams of fat so that's pretty awesome how to the coconut flour we're looking at 10 grams of carbs 2 grams of fat and 2 grams of protein per serving and it's two tablespoons per serving so again just be mindful of how much you're using and make sure you're calculating your car's out properly you should be fine but this is a awesome flour substitute now moving right on to my favorite sweet that we looked up to find as you may know in Akita bag you can home sugar which is okay because we now live in a day and age where zero sugar zero calorie sweeteners are more plentiful I guess this is the one we like swerve now they just happened upon this in a few videos who saw on YouTube and we saw it in the store and he picked it up and I'm so grateful and this is awesome because not only is there zero calories in this there are zero carbs well zero net carbs I should say which is awesome you can put it in any and everything we normally bake with this when we make keto desserts and stuff that's normally what we use it for but I see you're using this and maybe like your teeth if you want to sweeten if you drink a little bit I can see you doing see it going in there I haven't tried that I said yet but the best thing on the back that you can't add it to beverages too so let's keep that in mind if you're looking for a good sweetener get this you will not be disappointed I promise okay now for the finale the good stuff now let's start off only have two that I want to show you guys because I want to show you these for different reasons now this item keto cookies I have some mixed reviews about this so let's start with the pros first this is a dessert that's already made so you don't have to do any prep work you don't have to go ahead it backwards the whole time sorry about that but yeah this is a dessert that you don't have to make you don't have to worry about buying ingredients for it's already ready to go in a package you just get right and there's only three net carbs per cookie and for the most part there are some really good ingredients in here most of the things I can't pronounce which is a 1 there's also 15 grams of fat which is awesome and a a protein which is pretty good too let's move on to the cons uh I don't like it you know you do have to adjust your expectations of certain prepackaged districts like this or even the dissociate making your home they're not going to taste exactly like the other desserts or maybe a custom tune you know the ones made the rose by our real sugar but even with that in mind there there's a lot to take in with this so uh what I recommended yes because you know there's something for everybody and this may be your judge I was just recommend if you don't eat this often this is just something to hold you over to you get to your cheat day if you do have cheat days on keto or if you do strictly keto all the time and this made me a nice little stand and for dessert if you don't feel like prepping a dessert for that night on to the very last thing I have to show you guys I'm actually excited about this because we just found this yesterday like I'm filming this I think was I can't wait for it maybe you don't quote me on that but we literally just found this yesterday now I have to show you this in two pieces because I did eat it last night so yeah don't don't judge me for about for the presentation but it is these Duncan Hines kiddo friendly mug cakes that's the only way I can explain it the title does say Duncan Hines keto friendly birthday cake mix on this little container hi guys okay so let me break this down for you when I first saw this on this shelf I was a little wary because for a cake to only have five net grants with the carbs you didn't make it at home this a little look as you saw with the flour and stuff it was anywhere between three to two net carbs per three teaspoons and there's more than three teaspoons of stuff in here so I was a little weary on that but after looking at the back I understand or understood why it's because of their ingredients they have up here now as far as the other stuff they do have 14 grams of fat which is awesome for keto and 9 grams of protein now this is a great Pacific I like it a lot now it's not going to taste like a cake that you're used to it has regular flour and sugar in it however it is a very good substitute now what I will say about this is it is um 300 calories per serving so you definitely don't want to consume too many of these this is just a every once in a while type of snack and then you have dinner flavor so if you're not so keen on birthday cake mix no worries they got you I forgot all the flavors they offered but I remember seeing something about double chocolate but I definitely check out your local grocery store in the cake aisle we found this at Walmart so definitely check that out if you're interested so yeah that's the end of my list for my Aikido friendly car substitutes for car lovers list if I find anything else out there that I think will be a great addition to this list I would definitely put it on my social media you guys can follow me at for every bag on Instagram and that's where I'm at when I'm not here on YouTube I'm posting over there almost every day so

"6JiEgkilrEk": "this is the video for mixture problems this is section 2.8 and for mixture problems our problems that are two or more parts are combining into a hole delectable cookie company sells cookie chocolate chip cookies for 6.95 so on here on your matrix what you're going to do is put the price per pound at 6.95 and sugar cookers for 5.95 how many pounds of chocolate chip so we need to know that this is the variable since that's your in question is how many pounds of chocolate chip that means that the w goes right here the number of pounds of chocolate chip will represent the w and should be mixed with four pounds so four pounds of sugar cookies to combine a mixture that sells at 6.75 so to combine the mixture you need to put the chocolate chip cookie mix and the sugar cookie mixed together well how do you get the total prices you're going to multiply them that's w times 6.95 4 times 5.95 and w plus 4 times 6.75 to solve the problem what we're going to do is set the equation p times 6.95 plus 4 [Music] times 5 5.95 and that's equal to so these two parts equal together should give you the mixture of w plus 4 times 6.75 and we're going to go ahead and do the multiplication we got 6.95 p plus and then 4 times 5.95 becomes 3 23.8 and that's equal to and then we're going to do the distributive property that means 6 times w is going to give you 6.75 w plus and then 4 times 6.75 is 27. i'm going to subtract that 6.7 w from both sides 6.75 to w sorry and i put a p over here i'm sorry that's supposed to be a w and the reason that i notice is because my letters wouldn't line up and then i'm going to subtract the 23.8 from this side minus 23.8 i'm left with 0.2 p is equal to 3.2 then divide by 0.2 to both sides i'm not sure why keep doing that sorry w w is equal to 16. that means that w is equal to 16 pounds of chocolate chip cookies should be mixed with four pounds of sugar cookies to get that mixture okay so the next one i have set up and it's the first problem we're going to do the the grocery store has two kinds of candy sugar candy sells for 155 per pound so the price per pound at 155 and the sugar-free candy sells for 295 295 per pound how many pounds of sugar-free so that's where i got my w the the number of pounds of sugar-free candy w should be added to 15 pounds of sugar candy oh so right here's the 15 pounds of sugar candy to make a mixture that sells for 175 so put these two together that's 15 plus w we multiply the sides out and then together it's supposed to equal to this so 15 times 1.5 gives you that 23.25 w times 2.95 we just rewrite as 2.95 w then we do the distributive property that's 15 times 1.75 gives you 26.25 and 1.75 times w is the negative 1.5 w from here i eliminate this from this side and that means i have to subtract 23.25 from both sides and then i eliminate that negative that 1.75 w that means i have to subtract it from both sides i'm left with 1.2 w is equal to 3 then you divide by 1.2 that means that 2.3 pounds of sugar-free candy need to be added to the mixture to get you the price of 175 per pound okay then number two we're gonna help you fill it in it says you want to make a halloween party mix so this is a party mix with popcorn and pretzels so we're gonna put popcorn here and pretzels here to sell for a fundraiser popcorn costs a dollar ten per pound so this is price per per pound and the popcorn sells at 110 and the pretzels cost 149 per pound how many pounds of popcorn so x will be the number of popcorn [Music] that means that this will be our x and that means that this title is the number of pounds must be added to four pounds of pretzels so four pounds of pretzels to get our mixture we're gonna add those two together and it has to sell for a dollar twenty-five and then on here we got our total price we got to multiply these things x times 1.10 4 times 1.49 and x plus 4 times 1.25 that means our equation is going to be set up as 1.1 x that means the same thing plus and i'm going to go ahead and multiply these out 4 times 1.29 1.2949 it's 5.96 5.96 is equal to and we've got to multiply this to the x gives you 1.25 x and then 4 times 1 25 oops one and clear that four times 1.25 is equal to five we're going to subtract 1.25 from this side to cancel out here we're going to subtract 5.96 from both sides to cancel it out here 1.1 minus 1.25 is equal to a negative point 15 x 5 minus 5.96 is equal to a negative point ninety six divide by negative point fifteen of both sides x is equal to so divided by a negative 0.15 6.4 that means that we need 6.4 pounds of popcorn to be added to our mixture of four pounds of pretzels number three and a nursery sells kentucky kentucky blue grass seeds for so we're talking about seeds we got a kentucky blue grass and so we know we have to deal with number of pounds this is price per pound and this one equals 575 and total price is what we're going to have to fill in later and then tall grass seeds for 450 fescue um the nursery sells a mixture of the two kinds of seeds for 525 so that's your mixture let k represent the amount of kentucky blue so this would be k and the nursery uses five pounds of the mixture uses five pounds of the mixture so we need to figure out how much of this the tall grass that they need and but we know that five is the total so we're going to do 5 minus k this time to get the rest so 5 minus the kentucky would give you what's left of the tall grass we multiply this out we have 5.75 k um i'm going to write it as 5 minus k times 4.5 and then 5 times uh 5.25 is equal to 26.25 so remember we still have the same formula that 5.75 k plus the 5 minus k times 4.5 is equal to the 26.25 um we don't need a parenthesis here we're going to do the distributive property that's 5 times 4.5 and that gives me 22.5 then minus 4.5 k because a negative times a positive makes a negative 4.5 k i'm going to rewrite the rest we're going to combine like terms that means i'm going to do this one minus this one 5.75 minus 4.5 equals a 1.25 k plus 22.5 is equal to 26.25 we're gonna subtract the 22.5 from both sides 1.25 is equal to 26.5 minus 22.5 is and 3.75 forgot my letter sorry about that there's the k so now we divide by 1.25 k is equal to 3. that means that there has to be three pounds of the kentucky boob grass well that kind of makes sense right if we know that well if we do this one three then five minus three is two for the tall grass all right so then these mixture problems with percent we have olivia's trying to make her favorite lemonade the lemonade she buys at the store contains 20 lemon juice so we're gonna do lemonade and i'm going to call it the store bought one and what we have is um percent of juice percent juice from the start bar one is 20 but we don't write 20 remember we move it over one two point two is how we write that then total juice is what we're looking at for this one and right now we're gonna go in ounces number of ounces olivia wants to add pure lemon juice to the 20 blend to make 16 ounces of her own blend so we know we're gonna have ounces 16 ounces that's 16 of her mixture and so what's the other juice that contains 30 so remember we're moving it over twice so that would be 0.3 of lemon juice let j represent the number of lemon juice so we got lemon juice right here and j is the amount of lemon juice so we're gonna call it pure so it's pure lemon juice j represents the amount so we don't know how much there is and we're calling it j that well how much is 100 pure lemon juice it's a hundred percent so instead of writing 100 remember we move the decimal over and you get 1.00 so how much is the store-bought kind well we're going to take the 16 ounces total that we have 16 and we're going to subtract the lemon juice from it and that's what's left for the store book remember to put these together we got .2 times 16 minus j j times one which is one 1j we don't really need to write the one and then 16 times 0.3 i'm going to go ahead and leave the 2.2 of the juice is 16 minus j plus the 1j so i'm just going to call it j is equal to and then 16 times 0.3 is uh 4.8 i'm going to do the distributive property that's 0.2 0.2 times 16 is 3.2 and then 0.2 times same negative j is a negative 0.2 j plus j is equal to 4.8 now we're going to combine like terms that's this plus this or negative 2 or negative 0.2 plus one because it's point one one j that's three point two plus point eight j because it turned it out turned out to be positive 4.8 now we're going to subtract the 3.2 from both sides 0.8 j is equal to 1.6 divided by 0.8 that's equal to 2. then there's two ounces of pure lemon juice that's going to be added number five nathan is trying to trying to make a very sweet tea a sweet coffee drink for his dad how many grams of sugar so we're looking at the drink it's gonna have the coffee mix so iced coffee and it's gonna have sugar added to give you the mixture so since we're talking about grams we need the number of grams and percent of sugar and that's going to give us a total sugar okay so how many grams of sugar must be added so we're adding sugar and that's the g and how much of percent of sugar sugar is one hundred percent which remember we write as one because we're 100 percent we move the decimal over to write it as a decimal um must be added to 50 grams of iced coffee that is 30 sugar so don't forget to move the decimal over to obtain the mixture um that is 70. oops and i forgot to move that decimal over of sugar so we're gonna add these two together the 50 plus the g to get the mixture and now we have 50 times 0.3 g times 1 and then 50 plus g times 0.7 okay so we're going to do 15 times 0.3 is 15 15 plus 1g is just g and then on this other side we have 0.7 times 50. it's 35 and then point seven times g is point seven g i'm going to subtract the 35 from this side and i'm going to subtract the g from this side have 20 is equal to 0.3 g divided by 0.3 to both sides that's negative and that would be negative divided by negatives that's 60 6.7 grams of sugar now well it's 70 percent remember we wanted 70 of sugar so we're gonna have to add 66.7 grams of sugar to that iced coffee okay and our last one is uh how many grams of sugar must be added to 60 grams so we got a solution oh and on here i forgot to mention that this is the number of grams of sugar how many grams of sugar so again we have the number of grams of sugar so we got sugar number of grams and we don't know so we're calling it g and then percent of sugar and then total sugar how many what percent of sugar is sugar 100 so we just call it 1.00 and must be added to 60 grams so we got 60 grams of the solution that is 32 so 0.32 percent of sugar to obtain a solution of fifty percent sugar so we're going to add those two things together to get a mixture multiply these numbers together 1 times g is just g 60 times 60 times point 32 is 19.2 and then i'm going to leave this as g plus 60 times 0.5 so we add these two together g plus g plus 19.2 is equal to g plus 60 times 0.5 i'm going to distribute out that 0.5 g plus 19.2 is equal to 0.5 g plus 16 times 0.5 is 30. we're going to subtract that 0.5 g subtract that 0.5 g and subtract the 19.2 subtract the 19.2 this would be a 0.5 g is equal to 10.8 divided by 0.5 grams is equal to 21.6 so they need to add a total of 21.6 grams to the solution of sugar", "ioDFT-anXKs": "hi everyone and happy holidays today we are in the teaching kitchen to bring you some wonderful holiday treats i have a frosted sugar cookie protein shake that i'm going to demonstrate for you today you can use this for a pre or post workout option or if you're just looking for a little bit healthier of a dessert option this will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth simple ingredients so i'm going to start by actually pouring in a cup of vanilla almond milk you could certainly use soy milk or any other milk alternative that you prefer after you add in a cup of milk it calls for a quarter cup of rolled oats next i'm going to use a quarter teaspoon of imitation butter extract so believe it or not this can be found right in the baking aisle next to vanilla extract might be a little bit difficult to find so if you don't find it no problem you can actually use an additional quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract which we aren't adding in now so if you can't find the butter imitation extract just add additional vanilla extract a scoop of vanilla protein powder and then just a dash of salt right and then i'm gonna put this on my blender and then i'm gonna blend it up with two cups of ice in there as well here we go [Music] looks good i'm just gonna check it out blend it around with my spatula a little bit smells good okay all right just gonna blend it up a little bit more [Music] all right i think we got a nice consistency so i'm going to pour it into the glass here probably could add a little bit less ice to make it a little more liquidy you could also add a little more milk if you it a little creamier but that's all right almost there if you have a fancy mason jar to pour it in you can certainly do that put that there i'm gonna top it off now you could keep it as is but i'm gonna add a little whipped topping there we go because it's the holidays add a little bit of sprinkles and enjoy happy holidays my name is christina i am a bakery supervisor at holly point and today i'm going to be making for you my hot chocolate peppermint cookies first you're going to melt 10 ounces of dark chocolate dark or bittersweet chocolate in over a double boiler until it's nice and hot and melty and beautiful and then we're going to cream together a cup and a half of sugar and six and a half ounces of room temperature butter and mix that together until it's all nice and crumbly all right so we're going to mix it until it's all nice and crumbly and then we're going to add three room temperature eggs and you want to make sure that they're room temperature so that it doesn't have the chocolate seize up when we add the chocolate whisk that in really nice and combined then we're going to fold in our dry ingredients after you sift them so it's a one half a cup of flour all-purpose flour plus one tablespoon it's three tablespoons of cocoa powder unsweetened cocoa powder a quarter teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of baking powder [Music] lift it so there's no clumps you can whisk or fold that in you're going to add one tablespoon of vanilla extract then you're going to fold in your warm chocolate so the batter look like brownie batter then you are going to add six ounces of either semi-sweet or white chocolate chips when the batter gets nice and thick and delicious and you can scoop it onto a sheet pan these get baked at 325 for about 10 minutes make sure you give them enough room on the pan because they will spread out you can top them with peppermints for the holidays bake them for about 10 minutes i'll put them in the oven so when they're all done in the oven you're going to take them out they're going to be a little crumbly on top and enjoy them with a warm glass of milk thank you hello profs i hope you're all doing well today in the teaching kitchen i'm going to do a pecan caramel dark chocolate clusters i hope you enjoy you have recipes i doubled my recipe we have a lot of mouths to feed here at rowan so i hope you enjoy let me know what you think so first off i have a double boiler a double border boiling water in one pan pot a bowl or another pan on top i'm gonna put our dark chocolate in there now the little trick that i do i saran wrap it it will melt quicker okay you can use put another pot on top uh you just want to be careful you don't want to get moisture into the chocolate all right while that is going we're going to start melting our caramel so i have our calmer already portioned out i have my pan somewhat warm not very hot you got to be careful uh you want to heat the caramel up slowly it will burn very quickly you can also do the caramel in a double boiler if you would like now with your recipes that i gave you you do have a microwave version so if you care to follow the microwave version all right so why that is melted we're gonna show you a little trick with the pecans now we weren't able to get chopped pecans hopefully you did but if you don't have chopped pecans and they gave you got whole pecans no worries put it in a ziploc baggie a mouth or even a small omelette pan saute pan just going to beat them a little bit chop them up okay so we're going to set them aside check back with our caramel like i said keep a good eye on the caramel you don't want to burn it and we're going to slow it down a little bit so the other thing with the pecans you can do almonds you can do peanuts you can do a little mixture my wife personally loves it when i make a pecan pistachio caramel cluster all right so our caramel is almost there what we're going to do we're going to put up put our heat cans in our mixing bowl [Music] be very careful the caramel does get extremely hot you don't want nobody burning themselves all right and then we're just gonna pour it in there and as quickly as possible mix it in before it gets too hard make sure the nuts are all mixed through that looks good all right look at that that's perfect all right so a couple ways of doing this i like using a little ice cream scooper to make the balls or if you have two soup spoons you can mush them together to make a little uh cluster all right while it's still warm now i like putting on a plastic glove you want to make sure you can touch it without burning yourself we're in good shape definitely do it while it's still warm lay it out on parchment paper all right so i'm almost done portioning them all out and we're going to leave that one a little bit big it's going to be mine all right a couple quick suggestions while this is still warm start running hot water under put it in your dish machine as soon as possible you don't want the stuff to harden to the point where it's very hard to clean all right so i'm going to take this back put it in our freezer for a couple minutes so that they firm up and the chocolate will stick to them better all right our chocolate is nice and smooth our caramel clusters are firm and cold the reason we do that it being cold the chocolate will hold to it a lot quicker and better so i use a spoon and a fork here so i toss it around with a spoon now some people just drizzle chocolate on top of these it's totally up to you what you would like you can put a couple in there at a time toss it around kind of want to do this fast before your chocolate gets hard again you can always put it back on the double boiler or microwave it a little bit longer like i said it depends on how much chocolate you like you can drizzle it on um and i hope you enjoy them all right so we're gonna add a little festive holiday treat to some of these while the chocolate is still warm a little bit of holiday sprinkle cheer in there why not all right once again we're going to put these in the refrigerator now let them cool down if you have extra chocolate left you can put it in a small container put it in a refrigerator it will last forever bring it back out when you want to melt it down again all right our so our chocolate is nice and firm all you have to do is put it on a nice display plate all right and then the other thing for storage purposes i like putting them in a ziploc baggie keeping them in the refrigerator uh before consuming let them sit in room temperature for a little bit otherwise you might break some teeth i hope you enjoyed our teaching kitchen i hope you enjoy the pecan caramel clusters i made for you today thank you we hope you enjoyed our teaching kitchen for you today we hope you have a wonderful holiday season happy holidays", "LMqzkylkKjM": "may

small little chocolate boutique called pure shook a lot in space in Sacramento in the process of actually opening up storefront in downtown Sacramento where we're going to do some fun cream puffs and soft-serve ice cream and of course chocolates coffee and tea so and then some some cookies of course so really play around and have some fun and increase something unique and special so yeah I mean it's it's pretty much it woody so right now what do you have available so yeah right now so online what we're providing is a bunch of different pants factions let's see we have chrome assemble a cookie which is one of my wife's favorite absolute favorite cookies let's see we're out of our chocolate boxes we're waiting on on new boxes right now unfortunately for our bonbons but we still have quite a bit of ailable as well so a lot of fun stuff a lot of fun snacking stuff chocolate tablets yeah awesome alright so what are we making today what are you making what am I thinking okay so I'm making a fun cookie that my wife and I make often it's actually adapted from a recipe from a patient I'm a big fan of this page chef rich Bristol Rascal and it's it's a definite from one of his recipes and so we make it quite often to just snack at home it's it's basically like the Rich's chocolate chip cookie that you can possibly find but to play around with a little bit more is we add matcha nespresso to it so those are two things that we drink often especially the matcha and so it gives it a little fun unique playing playfulness to it but we also what we do is so one of the bonbons I make is a coffee in green cardamom so we start we started adding the caramel to it because I think it adds like almost like this Turkish coffee quality to the to the cookie so yeah it's just super fun and rich we use a cake flour for and so I have a low protein content so it's a little bit softer and cake care of cookie which is just it's kind of I don't know I think it's kind of a sinful cookie I'd like to have what's with a French press in the morning so yeah and then I'm sorry go ahead yeah I'm gonna be cookie so I made a brownie so essentially I mean I made your cookie all right remote I made your cookie which is really good I like the whole expresso and matcha powder in it I was told right delish I didn't have any fennel so I just added some money at the end but then I made so I I did do a recipe using cocoa berry berry ambassador um I I did one with the brownie that's in their book which I listed the recipe and then a chocolate chip cookie right then I did the same thing using your cookie and then a chocolate chip cookie right and they're both they're both delicious I love it so only this is that your laptop where you're working your laptop camera I just so we can see what you're working on right and same for the Instagram ones just so you can see you mix it you can get started all right can we see that yeah sure there we go okay so what we're doing we have the eggs in the sugar there and we're let this whip for quite a while basically the ribbon and basically what ribbon means is is basically where they'll start seeing the eggs get really pale and white and really hold structure so we want to incorporate a good amount of air but we don't want to whip it too fast because if you whip it too fast and you're gonna have large large air bubbles and those will just collapse a little bit faster when you when you start incorporating the other ingredients so remember all that sweeping can I get started on my brownie yeah please all right cool so I melted some chocolate right and essentially they asked in book that you soften your butter so you have a nice soft butter and you're gonna you melt your chocolate you have it in about 35 Celsius right and you're gonna add your melted chocolate to your softened butter right and you're just gonna mix that all together right until you have a nice little paste I found it interesting that they didn't want you to actually melt the butter so much you know with everything all together but you just kind of soften and then just pour over then we have our sugars and we have our egg and the idea is that you're going to mix your sugar and your brown sugar or Muscovado sugar along with egg mix that together until it dissolves so essentially we want this to dissolve once we've got that going on as you can see we're points you add that are milky chocolate so we have our milky chocolate and butter to know that in there we're gonna mix it up then we're gonna add in our sifted flour and cocoa powder there you go that's who brown and that brawny was like super super quick her liked about this brownie it's not like super dense either right right it was really like light and fluffy so there's our brownie mix let's see that right I ate the brownie and ate your cookie and I was like I can't eat any more of Chris Hardy's yeah had a we was I believe a single origin chocolate that I had yeah we had caramel with white chocolate okay let's see get it like a layered Shawn do you one get a single origin Madagascar I don't know what else there's quite a bit then we had a box of candied orange peel tough cover candy doors B sounds pretty delicious so where you at on your cookie now looks sloppy I'm almost done whipping these eggs so at this point what we're gonna do is pull it off and then we're gonna start adding the chocolate chocolate with cocoa butter I wonder if anyone has any questions right now any questions [Music] is it ready yet yes yep just about pulling so with the with the eggs they're pale they're starting to hold structure right we're gonna take this whisk off and we're gonna actually just pulled in this chocolate and then we'll transfer to a paddle and we'll slowly just just incorporate the only agrees with the paddle very lightly okay with the chocolate I try to go a little bit at a time what's the worry if you put in too much at once what are you worried about well I find it incorporates a lot easier when you just add a little bit at a time I mean essentially like what I do with a mousse same thing you know it's it's just a little bit at a time just to gradually incorporate other ingredients into the base luckily for this the yolks are nice and at room temperature so it's not gonna set up the chocolate yeah but also I sign like when you add too much of the chocolate all at once it deflates the the eggs a little bit more okay and what made you expresso and matcha why not one versus the other double caffeine Vincent double caffeine are you mad yeah but I'm a big macho drinker my wife and I drink matcha every day usually around noon but we drink coffee else in the morning so let's see the matcha we just love that extra little bit of bitterness that it gives you know it's not obviously like not as intense as like if you're gonna eat up a ground of ground espresso you know so it's a little bit more enjoyable but we also love you know just espresso and chocolate it's just so incredible together so just just trying to balance it out a little bit more you know yeah all right so for the drys what we do same thing just just mix it all together there's their sifted we mix it together and what kind of what grade mas are using or what brand are you using okay so I have this company that I believe they're based in San Francisco called breakaway matcha and they're just awesome they have super hyper premium watches that are that'll you know they're they're crazy expensive but they're absolutely just phenomenal but they also have a culinary matcha that that is it's affordable and but it's just it's incredible and it's hard to beat the quality of their marshes I love having these bowls by the way everyone should have these bowls at home yeah they're pretty useful and so then you just you put this back on with the title to mix it all together yeah just just till it comes incorporates together yep and then we'll add the chocolate and the fennel which I just diced as well so fennel we go super full small dice and basically as the cookies cooking it cook the fennel so it gets nice and soft and tender in the during the bake that's really cool what made you think about using fennel in and cookie so okay so fennel back in the day when I was a down in LA when I was the executive chef for David Myers group I used a lot of a lot of savory elements into my desserts and fennel was one of those ones that we use often you know it grew grew wild pretty much like in Malibu area and the Malibu Hills so being able to forage for it and find it was awesome you know so fennel pollen fennel wild fennel and so you know having like endless supply you try to figure out hot ways to utilize it so we used to make these actually into tiny little mini mini or D cookies and and we used to put the fennel in there so one it was way of utilizing product to it so it's you know espresso and and and licorice flavors go super well together so yeah that's pretty much it ya know it's pretty reason so I got a fennel mix it in we got some some more of our 64 percent quiet keel chips extent in super lightly and then we can start shaping nice so what I mean you're gonna you're gonna scoop it or gonna roll out into lon so what are you doing with that you know what I just for these we'll just roll them out by hand if you're like in a fine-dining setting yeah you can roll into logs and cut it or you could I do still like to keep or I still like to scale it at least but for the most part just roll it by hand okay yeah get your hands dirty you know yeah for sure alright well while you while you organize that I'm gonna quickly make a batch of chocolate-chip cookies cuz right part of my brookie right so we have our butter sugar and brown sugar right we're gonna get that into the bowl I let the butter out pretty much most of the day it's really nice and soft and I'm just gonna mix it up right but it's good point but you know your cookie it's easy to do by hand to me it's just always so we got our cookies just nice big round ball Vinson the juice scale yours at 50 grams yesterday or last night okay yeah GCD you see this time I mean it's smaller okay I like that you know we do cookie have a layer of chocolate and then layer alright so it was like the chocolate layered in so everybody you get a nice amount of chocolate I like that that was like that's like Joe Pesci in The Godfather I want equal amount of blueberries in every single pancake and so I can't my silver scoop and it really doesn't matter ain't the brownie cooks and the chocolate chip cookie cook at the same amount of time at the same temperature so we're going at 350 Fahrenheit and let's just say I take my brownie right forget my brownies on do a couple of those right and then I'm gonna have to use the same scoop but Ivan it out just a little bit too and then the cookie gets on top what I had done was actually used some dough the brownie does I made so and us down put your cookie and press down on top of that so that's what you bet right so 350 20 minutes it comes out of the event and it's just like I mean it's super easy I used cookie dipper you know and they're both really good yeah exactly what I did your cookie", "xmkz_LfUPYg": "YouTube what up what up what up we have the new inspired who send a sage cured resin 0.5 grams strain is Lucinda

back over at BK today to check out the latest version of a popular sweet treat they've got on the menu and given the time of year that\nit is it sure is perfectly named and how could it not be when it's called the\nOreo cookie peppermint shake I mean it is December afterall guys feast your\neyes on the latest sweet treat over here at BK this is basically their signature\nvanilla soft serve along with crushed Oreo pieces combined with that\npeppermint syrup that's blended up very nicely it's looking very cold very\nfrosty and then it's finished off on top with a very generous portion of whipped\ntopping very very nice very decadent and I got to say it looks very inviting on a\nsemi crispy day here in Southern Cali and I don't know if that color is\nshining through just a little bit here on camera but it's definitely got a\npinkish tint to it and I'm really diggin the overall appearance really fits the\nholiday theme pretty nicely let's see if the flavor delivers on this one though\nthis is the all-new Oreo cookie peppermint shake here at BK let's peep\nout this flavor yesir this looks blended very nicely with lots of whipped\ntopping let's dive in it's the Oreo cookie peppermint shake and truth be\ntold I'm not a super fan of peppermint so I'm really hoping the Oreo really\nstands out on this one here we go mmm mmm and it does that is very nice\nnice hints of peppermint it's not super overpowering which I\nreally like it's more of like an accent to the actual Oreo cookie and I got to\nsay that vanilla soft serve is pretty awesome mmm-mmm very rich nowhere near as sweet as I was\nthinking was gonna be considering I think this is like over a 110 113 grams of sugar it definitely tastes like it's sweet but\nnot that sweet but I am really digging the overall richness of this one this is\nreally nice mmm wow very nice I really hope that light pinkish color is coming\nthrough on the film for you guys cuz I got to say it looks really really nice\nand it absolutely is a standout compared to the regular Oreo cookie shake they\nhave here it's nowhere near as rich looking as the ad shows it to be like\nit's a much deeper red but it's really very nicely done it's just a tint though\nand you know I also really like how it mixes very nicely with that whipped\ntopping almost making the very top of this kind of reddish as well which I\nreally really like it's not so much the consistency of whipped cream as it is\nCool Whip it actually is giving me a vibe like this is Cool Whip but I like\nit guys and the sweetness is on point mmm very good so yeah really not too\nmuch else to say about this one it's exactly as they're advertising it to be\nwith just the right amount of peppermint flavor on the back end and more of the\ndominant Oreo in the forefront I mean that is the first name in the title and\nI'm really glad that the Oreo cookie is standing out but nicely done on this one\nso yeah I would definitely rock this one again and even though the original Oreo\nis still gonna be my favorite by far this version of it for the holidays is\npretty nicely done guys the peppermint like I said is right on point it's just\na little back end flavor to it and if you're a fan of the original Oreo to\nbegin with easy recommendation pretty tasty so as for the overall score I'm\ngonna have to give the Oreo cookie peppermint shake here at BK a very solid\n9 out of 10 it pretty much hits the mark on exactly what they're selling on\nthis one guy is not too sweet not too over-the-top but just the right amount\nof peppermint to really seal the deal and give you the feeling that it really\nis a holiday drink so I would recommend it to ya very nice but the real\nquestion here is do you agree drop those comments down below are you a fan of the\nOreo cookie shake here at BK to begin with and if you are how excited are you\nto give this variant a shot for the holidays drop those comments down below\nand definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another\nepisode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here\non my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in

trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania what is everybody up to how's it going i'm doing good i hope you're doing well what do we got today well if you're a subscriber and you watch all the videos you know that two one or two reviews ago i was talking about something that i was looking for that i couldn't get my hands on one of you guys suggested it and i found it i had to drive like an hour away and get it but i found it wouldn't you know [Music] it was you know it was there so today after searching far and wide we got ourselves a little bit of grass roots we got that grassroots what do we got we got that garlic cookies sauce so drew oh gee sub my man pots and pans drew said that this stuff tastes crazy and that it's in his top five and that i had to get my hands on it and try it because the flavor is wild to say the least so [Music] the last one i had pretty good pretty good motor breath the live sugar and sauce or whatever it was that stuff was pretty gassy honestly i had the terps came it brought the fire with the terps it was definitely gassy it was definitely it was good you know it was real it was real good so we got the garlic cookies sauce now this stuff is strange it's a sauce it is super low in thc and super high in terps like in insanely high in terps let's take a look yup just what i thought man this monitor why won't you oh god i can oh my god i can smell it from over here so like half of this is clear like it's invisible and then there's like a yellow sauce at the bottom and i think that's more like a sugar that's sitting on the bottom of some sauce and it's running you see that oh it's running like a mug i'm gonna do it the other way you ready one two three go this is as much as i'm gonna be able to show you of it maybe i'll get a picture probably not oh it's running i'm gonna lose some if i do that for too long [Laughter] this smells like somebody is growing some of the craziest weed you ever smelled [Music] inside of a pizza shop that makes garlic bread and garlic knots 24 hours a day that's what this smells like it smells like bomb weed and straight funky garlic man it i am the smell that smell all right this is exciting stuff let's get into the week week thc percent so we have thc a coming in at 52.266 percent cbga 5.267 percent thc 1.964 cbg 1.227 so just whole numbers alone 52 57 58 59 so it's like 62 percent i would say around 62 63 percent thc let's get into the terps though because we all know that's what we really want to know about i'm going to do the i'm going to calculate this on a calculator and we're going to see so we have beta mercine coming in at 5.74 percent 5.743 plus beta-carophylene 4.925 4.92 plus limonene or limonene whatever you want to say 4.549 4.549 percent yo those are all whole numbers over and over two humalien [Music] 1.61 one oh [ __ ] how do i go back i messed up all right all right see this is why i don't do this we got 5.743 plus 4.925 plus 0.5 plus 1.61 [Music] plus okay busy busy bolo 0.534 [Music] plus beta pining 0.406 plus pinin 0.179 plus trapinaline 0.057 that is 18.903 percent terps terps 18 or no almost 19 18.9 we're gonna just call it what it is 19 terps 19 that is 19 flavor this is crazy this is definitely like some [Music] some like just this is just terps basically like with a little bit of thc added in like you can't get it onto a thing it just runs off like wet boogers look at this i don't know if you guys can see that bloop it's crazy and it smells it stinks so good so i'm not expecting this to get me super baked obviously but i am a fan of flavor and if you watch the channel you know that so we basically bought this just for the flavor so let's see how it [Music] tastes [Music] uh it's so flavorful on the inhale it almost feels like you're inhaling like gas fumes [Music] and on the exhale it tastes like straight garlic just straight up garlic oh it's garlicky [Music] [Music] oh man the flavor it's like it's like it's like you took some of that juice inside of a jar of minced garlic and ground up a gram of some really good weed and put the garlic juice in the weed inside of a jar and just let those two things just sit together for a really long time and then [Music] drain out the juice and separate you know filter out the weed and then just put that on anything that's what this tastes like holy crap i'm pretty stoned too i'm not gonna lie terps definitely do their own thing i don't think i've ever had almost 20 terps in anything but terps do their own thing they make you feel different ways so this is definitely got a very unique type of feeling to it but man does it taste like garlic oh man and it just keeps hitting because it's sauce so it's all wet it's just chilling in there bubbling bubbling bubbling oh wow this stuff is pretty good it's a hybrid so here's the kicker right here's where you got to justify what you're buying because you gotta really like terps you gotta really like flavor because this is a 75 dollar gram and it's only like 60 percent so you're kind of not getting as much in way of potency but this is more of like a it's kind of got a niche market to it this is kind of more of a connoisseur thing if you're looking for some light effects but a whole heap load of just crazy flavors man 20 terps this stuff's crazy mary nothing natural about something having that much terps in it but like when you do this when you add this much terps to a thing it really overpowers with flavor like beta merse five 5.743 there's some concentrates that don't have 5.743 percent across the whole board this has that much in mercy beta-carophylene 4.925 that's a lot of karyophylene that is a lot of added you know added flavor added terps but i am not complaining at all limonene four point five nine percent when have you ever seen four point five nine percent limiting in anything that's crazy and it's still smoking like nuts i wanted to go in for a second hint but like it won't let me oh wow and it's got flavor still got the flavor it's got flavor to the end still tastes like garlic i'm telling you just the smell of this sitting here open on the table i guarantee you you can smell it through my whole house it's so funky it's got so much going on it smells like garlic through the whole the whole upstairs in my house just absolutely all garlic so let's talk about it [Music] 75 boxes it's a that's a high-end gram it's not a cheap gram that's for sure it's not the most expensive gram but it's also not you know it's not 65 it's not 55 75 bucks it's like upper middle so what are you getting this is about flavor that's what this is about i don't care what anybody else says you could say whatever you want something that has this much terps added to it and this much flavor like that that's a lot if that's a natural amount i'll i would be so surprised because it's got more terps in it than other things like a lot by a lot let's just say that so that being said it's phenomenal phenomenal price is a little sketch but whatever you know what grassroots is going for it right now they're going for that that top tiers like they're they're nipping at the heels of competitors right now they have some terpe flavorful stuff so like it's not really a big competition like i make it sound because we all win in the end the more the more awesome the products get on the market like the more the more us the patient benefits from the awesomeness that is coming out and honestly in the inside of the inside of like the industry i don't really think there's that much of a competition going on like i don't think people are competing like that maybe if you have like a cup or something if pennsylvania had a cannabis cup then maybe there'd be some competition like amongst labs and amongst brands but like as of right now there's nothing like that so it's not really a competition but like it is for to be the favorite of all of the patients so these guys are coming up i'm curious to see what other low thc high terp sauces they come out with like flavors because this one like man kind of changed kind of changed my my flavor palette like i've i've had garlic stuff before but like this tastes like you're eating garlic like just straight up and you get you get some you get some fire weed in there like it's there but like the garlic it just slaps the [ __ ] out of your taste buds and you smell it as soon as you open this up it's like funk garlic funky funk garlic oh it's so funky so i'm not gonna i'm done this gets a 10. the effects are kind of if you have a high tolerance you know this you know it this didn't really affect my tolerance it's like my tolerance through the roof it's stupid high and uh kind of embarrassing but with the market as good as it is i feel like that's how everybody is so it's not that bad i guess i feel like most of the people i talk to that are in the same like into the same things that i am like concentrates and that kind of thing we're all like at the same level of um tolerance and you know this might not get you super stoned got me a little gabby like it's making me a little a little talky it's making me a little a little bit of a talker but other than that like it's light on being stoney like i'm not it's not heavily affecting me but it's not why i got it i didn't get it to get super medicated like actually to tell you the truth i do have a lot of pain relief in my hand and it is raining today so this it could be from the terps it could be from the cb what does it have in it it's got cb something in it it's got a lot of cbga 5.267 percent and cbg 1.227 so that inflammatories in inside of cbs and cbd cbgs all that kind of stuff anti-inflammatories so and that's a lot 5.27 is like a ton and it wasn't the only one 1.227 cbg as well so like there's six and a half percent cb something you know cbg cbga so there's a lot of pain relief in there so if you don't want to get super stoned i guess but you want some pain relief and you really like the way garlic tastes and you really like the way fire weed tastes this might be for you 75 bucks super tasty not super stoney but that might be what you're looking for you might want to wake up in the morning do a dab before you leave the house to go to work and not be super stoned when you get to work this would be the stuff it's probably going to wear off on your 20-minute ride to work or 30-minute ride to work it's probably going to be on its way down because you know 60 it's not gonna be there forever it's very low so but pick it up give it a try if you've had it before let me know what you think tell me what you think what did you think of the grassroots garlic cookies sauce they had the diamonds or the sugar or something but that's not what had the twenty percent what had the twenty percent was the sauce so if you see the garlic cookies and you're looking to get this the same thing that i have it has to be the sauce can't be the sugar it can't be the diamonds it has to be live sauce that's what has almost 20 percent terps give it a try tastes crazy i'm probably gonna like save it and only hit it for special occasions when i really want to taste it you know because it's it's kind of special but yeah hey if you like the videos give them a thumbs up if you're not a subscriber subscribe and i will see you guys in the next one maybe it'll be interesting oh puffco peek will be here monday that's probably the next video i'll make so see you guys monday for the puffco peek box

we are continuing our passionfruit coconut series with this gorgeous passionfruit coconut conditioner bar compared to the other conditioner bar formulations i have shared this one has one really big difference which is that it uses entirely btms 25 instead of btms 50 or a combination i've had a lot of requests for formulations that use btms25 instead of btms50 it seems that btms25 is a lot easier to get a hold of in a lot of parts of the world so here's a formulation for those of you who have btms25 now this formulation grew out of the same sample formulation that inspired the cranberry orange conditioner bar i shared last year with the cranberry orange bar i did a bunch of work to take it from using btms 25 to using btms 50. so if you have btms50 i would recommend checking out that formulation instead this bar is comprised mostly of btms 25 with additional satirical alcohol in keeping with our theme you'll also find some passion fruit oil and some virgin coconut oil and for scent a passion fruit natural fragrance oil i've also included a few other ingredients that my hair loves like panthenol also known as vitamin b5 hydrolyzed oat protein and cetrimonium chloride if you're looking for substitutions for any of the ingredients in this formulation please make sure you're reading the blog post linked in the description box below i always include a list of substitutions at the end of the formulation and also make sure you look up the ingredients in the humble bee and me encyclopedia you'll find a lot more information there about each ingredient specifically including information on substitution suggestions i absolutely love this conditioner bar i've been riffing on different versions of it since last summer and i just love how it leaves my hair feeling i used it in the shower last night to wash my hair and it feels great and there's no other product in my hair this is just hair that's been washed with one of my shampoo bars and conditioned and here we are all right i think that is enough preamble let's go make a conditioner bar we'll begin by combining the four ingredients in our heated phase in a small beaker you'll need 30 grams btms25 and if you only have btms 50 please make sure you're reading the blog post i have a link to a slightly different formulation that uses btms 50 there 8.5 grams satirical alcohol 4.5 grams passion fruit oil and 2 grams virgin coconut oil up next i'm going to take a small beaker and put some water in it so this is distilled water later on we're going to need 2.25 grams of it so just make sure that there's you know a decent amount more than 2.25 grams in there our next step is heating everything through so to do this i like to do this in the oven since i find that the btms's can be a little frustrating to melt in a water bath so i'm putting both of these beakers on a just a plain old cookie sheet and i'm going to put this in my oven at 200 degrees fahrenheit until everything has melted through in the speaker and then the water will also be the same temperature while we wait for our heated phase ingredients to heat up we're going to weigh out the rest of the ingredients into a third small beaker you'll need half a gram of panthenol also known as vitamin b5 half a gram of cetramonium chloride 0.75 grams hydrolyzed oat protein and for substitutions please make sure you're reading the blog post half a gram optifine plus and half a gram fragrance of choice for this one i am using this passionfruit natural fragrance oil from essential wholesale this was gifted and we do have a discount code for it so make sure you're checking out the blog for that so that's all the ingredients weighed out now our next steps are going to be quite prompt so up next we're going to prepare our working area to make sure that we are ready so here's our prepared workspace i have the beaker with those last five ingredients here on a small scale we're going to be weighing a tiny amount of that hot water in here so that's what that's doing there we have a dish towel here because we're going to be putting two hot beakers down on this we have our mold over here i've also prepared space in my freezer for this mold so i can put it down nice and flat and i have two micas here firecracker and lemon sherbet sparkle both from yellowbee these are both gifted to decorate the top of the bar and i've got this fun little lab tool with a tiny little spoon on one end for scooping out the micas and scattering them over top and then it's got a stabby sabby end which i'm going to use like a toothpick to try and do some fun swirls on the bar before we pop it in the freezer okay here we have our two hot phases remember that these beakers are really hot so don't touch them with your bare hands the first thing i'm going to do is warm up the spatula that we'll be using to stir everything just kind of by getting it in here in the hot water i don't want to stick it in here because it's cool and then this will harden around it so we're just going to kind of warm this up in here so we can stir without creating too many solid bits of pop a hot mitt on i really like these ones because they have you know multiple fingers i got them at lee valley but i think they've been discontinued but they are trudeau brand but i'm sure you can find plenty of similar products all right so we're firing up the scale over here and now we're going to add 2.25 grams of this nice hot water give that a stir and then pouring it into this mixture and then give that a stir and then we're going to pour it into our mold and you can see that we are already getting some hardening there so this does happen pretty quickly and now we're going to do a little bit of decorating this part is totally optional but i think kind of fun [Music] and i think i will stop there and then i'm going to go put this in the freezer for at least half an hour to freeze solid once the bar has frozen through and become nice and solid you can remove it from the freezer you should be able to kind of pull the edges of your mold away from the bar and notice that it's quite firm just going to push this up kind of through the bottom here and there we are our lovely conditioner bar so you can absolutely you know take a small paring knife or something to these edges to uh to shave them down a bit you're going to want to leave this to age and dry out for at least two days before using but that is pretty much it so thank you so much for joining me well we made a gorgeous passion fruit coconut conditioner bar today please make sure you are reading the blog post linked in the description box below it's got a lot more helpful information in there information about substitutions scaling shelf

issac from under novel doing another protein snack review back with the Chobani clip range these are the little flip tops yogurts they're amazing this one I'm excited about this is a vanilla cookie crunch so hopefully it tastes like cookies and cream alright let's get in stats here look at 129 calories really low awesome 13 point 6 grams of protein awesome again really high protein for that much calories are you looking at 3.1 grams of fat really low for that calories and you're looking at eleven point three carbon hydrates which is just fine point five grams of dietary fiber so nothing to really worry about almost ignore that sort of thing so alright let's get into this make sure you bring a spoon if you're going to take these with you because they don't come with them the other two bodies but they're like sort of little circle tops I guess they come with little plastic spoons but these ones don't so so yeah just like plain vanilla obviously you got your little slide thing there flip it up this actually almost looks exactly the same is yesterday's mix it looks like a little white chocolate sort of chocolate chips in there sort of and like a chocolate cookie crunch kind of thing going on so I don't my say that the filling is may be exactly the same just with a different base yogurt which is good because that feeling yesterday was awesome in the mint so give this a go definitely good I know it's a very very young I've been like it's a vanilla-bean kind of like base yogurt and basically like white chalk chips and little crunchy sort of Cui's in there so it's super YUM definitely my favorite so far I gotta eat this any day all day it's a really low calorie snack it's got high protein low fat you should be able to fit this into your diet really easy and the best thing about it it's sweet it tastes really good yeah we win we win - Bonnie's in general our amazing like yogurts button I really like the flip tops I personally get a little bit bored just eating plain yogurt and I love you know quitting on you know Apple like ever stuff into my yogurt and these little flip things make it quick and easy and convenient so rating for this one I really really like this one a lot more I think this is gonna be an 8 point 3 I think it tastes by far the best best flavor sort of combo with a little tip in there yeah I'm definitely gonna finish this off so that's it for today guys make sure you stay tuned we'll be doing one more tomorrow and then I think we're doing like a frozen yogurt frozen baby yeah something like that anyway stay tuned we're always doing these every day so if you like the video it really helps us out and yeah we'll see you tomorrow", "8XvV00euYFU": "[Music] hey friends welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Alyssa and today we are throwing things back to a series that I started last year that I kind of just stopped doing which I don't know why I stopped doing it but it was showing you how to use an ingredient three different ways so I think it was called yeah I called it my spotlight series and today we are doing another one of those videos and I am showing you how to use hemp seeds so if you don't know what hemp seeds are they are tiny little seeds that go inside of these little shells so there are the seeds of the hemp plant obviously and what you eat is the heart of that seed so you take the shell off well you don't but they take the shell off and they put those little hearts in bags and you can buy them they're great for plant-based eaters because they are super high in protein they have omega-3 fatty acids and they are just a really great supplement to add into your diet so in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to use hemp seeds three different ways we are going to be using them in a hemp milk so it's like a non-dairy milk that you can make at home it is so easy you don't have to strain it anything like that and we are making a vanilla version and then I'm also going to show you how to make a balsamic and fig salad that uses hemp seeds for added protein and a little bit of texture and crunch and then we're finishing things off with my toasted coconut breakfast cookies I'm adding in some hemp seeds into these cookies because it adds a really nice boost of protein so how these are really great for baking just in general you can totally just throw them into cookies brownies cakes anything like that and it will add a little bit of extra protein which is awesome so all of these recipes are linked for you down below the milk is actually just written out in the description box so make sure to check out the description box as always if you haven't yet subscribed to our channel I would love for you to subscribe by hitting the red button that's right below this video and without further ado let's go ahead and dive in first up we've got the hemp milk so we're gonna start by just adding 1/2 cup of hemp seeds into our blender and then you can top that with some vanilla bean powder or paste I recommend using this and the extracts because it doesn't have that weird alcohol a flavor and then a pinch of sea salt and you're gonna top this with three to four cups of water from there just pop your lid on and pop your blender jar on the base of your blender and blend this up for about a minute until it's all smooth and creamy and then you can just pour this into a glass container I always like to use glass with my nut milks and make sure that you also have something that you can seal this will last in the fridge for maybe three days and you can use this as you would any other milk so in smoothies with cereal anything like that if you want to sweeten a little bit I recommend adding in a dash of maple syrup or a tiny bit of monk fruit extract but I actually like it as is our second recipe is the balsamic and fig salad so here are my beautiful fresh figs I seriously love fresh figs I can't even tell you they are so good so we are going to just slice our figs in half and then we will set those aside while we add everything else into our salad bowl so the base of the salad is going to be arugula I just love the bite that arugula has you could also use what other sort of green you like and then we're gonna top that with a cup of chickpeas some shelled pistachios our figs and a quarter cup of hemp seeds and for the dressing we are doing my creamy balsamic I actually showed you guys how to make this in the salad dressing video but I've just inserted this clip from that video anyway so you can see it again it's basically just balsamic vinegar tahini a little bit of mustard some maple syrup garlic powder salt pepper and lemon and you just stir it all together until it's smooth and creamy it is amazing literally one of my favorite dressings on the planet and then we will just drizzle that dressing over our salad and give it a good toss until everything is combined and I served this right away I would say that this doesn't keep very well in the fridge so I would eat it right away but it's just a really nice appetizer it also is just a really nice kind of late summery salad and it tastes so good and the figs are amazing last but not least our our toasted coconut breakfast cookies and we are gonna start with our coconut so add a half a cup of coconut into a dry skillet or on a toaster pan and just toast it for a few minutes until it's nice and golden brown and then set that aside while we make the rest of the cookies so the base is a banana so just peel your fresh banana pop it into that bowl and mash it up until it's nice and smooth of course the riper the banana the more sweet it's gonna be this was a very ripe one and it was delicious to that we'll add one flax egg quarter cup of maple syrup and half a cup of cashew butter I like using cashew butter in this recipe because it has a very like bland taste you could also use almond butter peanut butter or whatever you like I also could use tahini if you wanted and then just stir it all together until this is combined and smooth then we will add in our oats quinoa flakes baking powder and a dash of cinnamon and again stir this together until your cookie dough is combined and add in your add-in so our add-ins here or our mix ins are of course the toasted coconut as well as 2 to 3 tablespoons of hemp seeds and this isn't going to affect the texture or flavor at all I promise it just adds a nice boost of protein like I mentioned so again stir this together until it's combined and then we will place these cookies onto a parchment lined baking sheet sprinkle them with a dash more toasted coconut if you want them to look extra pretty and then pop them in a 350 degree oven for 13 to 14 minutes until they are nice and golden brown and somewhat firm to the touch then you'll just cool them on a pan for 5 to 10 minutes just let them kind of set a little bit and then we can transfer them to a wire rack and let them cool completely these will last on your countertop for at least three to five days you can also freeze them they are great for meal prep they taste awesome but they're great for dessert they're great with a drizzle of peanut butter or almond butter or cashew butter they're great dipped in milk you really can't go wrong with these cookies they are so yummy and they are super super healthy which I absolutely adore [Music] and there you have it my friends I hope you enjoyed today's video as always let me know what you think in the comments if you have any favorite hemp seed recipes that you make at home that you want to share with us definitely leave them down below I use hemp seeds really all the time I add them into my smoothies I use them in my pesto's I think that they're really versatile

are making a silk and camellia seed leave-in hair conditioner the name might be a bit of a clue but this gorgeous leave-in hair conditioner stars hydrolyzed silk and camellia seed oil camellia seed oil was one of the first oils that i really fell in love with when i got into diy it's a gorgeous ultra lightweight oil made from the seeds of the plant that gives us tea it has been used in japan for hair and skin care purposes for centuries and is absolutely gorgeous the conditioning part of this conditioner comes from three different ingredients there's some poly plutonium 7 which just has oh my gosh the most gorgeous feel that it leaves in the hair just there's some bantramonium chloride and there is some cationic bar gum as always if you're looking for substitutions please make sure you're reading the blog post linked in the description box below at the end of every single formulation i share there is like a list of substitution suggestions so you can make swaps for things that you have you know to swap out the things that you don't have so something that's really lovely about this conditioner is it is really nice and thick even though it is a leave-in product with quite a small oil phase so that's a combination of a few things we have a fatty thickener in there and the cationic guar gum also helps give some body to the conditioner so it can be really lightweight won't weigh your hair down and leave it greasy but it's also not really runny you can see that even though my hair really is not very tolerant of oils working that conditioner through there has not left it looking greasy or oily at all it's really just smoothed my hair out and made it look and feel and smell lovely well that's enough preamble make sure you are using the chapters links that i've put in the description box below so you can kind of click through different sections of the videos to see what it is you're interested in possibly you need a little bit of a replay of something here or there don't forget to read that blog post but uh come on let's get started we'll begin by combining the ingredients for two different heated phases and two separate beakers so this is our heated water phase and this is our heated oil phase for the heated water phase this is a 250 milliliter beaker and we already have 90 grams of distilled water in here to that i'm going to add half a gram of poly quaternium 7. this is really thick and viscous 1 gram vitamin b5 or panthenol and this is one gram of hydrolyzed silk now different hydrolyzed silks can have very different strength scent levels sometimes it's really really really stinky so make sure you smell yours first and if it smells absolutely putrid please either reduce the amount that you use or substitute it out read the blog for that mine doesn't really smell like much of anything so one percent or one gram works really nicely for me and for a heated oil phase we're going to start with the camellia seed oil so we need five grams of this and our cationic guar gum 0.3 grams it's going to give that a bit of a stir to break up any clumps to that we're going to add half a gram by hentramonium chloride and one gram sateril alcohol before we move on to heating things i'm going to weigh the water phase and note that weight so we can replace any water that's lost to evaporation during heating so to heat everything through i'm actually going to use the oven so this is a cookie sheet and i'm going to pop a third beaker on there and pop some distilled water in there so that's already just right and ready for us when we need it so i'm going to go put this in the oven at about 200 degrees fahrenheit to melt everything through because i find that the hentramonium chloride honestly just will not melt for me in a water bath this is the only way i can get it to liquefy and it's pretty easy so just put it in the oven about 200 degrees and keep an eye on it about 15 to 20 minutes should be more than enough once everything is heated through we need to move pretty darn quickly so i'm going to pop that back on my scale top it back up to that previous weight i'm going to stir this with my spatula first to warm the spatula up because if i stick cold spatula and melted oils the oils won't be melted anymore and in we go please remember that everything here is really hot it just came out of a 200 degrees fahrenheit oven don't burn yourself add a bit of a stir here get it all combined and then grab our immersion blender and start blending [Music] alright so that was about four minutes of lighting you can see this is still very liquidy so i'm going to shuffle it off the baking sheet now and this is now a reasonable temperature for handling so i don't need oven mitts anymore i'm going to leave this to cool for about five minutes and then come back and blend it somewhere all right it's been about five minutes gaining a touch of viscosity here but not a whole heck of a lot all right let's go that was about another two minutes of blending still pretty thin but thicker than it was leave this to continue cooling all right so it has been about 10 minutes and this is still warm but definitely cooling down and gaining some viscosity okay i'm just going to leave this to fully cool now i think i'll go take my dog for a walk and i will see you later all right so it's actually been probably about 20 hours came home after that dog walk yesterday and didn't want to keep filming so i popped some cling film on the beaker instead this has fully cooled and thickened and it looks absolutely lovely so now we can add our cool down face and we'll be done so here is our cool down phase i waited out without realizing the camera was on so in this little dish we have our preservative liquid germ plus at 0.3 grams and our fragrance or essential oil at half a gram i decided to use this birchwood ood fragrance oil from bramble berry for this batch i just really like the way this smells but you could really use any essential oil that you like or fragrance oil just make sure you are staying within maximum allowable usage rates and of course you can make it unscented by just using more water to combine i'm going to pop a bit of the hair conditioner in with our cool down phase ingredients give that a nice stir and transfer that back and stir to combine and now all that's left is packaging for packaging i'm going to use this blue plastic bottle with a pump top lid this is a bit long as you can see so just trim that with a pair of scissors and then we will fill it using a funnel that is just about a perfect fit pop our cap in beautiful in order to get the pump bottle working kind of unscrew the top here and find it usually helps to also pull up as you're twisting then to dispense prime up the pump here and there you go it comes out fairly readily but it's also not so rich that you know this alone will weigh down your hair even if your hair is relatively fine and not terribly tolerant of oils like mine is so you've got really gorgeous slip and you can just kind of broadly rake it through your hair once you've distributed it across your palms like this and there you go so we just made a really lovely silk and camellia leave-in hair conditioner thank you so much for watching please subscribe and please make sure you're reading that blog post linked in the description box below there's a ton more information down there including information about substitutions scaling shelf life and a whole lot more thank you so much and i'll see you next [Music] time [Music] [Music] you", "HuMWMOe1fyY": "hola familia it's alex thank you guys so much for tuning in today so as you guys can see from the title today i'm going to share with you guys some products that came over to me from style vanna i'm so excited to try these products because as you guys know i did try a little bit i dabbed a little bit into asian makeup and i've always wanted to try a little bit more so they did reach out to me to see if i wanted to try out their br uh a lot of products out of their website so i have a whole basket full of products here that i have been testing out for at least two weeks now i have my full thoughts on it my comparisons would i recommend it not recommended the whole entire boat if you're interested stay tuned but first if you're new to my channel welcome to the family my name is alejandra i'm an eye shadow enthusiast with the dashboard that is something that interests you subscribe jenna's and now without further ado let's get on with the products all right so before i get into the products and let you guys know my thoughts on them i did want to put down that stalvana did send these out to me i was not paid in any way shape or form they did give me a code so if you are interested in purchasing anything from the website you guys i'm dying to try asian skincare so that's what i'm going to aim for i will put the code on the screen for you guys that allows you to get 10 to 15 percent off of their entire website that does include exclude some of their weekend deals and like instant deals i think that's what they call them but the majority of the website is 10 to 15 percent off you guys can go ahead and use that and i do believe that i will have links for different continents so it's just not the u.s there will be some for europeans so if you are from europe and you want to give these a shot i'll also have those links down in the description box as well all right folks let's get into the products i am very excited about them some of them i will give you guys a heads up these products i did not specifically choose for myself the brand chosen for me or the company chosen for me the only thing i was able to choose was three i believe three different shades the eyeliner the brow shade and the foundation the foundation that i did choose was sold out so they chose that on my on their own and they sent me one that was like comparable to it so technically it was only two and you're gonna see how this panned out because i think that if a lot of these products were in the shades that i could have actually used i think i would have liked these a lot more just keep that in mind as i'm reviewing these products and i will reiterate that because i feel like if i would have had a little bit more free reign i think some of these products would have worked a lot better for me personally so let's start out with the foundation they had sent over to me the one night foundation it provides perfect natural coverage and skin calming effect with safety ingredients this was made in korea i can't read the back of it obviously so this is what the box looks like and this is what the actual foundation is i will have close-up of all of these swatches so you guys can actually see what i'm talking about when i am sharing these with you so as far as this foundation i absolutely love the fact that it is a a squeezy tube it is a beautiful finish foundation i love the finish i love how it wears i love how it looks on my skin i am wearing it today the one issue the one main issue you guys this is the color of a concealer for me it is so what you guys can kind of see how bad of a difference this is i even used my cream contour to kind of warm it up because if i didn't i would really really look ghostly that is the one drawback is the fact that a lot of these shades just didn't suit my skin tone and this is one of them this is way too light for my skin tone the good thing is is that i did mix it with my clinique foundation that is way too dark for me and the two mesh beautifully together the formula of this foundation is gorgeous i will tell you guys i love it i love the finish i love the way it wears it is a natural finish it's not heavy it is a liquidy foundation so it's not heavy on the skin and you can shear it out or build it up to at most a medium you won't get full coverage of this at most you'll get a medium finish with this one beautiful really really enjoyed this foundation again the only drawback is the fact that it's not my shade i don't even know if they have my shade because this is not the original foundation i chose so i don't know what their range is so i'll see on the website if they have one that is deeper i don't know their shade ranges honestly so i can't even say that they have a nice variety of range and there will be one for me because we all know that there's very limited ranges when it comes to asian makeup especially foundation so i don't know i don't know let's move on to the powder that was sent over this is the velvet power powder pack by hamish i think that's what the brand is called so this is what the packaging looks like this is a mattifying priming primer effect it's a setting powder this is what the actual product looks like you open it up you get a nice mirror in here which i do like get a powder puff which is decent so if you want to take this on the road or take it with you you can this is what it looks like right here it is a translucent very sheer white powder this again i could not wear it all over my face especially not with this foundation because i'm already pale enough as it is but i did appreciate this for under the eyes i do have this under my eyes today the only drawback is because it is a mattifying powder i have to be very careful how much i put under my eyes because then it'll look super dry and super creepy on the inner corners so i really have to be very light-handed with this powder i think that over the summer maybe it might work i don't know because i do get darker and this is very white so this again if maybe there they had different shades and not this white uh complexion i probably may have worked with that better but as far as right now i think the only uses that i'll have for this is the under eye and setting my eye primer that's basically it for this uh found powder for me other than that i think it's really good it's nice it's not cakey on the face again it's not something that's super heavy on the skin unfortunately because of the shade i feel like it just didn't work too great for me but if i had a different shade range i would have liked it a little bit more especially in the summer time because it is a mattifying powder and that would have worked great for me let's move on to brows so this is the brow uh pencil that they sent over to me this is a fork eyebrow tint i did choose this in dark brown so this is what this one looks like right here it's chubby it has the little four like a little fork right there you guys this if you have no brows and you are looking look you can see that right there if you are looking for some a formula that stays put here it is holy moly this does not go look it does not go anywhere if you really want a brow tint that really stays put on your eyebrows this is your go-to again dark brown i was expecting something dark this is way too warm toned for me can you see the difference i don't have it on my eyebrows today because it looks horrible on me the color is just way too warm it's too red so it really stands out on my face it just didn't look right i think that the formula itself is awesome again if you are that type of person that needs to have something like this like a tint because you don't have much brows i think it'll work great for me personally because i have full brows already this clung is that the word clung clinged i don't know clinged to my brow hairs so when i would put it in it just tinted my actual brow hair this shade so i i look like i have red brows basically and look at the difference like i like more of an ashy cooler tone eye line or eyebrow pencil this is the one that i'm currently wearing i'm going to swatch it next to that one so you guys can understand the difference between both this one is dark brown and this is also an asian makeup brand so see the difference this is the one that's in my brows now and this one's the one that they sent me and this is dark brown for them this is way too light and red for me so that's why i couldn't wear this one i think this is great though the formula is amazing you guys even wetting my finger like i just licked my finger and it's still there still there you guys if you need something like this 100 recommend this one as long as you can find your shade i don't know the shade ranges if this is dark brown i don't know what they have this is awesome though awesome if you do not have much brows to work with this would be a really really good product so this is the blush they sent me you guys and my youngest fell head over heels for it look at this adorableness this is the uh the tum the some some those little those little things you see on the disney channel where they have like little cartoons of the disney characters but they're like the little baby little stuffed animals they sell them at target i forget what they're called and i don't have it here are you here it's the etude lovely cookie blusher this isn't the peach vanilla cream isn't this adorable you guys so you open it up and you get this little powder puff in here isn't that adorable this is just cutest thing ever i wish that this was in a darker shade so this is the shade that they sent me it's a matte blah blush this does not show up on me at all look it looks like a powder to me to be honest with you this could probably be a face powder for me this does not show up look at that swatch it doesn't show up at all on my skin all it does is give me this ashy cheek because it's so light there is nothing that comes up on me so unfortunately i really couldn't use this one i've used it twice i tried to build it up and all it did was give me like a it looked like i had a dry patch on my cheek because it is a matte blush so it just looked like i was putting a matte powder on my cheeks unfortunately but i think that the packaging the presentation this is all beautiful if this was if this came in a darker shade they sent it to me in a darker shade i think i would really enjoy this one so again like i mentioned in the beginning this is like a trend with this one unfortunately the colors just didn't suit me but the formulas were so good this breaks my heart that it didn't work for me honestly because this is beautiful and i would have loved this if this was a deeper blush a peachy blush would have been awesome move on to the eyeliner this is the this is in deep black this is a color that i did choose the waterproof pen eyeliner by moly i think it's like mcqueen molly i think that's the brand mcqueen yes mcqueen new york and this is how the packaging is and this is what it is it's a felt tip pencil you have to shake it up and you guys i love this one absolutely love this one this does not bleed in to any of my like it doesn't bleed out it stays put i have it on today it's gorgeous i love this one really enjoy it and i'm not a pe like a girl like this but i do like it for these days where i just want to have a little bit of an eyeliner on and i don't want to have too much this is great i put this on and look it's definitely waterproof waterproof i just licked my finger look at that waterproof this is awesome you guys if you're looking for another eyeliner and you want to replace the kvd one this is a good one to have i really really like this one this one i think will come in handy for me when i am sweating when i am outside in the rain i think this will be good this product right here worked in every way possible uh that i wanted it to so i'm happy to have this one and it worked amazing amazing that's gonna take me a while to take off two more products you guys this is the next thing that they sent over to me this is the mcqueen new york molly what is this shade in uh this is an eyeshadow palette in tone on tone shadow palette so this is the packaging of it you guys this is the baby version of a mac palette isn't this adorable i couldn't help myself like look at this cuteness so this is what this palette looks like right here i can appreciate this palette one because of its size is just adorable i cannot help it two the quality is actually not bad it is what i'm wearing on my eyes you guys can see it really packs a punch i appreciate that the fact that i have neutrals but i have some brighter shades at the bottom so i have been using this one and i really enjoy it the only drawback well there's two drawbacks to this palette one is the size of the pans you have to you know really concentrate on where it is that you're putting your brush because if you have a big brush it's not gonna really work in here and two the shimmers in here are not the best the mattes perform amazing there is powder kick up as you guys can see but the mattes is what is the winner in here you're getting one two three shimmers and the rest are all mattes so for me this is a total win i really like this one i think it's adorable doesn't this remind you of the mac little mini ones oh my gosh just the mini version of it so cute really like this the formula is really good for the mats they're creamy they're smooth you do get powder kick up but they're very pigmented and they do last all day so yes this is definitely a winner in my book i really like this one and it's not going to take up a lot of space i can also take this with me my purse if i if you are working and you need to touch up this does not take that much space and you can actually multitask these you could probably use some of these as brows like this one right here contour maybe you know i mean like a powder up here so you can kind of you multitask this because it is neutral but you still get those bright shades last but not least is this product this is the lip product that they sent me this is a oh i can't even say but it's a wine lip tint in velvet the color hey guys so somehow my last footage of this uh review somehow got corrupt and i can't fix it so i just wanted to really quickly get on here this is editing alex my apologies for the way that i'm looking but i have no choice because i need to get this video up so i wanted to let you guys know about this product right here which was the wine lip tint this is great especially if we are mask square still this leaves a really nice tint super thin on the lips it's beautiful on the lips i wish i would have gotten a different color but it is nice it wears really nicely and it is a tint so once it wears off you get this like lollipop not lollipop like popsicle stick kind of look on your lips but because it is red it's a little bit more vibrant and noticeable and i whenever i swatch this on my hand literally the swatch stays on all day no matter how many times i wash my hands it stays on for a very very long time so this is great now that we're currently wearing masks i think i would really like this i wish i would have gotten it in other colors and if they do have other colors i would highly recommend this one as well that's it you guys thank you guys so much for watching thank you style vonna for sending these products over and my apologies for having to end the video like this but i have no choice and i just didn't want to end the video abruptly i'll put my videos on the screen for your enjoyment until then adios", "qCDGCL2-8ow": "Hello Welcome to Too Nice To Bite. Today I\u2019ll be showing you how to make these Rilakkuma cookies. It looks like the Rilakkuma is printed on the cookies. To start off these cookies, google some pictures that you like and print it out. I\u2019m using parchment paper to make the stencils, you can also use plastic folders. Cut out the outlines where you need to fill in the colours. Then get another parchment paper to cut out the outline where you need to draw the black outlines. Then go ahead and cut out all the stencils for the rest of the pictures. To make the sugar cookies, first dissolves the sugar in hot water. Allow it to cool completely. In a mixing bowl, add flour, baking powder, salt and a cold butter just got out from the fridge. Use a scraper to cut the butter into smaller pieces and mix with the dry ingredients. Then break up the butter by hands until everything becomes tiny pieces like this. Then add the cool sugar syrup into the flour mixture and mix them together. It\u2019s very sticky at first but when you keep kneading it, it will become a cookie dough. Freeze the cookie dough for 30 mins or as long as overnight. To make the painting paste, get 10 grams cookie dough from the dough you just made and cut into small pieces. Mix 3mls of water with the cookie dough. Keep stirring until it becomes runny. Then colour your painting paste. Then roll out the cookie dough. Put the stencil that is for filling in colours on the dough and fill in all the colours. When you are done, change to another stencil and draw the black outlines. Repeat this for all of you cookies. Finally bake your cookies at 170\u00b0C for 12 minutes. Thanks for watching and  subscribe to Too Nice To Bite for more cakes and cookies.", "UVmRPNtifPU": "what of you two you know what time it is pretty late at night can't sleep I'll dig this masked man

and put the bowl on top. I use Calibaut 57% dark chocolate. Put the butter in the bowl. Melt it while stirring with a spatula. You can make cookies with a more chewy texture by melting chocolate and adding it than using cocoa powder . Melt it to this level of concentration. It is good to set the temperature to around 40 degrees. When removing the ball, be sure to wipe the water off the ball. Water can get into the dough. Put the room temperature eggs in a new bowl. Add brown sugar. Whisk at high speed for 3 minutes. Brown sugar has more particles than white sugar, so it feels good to chew. The more air bubbles you make, the more you can bake cookies that don't spread too much . Mix the butter and chocolate melted at 40 degrees with the egg. If the chocolate is cold, it can harden when it meets the egg. Mix quickly, especially if the dark chocolate and the yolk's lecithin ingredients make it easier to harden. The more you mix it, the harder it feels. It is because of the yolk lecithin and dark chocolate. Mix thoroughly, but carefully, not too much. Please sift. Cheek the force and gravity at the same time. And also add baking powder. When I make cookies, I use gravity flour and soft flour together. It can make a chewy and crispy texture at the same time. Once again, mix with a spatula until no powder is visible. Add salt. If you sift the salt together, it will be filtered out, so it is better to add it later. Put it in the freezer for 10 minutes. I prepared a 4.5cm ice cream scoop. You have to use a scoop to bake cookies regularly. The reason I put the dough in the freezer for a while is to prevent it from spreading too much when baked. Put it on parchment paper or deflon sheet. Please drop the space. You can make a total of 8 cookies. Prepare American chunks. Compared to the covertture chocolate, it does n't melt even when put in the oven, so the shape is pretty and the taste is thick . If you upload too much, it will be very sweet. Please adjust. Remember to preheat the oven to 165 degrees. I baked it for 12 minutes at 165 degrees in a Gera oven. At first, it spreads ugly, and then gradually swells up and is baked as it gets rounder. If it's baked too thinly or spreads out, you didn't give us a tissue paper well, or you did a little while whipping eggs and sugar, so I'm happiest when I take cookies out of the oven. The cracks are beautifully made and the chunk chocolate is evenly located. Cool completely on a plate before moving. If you move it too quickly, the cookies will break. How did you like this video? I'm a person who loves chocolate cookies so much , I baked it with a lot of chocolate, and the sweeter and more delicious cookies were completed. Even those who don't have an oven should try it because it can be baked enough with an airfryer. I laid a sheet of parchment paper and stored it in a paper box. It is delicious if you eat it in the refrigerator for 5 days in the freezer in 2 weeks.

Thank you.", "B-txOCsDuug": "[Music] so we are in Broad Beach we just got here we're a little tired like 18 hours traveling to get here we are trying to find the gym we had to like force ourselves to go before we got like too tired where I'm following the girl which is never a good idea but no is we go this way so I have a shoe on Thursday I don't know if I can charge inhaled yet we will see but I'm very very workout is done how was your workout I did leg am a little bit a sprint doctor how's the driving going look at listing they drive on the opposite sides I wrote here and we had no idea I think it's been going okay though no I didn't know I got a PDF and when you go I eat on TV dinners oh this is really and I forgot flip flops and look what they gave me their sticky shoes [Music] [Music] here is a quick upper body circuit that you can do this is from my jumpstart Jun challenge so this is June 28th back in arms with the time under tension focus so what I want you to do is bring the dumbbells up hold for three whole seconds and then bring them back down in a controlled motion as with any bicep curl be sure that those elbows are staying tucked in at your side you're curling up to your shoulders and just really engage by holding that tension for three whole seconds and you're going to do 10 reps and choose between 10 to 15 pound dumbbells then the next move is shoulder press so you're going to push those dumbbells straight above your head really squeeze and engage your shoulder muscles hold that upper peak position for three whole seconds you really want to engage through your core here remember to exhale as you push up above your head and with these you can up the weight a bit so 12 to 17 pounds and for 12 reps next is one-arm dumbbell rows one of my favorites it is such a great back workout and a core and oblique workout if you are engaging your muscles properly so you're going to do 10 reps on each side so here's 10 reps on the left when you drop it down bring it back up hold this position for three seconds and you're going to be using about 20 to 25 pounds and don't forget to switch by now the last exercise in the circuit is a push up so what you're going to do is lower yourself hold this position for three seconds bring yourself back up if you cannot do a full pushup try to do incline and that is where you have your hands on like a bench and then your feet on the ground and that will lessen the resistance and make it a little bit easier if that is too difficult then you can do knee push-ups but I definitely want you to prioritize trying to focus on doing incline push-ups and then working your way up to full pushup okay so those are the four moves in the circuit we have bicep curl shoulder press one arm dumbbell row and pushup so you're going to do the stated number of reps and then you're going to repeat the entire circuit without any rest until you hit ten minutes of course if you need to take rest it's better to take a quick you know fifteen thirty second breather and then keep going and that will help you maintain form as well which is just as important as completing the circuit I hope you enjoyed the workout and as always comment below if you have any questions [Music] you [Music] how do you think you did look uh your your debut you did not do bad I don't know I don't even remember it what are you doing not used to wearing makeup there is another quick little burnout set that I have recorded and I want to include for you guys so this is from weeks 1314 of FBG two point one listing guide this is back in arms burn out set so first we're doing a three second plank with a push-up and then you're going to do that for five rounds and then we're going to do a downward dog push up so you go down to a push-up push yourself back into a downward dog and you're going to do that for five rounds as well and then you're going to repeat that set three total times and this is intended to be done at the end of an upper-body workout so go ahead and give it a shot and let me know what you think hair and makeup is all done so we are on our way to this shape body shop event I'm doing two classes today my outfit this is for class what very excited and here we go [Music] [Music] Hey [Music] Oh all done I'm so exhausted that was amazing it was so good I had so much fun meeting so many of you they were like how many like about a hundred I'm a bit over 100 maybe it was so great thank you to everyone who came and I'm looking forward to another one of these events very soon now we are going to Rome [Music] good morning guys so we are about to leave Sacramento don't have a poised still it's kind of coming back a little bit I want to show you my breakfast I'm having a banana and this is some it's like protein chocolate peanut butter I've never tried it it tastes peanut butter to me and we had eggs this is just a plate full of yolk Luca took them all out I had three eggs and then I'm gonna have this banana and he chocolate peanut butter and then we are on our way to San Francisco for me with some other things that we did get while we were here and traveling as we stocked up on like Greek yogurt and crispy parts and coaching along with us where we stay at in Cremona whenever we come home is at a place that has like a kitchenette so like you stock up all my crazy ogre and crew and weird even complete boat meal just gonna make it easier to have our own breakfast I actually have the same thing downstairs there's just so much better on a brush like make it made by you the way are we going proper to school for what are you excited always working so here are some of the snacks that I got for this plane ride I brought two bananas some cashews some chopped bell peppers from home and this complete cookie which is a protein cookie and I am going to go over this in more detail in just a bit here I'm just showing you a bit of the ingredients and the nutrition facts I'll give you a hint this isn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I did get it for the plane and then I also got these Greek yogurt so more on all of these in just a few moments [Music] [Music] so we got this at the airport I showed you guys it says creamy Greek yogurt so I picked it up and I was just eating it and has like wow this is really really sweet why so I look at the label you can see that first of all it's not Greek yogurt even though they advertise it as being Greek yogurt it is vanilla yogurt low-fat so just regular yogurt okay then look at the sugars 60 grams sugars that is why it's so sweet that is insane hmm this is not a health food back sorry guys and some other bad news I did eat this I kind of know that these are not that clean but they're so good and they have a lot of protein so it's like okay I'll have this on the plane and it really upset my stomach and I've had that happen before but I just didn't I was like okay whatever like maybe used to one time thing but so I'm no longer going to eat these I have talked about these a bit before that on the front it says 16 grams protein so if you look here servings for container - so for this 180 calories you have to times that by two to get the total calories for this cookie same thing with all this information here you get two times it all by two so protein what's interesting is that they advertised 16 grams on the front but they only show the nutrition information for half the cookie on the back and if you look here the carbs 27 grams you have to times that by 2 to get the total number of carbs for the cookie so the advertised on the front that it's 16 grams for the whole cookie but they won't advertise that's actually 54 grams carbs and this cookie 30 grams sugars so sorry guys don't work on Mondays either [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it just led me to the end I wonder why your soul almost ate so we are finally home and we have no a trip planned for a while so it really excited to buckle down and just kind of really you know get back into the swing of things traveling it's hard to stay on track and I would say that we did about 60/40 I would say completely 50/50 we really really try to put an effort in to make good decisions and not to get burgers everywhere we went and all the burgers are bad but you know in moderation I think one reason traveling is so hard because we're so used to being able to do what we do in our normal routine and it's like you know giving all of our effort and doing our best and when we travel that best looks a lot different than what our normal routine is and that kind of makes it hard to swallow that you can't do everything that you would like to do but really it just comes down just like I said doing your best that best was going was different from when you're on your routine to when you're traveling but at least you know doing something is better than nothing and I definitely didn't work out all the days that I wanted to you just have to listen to your body and that's totally okay and I think that it really helps you kind of get back on track for when you're home because you know that you didn't you know you don't have the guilt a totally going off track and you know that can sometimes cause you to defer getting back on track because you're like oh hi it's so far gone you know so I find that making that extra little effort when you are traveling really makes a big difference to help you get on track when you're back home however with that being said we definitely do need to get our eating back on track to kind of wrap things up so we are going to go do a cross your vlog that's not going to be in this video that will be in the next one so stay tuned for that and I hope you enjoyed it and found some good tips in between my travels about what to prepare what to pack and bring to stay on track so the grocery blog will be coming up next and I will see you guys next time bye when you lose fat you lose fat from your overall body including from your breasts first what are macros also referred to as flexible dieting", "SamJEVDfIns": "hey guys how are you welcome back to my channel today's video is an exciting one because i'm doing this valentine's day look with some products from style vanna and if you don't know what style banana is it's a website that contains a lot of beautiful things and beauty products and clothing from korean beauty you guys know that i've been loving korean beauty i've shown you products that i love from korean beauty in other videos but they emailed me and asked me if i wanted to participate in creating a valentine's day look with some products and they sent me a list of products to pick and choose so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put a demo of the products and i'm gonna tell you my thoughts about the products because i actually wore them throughout the day you will see me with different clothing when you see me filming the video and then i have to reapply one product and i'm gonna tell you the way that i prefer to use it because i reapplied it before filming the intro of the video so if you want to see my thoughts on this beauty haul or products that i received from a style vanna and a demo creating a valentine's day soft glam look then just keep on watching okay you guys so before we start i wanted to give you a code that they sent me and i'm gonna put it someplace on the screen but it's a code that when you make a purchase it will give you 10 to 15 of your purchase and that's something that i think it's nice for you guys i don't make any commission from it i just got a coupon for you guys so the code is inf10 jv the code was activated on january 30 so you're able to use it right now i'm gonna leave every product that i use below but check them out because the website comes with a lot of magic stuff and i have to say 90 of korean beauty products that i've tried whether their skincare or makeup i've loved i have a few opinions that you guys will see that are not the best of one product but the other ones i'm pretty impressed so let's just go into the demo while i talk to you guys about the products and give you the review okay so the first product you see me using here in this video is the pony effect seal foundation and this is a cushion foundation it's called the glow stay foundation it has spf 50 and pa plus plus plus it comes with 15 grams of product and it comes with a refill a backup of the cushion foundation i got mine in the shade vanilla and it matches me perfectly i'm really impressed with how korean beauty products and foundations match me so good i have tried different ones from other brands like misha and purito and also recently i tried the miss on one and those bb creams they match me like a dream the shapes that i pick even though they don't have that many shades the shade that i pick they always match me this one is truly glowy but it can be mattified with powder and it doesn't get oily super quickly that being said i love the packaging the fact that it's pink i adore the fact that it's refillable i love but i did my entire makeup using the little mirror that comes within the packaging and it comes with a little puff that i used the first time that i applied it so i think this was the reason why i didn't love my makeup or didn't love my foundation when i first applied it and i didn't get the amount of coverage that i would with my beauty blender so what i did was i reapplied it with my beauty blender and it's the finish that you see right now and even i went to the beach last week one week ago exactly so my nose was peeling off and it's still dry but when i apply it with the beauty blender since it's wet and the way grabs product is different it applies it more flawlessly and it looks way more full coverage this is supposed to be a medium coverage foundation a weightless formula which i agree it doesn't feel like anything on the skin and it has also a sheer glow effect and i also have to agree with that it's a beautiful beautiful product this is a 55 foundation but it comes with a refill so you get two foundations but right now it's on sale for 33 dollars and you can get and use the coupon on top of that so that's a pretty good deal when it comes to a beautiful foundation i have to wear it more but i will update you guys first impressions was not good when using this little sponge that it comes with it but i adore it with my beauty blender i use a damp of course the thing about korean beauty is that they come in few shades they don't come in that many shades because they target a different audience so that you have to keep in mind i don't think it's because they're not inclusive per se i think it's more that they cater to a type of customer that's asian and that has asian skin and they are light they have light skin and they have a yellow tone to their skin it's it's a different skin tone completely it suits me so if you have not been able to find a shade for you because sometimes even when we have a light skin we don't get to find the perfect shade i sometimes buy a foundation that it's the right amount of lightness but it doesn't have the best undertone for me and these foundations even the ones that are grayish they look beautiful this one is more on the yellow side and it suits me well and it blends beautifully this comes in three shades porcelain vanilla which is the one that i got and then tan which is sand beige in the shade zero four so only three shades is not that much but i truly think that you if you find your shade it's worth it when it comes to my first impressions now i have here the etude house this name some lovely cookie blusher and this is nine dollars and ten cents but it's right now at six dollars and 29 cents i have to say this was sort of disappointing even though i like the shade i build it like crazy and you can barely see it on my cheeks maybe this is more beautiful than what i usually do which is that i build my blush up that i want my blush to to be noticeable but this one it's too pale for me you can see it right here in the swatch it's basically like a powder for me for my eyes i think it would even work for my eyes the packaging is beautiful it comes with a beautiful puff but it's just something and it's a little kettle i think this is the kettle from the beauty and the beast but it's just it doesn't really work for me i know that i wouldn't pick this blush over the other blushes and i think that the concept is really nice but i would prefer a deeper shade the formula is powdery it's not my favorite and this is basically the only product that i wasn't in love with while doing this tutorial and using this makeup for the first time i think it can work for someone that's really really fair that likes a fair blush or a light hand blush or a blush that they can use without messing up having a fair skin tone because of me it doesn't really show up it shows up like nothing most of what you see here on my cheek is my bronzer that i applied before the blush i have to say i'm in love with this product i'm sorry that i didn't pick the other shade instead of this one but i'm in love and i know i will finish it up so i don't mind that it's not my shade you can see that this looks black and my hair is more on the brown side so in that sense it doesn't really work but this is the fork eyebrow tint and the brand is ri-ray and they had a brown shade and they had a gray black and i thought i thought that the gray black would be a dark dark brown and it would suit me better but it's truly a gray black so trust them when they say something this is a waterproof product and i was showing it to my mom she came here to visit and you can see that it creates sort of a microblading effect i loved it i loved how easy and quick it was to use on my brows i can't go on top of it with the gimme brow and maybe switch up the color but this is just lovely i just think it's so wonderful and once it sets you can see right here that i'm pressing my finger it doesn't move it doesn't budge so that means that you can do your brows make them fluffy in a way and then i even applied the brow freeze from anastasia on top of it and i was scared that it was gonna remove it and it stayed put the entire time and i've had my makeup since the beginning of the day i did my makeup about at 9 00 am and i only removed this part of the foundation and redid it because i wanted to live with a beauty blender so my brows haven't been touched again since 9am in the morning and it's already gonna be 5 p.m in the afternoon so that tells you a good deal about this product because some of these markers and things i know that they fade away and like i said you can use the coupon code and i will leave the links down below okay so they have four shades oh my goodness and i didn't choose okay so i think they gave me a choice of two shades i chose the gray black and the gray black is 4.89 the dark brown is eight dollars so it has a range but it's supposed to be 15.23 but it has a discount so the most expensive one is dark brown at eight dollars and nine cents and then the cheapest one is the gray black at four dollars and 89 cents i think you're gonna love this product these came pretty quickly after they sent me the tracking number and i just think it's a wonderful wonderful color they look so beautiful and i can see here the swatches and stuff some of them are really light so you have to look at the swatches and choose your shade right because if not you're gonna mess it up all the instructions here on the website for this product are in korean so i can't tell you anything else about the product but i know that it's waterproof i know that it stay put i know that it doesn't budge and i know that they have four shades but you have to be careful in the shade that you pick so that it can work for you but so far i'm in love and i would like to try more of these types of products for my brows so when i saw this i was excited because it's a mini but i wasn't excited because i thought oh that looks just like a cheap palette that you would get when you were little and maybe it will not have pigmentation this is the eyeshadow that i'm wearing on my eyes today and i have to say i'm impressed i'm not in love with the shimmery shades maybe they apply better with the finger but no they're they're really sheer they don't even you can't even notice that you have them you can use them to blend all over the lid and whatnot i use them both but i didn't find them to be super pigmented but then i did my eyelids with these three shades and use this to define my eyes and i love the consistency of the shadows i think this is a nice palette and to be honest my mom came earlier and she was asking if i could give it to her because it comes with beautiful colors and i told her mom when i travel i'm gonna take this with me and i know i will i love small palettes and this is one that has basically a lot of transition shades and it has everything that you will need except for a black but i will keep using this up and maybe put it in my rotation for next month and i will let you guys know how it works but it's just beautiful i'm gonna swatch a few of the shadows that i use for you guys and you can see how pigmented that is you can see that that's really pretty you can see it right here they feel like rich eyeshadows but they blend beautifully on the eyelids and a few a little of them tends to blend away when you're using a blending brush but most of the eyeshadow stays put and i've tried extremely high-end eyeshadows that blend away as you go and you have to reapply them and just tap them on the lid because they when you blend them they go and become nothing and this one really surprised me it blends beautifully it's super easy to use it can be sheer if you want just a wash of color it comes with 15 shadows and they all fit like a credit card in your hand so this for me i thought it was gonna be a fail and it was pretty nice this is the mcqueen new york ten zero one tone on tone shadow palette and this is again korean beauty as well okay so this palette is actually 38 dollars but right now on the website is 55 percent off and it's going for 17 and it has reviews and it has four and a half stars out of five and people are saying that it blends beautifully that it has every color that they would need for every day or even to go out at night it can be smoky and it can be a daytime palette for 38 dollars i would expect it to be bigger but one of the things that i love about it is that it's really tiny so yeah this surprised me i wasn't expecting this amount of pigment it really surprised me in a nice way and i have to say you guys know i love boring palettes that have a browns and transition shades i just i love them they they're right up my alley and i wasn't expecting it for it to perform the way it performs but it performs beautifully i love the brick smoky light eye that i created another product which is the winged liner that i'm wearing is the waterproof pen liner by mac queen and i have the shade black deep black and i love these this comes with a brush tip instead of a felt tip you can tell that it's wonderful the first time you use it it's also waterproof so i have it right here and when i was with my mom i was just rubbing it off after applying it and i was telling her how waterproof it was and i even bought one here at a store it's called miniso and oh my goodness that was so crappy i liked it because it was affordable i was looking for a pen but then after continuing to use it and i finished it of course because i need to finish my stuff it started to bleed always when i applied it it started to bleed this one my eyes were getting watery in the middle of the day i was on my bed and i was resting to the side while finishing editing a video on my phone and then i always get like a tear running down my eye and the liner didn't budge didn't budge at all so i would recommend it and this reminds me i haven't used the new formula but the kat von d pen that in trooper that i love that it came with a brush tip this feels exactly the same and this is right now on their website for 5.49 in every shade and they have three shades deep black the deep brown and brown black and also it says here that it's 13.50 but it's 5.49 so it has 16 reviews and you guys this one came as a backup because i already ordered it from another website so i'm so happy to have a backup of it and i'm so happy that i get to use it because i do winged liner almost every single day i just i just love this type of product and i know it's a staple i want products in my collection that i know i will finish and that i can play with every single day this is the cutest packaging and you guys know that i love to look like a little girl with my lips all reddish or pinky and i love a lip tint more than anything i have one that is more moisturizing but it turns my lips into more of a deep fuchsia shade but this one is red and it comes in this little wine bottle i'm in love it says chatu laviot laviot i don't know how to pronounce that but it says laboratories of nature wine lip tint velvet and the box even is like a box of wine i just think this is so adorable you will see me using it on the demo but last night when i got the box i'd applied it fully like it comes with a little wand like a concealer one a doe foot applicator and i applied it like a liquid lipstick and oh my goodness i looked crazy because i don't like a bright red lip but when you apply it as a tint it's more beautiful it looks more like the way i have it right now on my lips so you can see that this can be really deep but then if you blend it it turns lighter and it looks more like like if i blotted my lips and got the excess removed you can make it more full coverage or make a heavier tint out of it but it's just so beautiful it looks almost fuchsia here but you can see on my lips it looks more on the red side and it doesn't budge and it doesn't dry my lips out and i can apply a lip gloss if i want on top a clear lip gloss and it will give me look that i love for every day which is not to mess up with my lipstick that much to be able to reapply it easily i apply a little drop and then mix it with my finger or blend it with my finger and then it's also so easy to use and it has a cute packaging so this shade it's the shade number rd01 cognac red and oh my goodness they have marriage or marriage coral muscat orange malbec pink and saint rose so they have four other colors or five other colors on this formula and i have to say i want them all this is the type of product that i go through that i finished the reason why i started loving this product so much it was because of my givenchy le rouge perfecto i hate that my lips are pale and i want something that has no fuzz about it that will not make me look crazy when it's rubbing off and that it will give me the appearance of youthful lips without any hassle i'm so impressed by this formula and the fact that they have it in different shades i love even more so the price of this is usually 13 and 80 cents it now has a discount and the prices vary from shade to shade but most of them are 12.50 and then this one or and the other one it's 9.99 so 10 and it says here that if you buy three you will get one for free or something like that yeah so you can just go and check it out but i'm in love with this formula they have here i think a nude one that looks like a nude i think it's the rose the malbec pink and that i would love for every day as well this one is a cutie and this is a product from hamish you guys know that i purchased before the hamish cleansing balm which is one of my favorites i use that every single day to remove my makeup and i really love it and this is so beautiful it looks so pretty even though it's a plastic compact it looks more expensive and i love that it's white with gray or with a hint of silver on top of the gray and it comes with a little puff and i love that it comes with a mirror and this is a blotting powder so good for me that i have an oily t-zone so it says that you grab the powder you won't see this on the demo because i didn't use it you grab the powder and you can just put it on your face and it will be translucent and for sure that's the case you can see here that i apply it on top of what i have and it looks like nothing so this is a powder to remove excess oil from your face to hide your pores and just to freshen your makeup throughout the day this will be a powder that i will carry on my back because it won't be a powder that i can use on my beauty room it will be just a touch-up powder to make my skin look flawless after the oils have been peeking through throughout the day i will keep you guys updated with all of these products and all of the other products that i've been showing you guys that i got on pr or on my host that i've purchased this was good this was good because basically just one product was a fail so that was an

"MhU79dARh3E": "hi this is eco peace mom with a recipe for some healthy very easy cookies to make that can also be low sugar okay so in the middle you see the gluten free baking flour basic recipe is on the back and then i altered it a bit so just a second so there's the recipe it's scrumptious blueberry muffins and um then it's a second okay so on the bottom left those are pumpkin seeds those have been toasted and you can even add some spice to them like Cayenne a little bit of cayenne pepper chili pepper and salt and I would toast them with in with oil that won't that can withstand a higher temperature and right now i'm using sell our oil for that so next to that you see were when they were rye ground them and that make some pumpkin seed flower that you can use for baking and the really great thing about pumpkin seeds is they have zinc in them you can also get zinc in oysters and I believe shrimp some other seafoods so zinc is very helpful for the hair for the scalp it's in some shampoos anti-dandruff shampoos and my understanding is that is also great for the intestinal health that's just really important it's a one of those it also helps the immune system and yeah just that's great and most people are low in in zinc helps colds you can there's you know remedies of colds would help zinc and vitamin C okay so I also blended some oats so I did about half of the baking flour flour it calls for two cups and then the other the rest of it I made up with like oat flour and the pumpkin seed flour so then the I have these little tiny grapes but you can use blueberries cranberries and then the egg replacer you can use eggs or this the great thing about egg replacers if you have it around if you're out of eggs you've got something to cook with and then it helps glue things together kind of and has some tapioca flour in it also you can have eat that make the whole thing and just have it raw you don't have to even cook it if you don't have real eggs in there so um enjoy all right", "x1SEo05vk5Q": "hello hello cannabis connoisseurs welcome back to the channel Kimo here with a brand new purchase just back from the store with this new paper cartridge called a

here nothing too fancy or you know standard thing you th see warning label on here this little mouthpiece condom ah well alright yeah it's a nice-looking cartridge against as far as cartridges go let's just stick it on the old standard 510 thread battery any one of these bad boys will do for it of course and let's give it a go shall we see I mean yeah it's good mmm I don't know what a bit of a peppery earthy flavor to it definitely nice very smooth on the first draw here so first impression is very nice on this let me check another one out it's a very nice flavor profile going on with this thing I got to admit it's great it doesn't really see what the strain is on it just says sativa but this is really wonderful okay so I'm gonna put this thing through its paces here the next little while and yeah come back and let y'all know what I think of it overall okay so final thoughts on the collab project vape pen here I really like it I've been ripping this thing all day long gives you a

three dollars cheaper so value wise this is very easy to recommend effect wise is very easy to recommend flavor wise very easy to recommend it's good taste you got kind of a spicy peppery earthy taste can find a lot of information online about the collab project it's at Eve is 0.5 like I don't know what strain it is which is a little annoying but whatever it is it's really good I don't know if it's all natural cannabis terpene in here if there's a some kind of botanical terpenes added I know they do that with some vapes nowadays I'm not sure but try to find out a little information I tried to get some more from the review I couldn't find much but whatever it is it's really good it's really smooth it's not harsh it's got a good taste good amount of vapor production so overall this thing is really easy to recommend it's good value great taste great effects collab project sativa 0.5 good job guys it's a winner probably would purchase again what's it I want to hear what you say leave me a comment if you tried it I want to know what you think about it if you agree with me or not and yeah we'll see you again for another review thanks for watching keep smoking we'll talk to you soon", "hkFkGP5G4HU": "[Music] hi everyone this is cooking with kurt today my husband donald and i are going to show you how to make traditional hyderabadi chicken biryani i spent many of my childhood years in hyderabad india and this is one of my favorite dishes we'd have it on saturdays for lunch oh and it's become one of my favorites too i believe this dish is how you first introduced me to indian food so good this recipe was requested by rowena altea thank you so much rowena for your request we hope you like this video to start we're going to marinate the chicken take a small skillet and over medium heat add in two tablespoons of butter and let it melt when it has melted add in three bay leaves one cinnamon stick five pods of cardamom five cloves and 1 4 teaspoon of peppercorns or about 20 balls saute the spices in the butter until they become aromatic about one minute turn off the heat and set this aside then take a non-reactive bowl like glass or stainless steel add in about two to two and a half pounds of chicken pieces we prefer chicken thighs half a cup of yogurt four teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of red chili powder 3 teaspoons of yellow turmeric powder 1 small green chili minced and 3 teaspoons of meat masala or chicken masala powder you can get this kind of meat masala powder at most indian stores it's also called garam masala but make sure you get south indian garam masala the ingredients list should include cardamom cloves and fennel seeds we've listed the ingredients of this meat masala powder in the description section below to help you identify the right one in the store now add in the butter with sauteed spices to the meat and mix all of this together by hand till everything is well incorporated in sort of rubbing and massaging all the spices into the chicken pieces then cover with plastic wrap if you're preparing your biryani the same day let your meat marinate at room temperature for one hour but for the best flavor we recommend marinating it overnight in the fridge if you marinated it overnight take it out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature the next step is to prepare the rice mixture fill a big pot about 2 3 of the way up with water and turn on to medium heat the water will be in excess which we will strain out later add in 4 cups of basmati rice 2 teaspoons of salt 1 4 teaspoon of cinnamon powder 2 pods worth of crushed cardamom seeds 5 cloves and 1 small green chili that's been cut lengthwise gently mix it in the trick here is to let the rice only cook halfway right which will happen faster than you expect sometimes even before the rice reaches a clear boil so checking often like every two minutes take a grain of rice to check its texture you want it so that it's still a bit translucent a little bit softer than raw rice grains but still have a very firm al dente texture and still have a bit of crunch to it when the rice reaches this texture turn off the heat and strain out the rice onto sieves letting all the hot water drain out and let the rice rest in the sieves next take a large skillet turn onto medium-high heat and add in 1 cup of vegetable oil when the oil is hot enough that it's shimmering add in two large yellow onions that have been cut into long slices like this and fry the onions until they are caramelized when the onions are nicely browned turn off the heat and strain the onions out over a heat-proof container set the onions inside to cool while collecting the oil the onions were frying it two bunches of cilantro and set it aside do the same thing with two bunches of mint leaves except separate about three tablespoons of mint leaves from the rest of it the three tablespoons of minced mint will be for making the raita and the rest of the mint is for the biryani next either by hand or using a lemon squeezer squeeze the juice from one lemon into a small bowl then into a separate small non-reactive bowl squeeze the juice of two lemons into it in the second bowl with the juice from two lemons add in one teaspoon of saffron and one pinch of orange food coloring powder mix this a bit and set this aside now that we have all the different components of the biryani prepared we're ready to assemble the layers take a large pot with a heavy tight fitting lid today we're using our dutch oven or casserole dish as some people call it but any large pot will work as long as it can hold a minimum of five and a half to six quarts and has a solid lid with no vent holes on it place all the marinated chicken in an even layer so that it covers the bottom of the pot spread half of the fried onions on top of the chicken then sprinkle in two teaspoons of meat masala powder half of the minced cilantro half of the minced mint leaves the prepared juice from one lemon and half of the remaining oil from frying the onions next place all the half cooked rice on top as the next layer then like before spread the remaining half of the fried onions sprinkle in two teaspoons of meat masala powder the remaining half of the minced cilantro remaining half of the minced mint leaves and remaining half of oil the onions were fried in finally drizzle the lemon juice mixed with saffron and orange food coloring when you finish creating the layers of biryani place about three layers of paper towels over the rim of the pot and cover with a solid tight fitting lid you can also use an absorbent cloth instead of paper towels if you don't mind your cloth potentially getting stained orange and forever smelling like biryani either way the cloth or paper towels will absorb the excess moisture as the biryani cooks so that the meat doesn't get soupy at the bottom if you don't have a heavy lid you can also weigh it down using a heavy object like a mortar from your mortar and pestle inverted and placed on top now when your pot is all ready to cook turn on the flame to the highest heat possible and let it cook for 5 minutes then turn it down to medium heat and continue cooking for another 5 minutes then turn it down to the lowest heat possible and let it cook for 5 minutes more finally turn off the flame completely and let it finish cooking in its own steam for another 30 minutes when the flame is off and we're waiting for the biryani to finish cooking in its own steam we can work on making raita which is a condiment served with biryani take a mixing bowl add in three cups of yogurt one large cucumber diced one tomato diced the three tablespoons of minced mint leaves that were set aside earlier half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of ground cumin 1 4 teaspoon of paprika and 1 tablespoon of sugar mix this together till it's well combined and store it in the fridge till you're ready to serve it when the biryani has finished cooking uncover the lid and paper towels that smells so good using a long spoon take out one of the pieces of chicken to make sure it's fully cooked a thermometer should read a minimum of 165 degrees fahrenheit when inserted in the thickest part and there it is hyderabadi chicken biryani served with [Music] well that taste always brings me back to hyderabad and it's such a wonderful mixture of flavors from all

to do is traditionally it'd be used without an egg so that you could ship it off to all those lovely soldiers they were fighting for their country and it wouldn't perish it wouldn't spoil so here comes my own spin now I have a bit of hemp seed and hemp flour here and the reason is that it's a wonderful seed that this one's just been milled down where it's got a lot of complete protein meaning it's great frog body I mean we get quite full so we're not gonna have 25 of these cookies okay we're probably only okay with just one witch pushing crows fantastic so what I've got here is I love you to do one tablespoon of that hemp flour on you're gonna notice it's quite dark it's really kind of kept that green and it's so rich in soluble fiber what that means is it basically makes our bowels really really happy so a happy digestive system is a happy brain my bowels feeling great right now it's gonna feel even better just one tablespoon there now I have some coconut flour here as well so it would be a little bit too heavy if we did the whole thing with that it would also be quite dark and we do want things to look quite lovely don't we especially we're selling them at a fete which is a great thing to do with things like cookies so I've got some beautiful slivered almonds here as well okay you can change it to any nut that you like here I guess this enhances our what a kind of changing for oats so we'll just have some of those lovely hemp seeds there now the great thing about hemp seeds full of protein a little bit me the three as well I'll have I'll have that whole thing please a half a cup looks a bit when you use the other bag always leaving that everywhere I have some lovely desiccated coconut as well which is gonna taste make it very very tasty just in there now the easy thing we're baking if you're intimidated by baking and this is kind of baking is it it's a cookie you get your dry ingredients okay get a little bit of salt there as well because I do think for baking a little okay exactly and then we add all wet so I'll just make it a little well in there now I have some coconut oil and you've melted it because normally soloed like this and it makes me think about like Brylcreem exactly but this also the reason why I don't need to use so many eggs either so just gonna use Warren egg just to help bring things together as well and then I have a little bit of maple syrup now you can use brown rice syrup you can use whatever you want agave nectar whatever you have lying around even golden syrup but I really am trying to make this as healthy as post 'that was the quickest easiest cookie recipe on the planet it was never because you've used maple syrup that's the liquid if you didn't use maple syrup and you use sugar you might need to add another egg or maybe a little bit more coconut oil exactly just switching out a few ingredients makes it a little bit the nutritional profile a little bit more so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna roll them into little balls or you can use a spoon there as well they're like this and this will make about eight cookies okay which is a perfect amount to share with you mates well I'm thinking if you're gonna make really nice cookies or biscuits we call them here you know you're not gonna share them with anyone I just want to eat them all yourself there we go so what we're gonna do is just get those all nice like that and we're just gonna Pat them down with a spatula as well not and we're gonna put them in the oven on about 180 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes now you can see which one's I don't want to run Zeus done hey we got a few big easy few little ones Sophie there's even those out and then we'll do is put them down with a spatula and I've just got the oven preheated 160 and just gonna take about 10 to 15 minutes you're just watch until it goes a little bit golden on the sides doesn't need long get stuck in and get a little bit messy I actually really love that green color there that's it so what we'll do now is just put the oven [Music] how good was that 10 to 15 minutes got it beautiful like that now I did say this is it for it well if you got of cause you really believe in and you want to just make a little bit money looking a little bake sales a bit of a way to do it they weren't like the Yang's excuse to do so what I've got here is a little bit here and while I am packaging line up lovely I can have one I'm gonna just put a few here I've even got a little birthday a little Christmas gift can we never go empty-handed when we go around someone's house dewy that's not what we do on a minor cake or maybe a slipper over the shoulder exactly it's very interesting favor I mean I would have it a little bit sweeter but it's actually quite nice very nutty and very smooth I find is actually giving it a beautiful texture nobody put my finger there yes you can if you want there you go lovely no you can take that round lovely old lady you know what Rosie you've taken an old and Zac biscuit idea and put a really nice spin on it's really clever and I like what you've done well done thanks you [Music]", "WC5ceLoSy-U": "dymatize iso 100 hydrolyzed

what i mean by easy version it's because we're gonna use a store-bought ladyfingers and later on in another recipe i'll show you how to make ladyfingers from scratch but uh for the purpose of this video i just wanted to start with something simple and using a store bought lily fingers if we were to make the whole recipe from scratch it would take probably two hours but uh ninety percent of the work is actually goes into making those little cookies and so if you buy them in the store and i have to admit i'm guilty ninety percent of the time i i wanna make tiramisu i actually buy those uh because it's much more convenient if you're invited to to a party or something so um that being said uh so tiramisu is going to consist of eggs mascarpone cream vanilla coffee ladyfingers with a little bit of amerido for flavor and sugar of course so i would suggest i would recommend starting with the coffee so this is just instant coffee you can have an espresso in there if you want if you like it stronger and then we're going to add a little bit of america for flavor this is a almond-based alcohol so a dash of a merida or maybe two i mean it depends if it's for kids or for adult yes like one big dash of amerito and the reason why i prepare this first is because i want to give coffee the time to cool down so basically i'm going to mix that in make sure that the alcohol is fully incorporated and then i'm going to pour the coffee into this plate to make sure that it actually cools down because when we're going to soak the ladyfingers in it if it's too hot the ladyfingers are just going to melt and we don't want that we just want cold coffee there we go so we have our coffee and we're going to let it cool down on the side now next up um we you need two mixing bowls one to whip the egg whites and one for the egg yolks and the sugar a hand mixer with the whisk attachments i highly recommend first of all like getting one if you don't have one but i highly recommend actually using a hand mixer for this rather than a stand a stand mixer because you're it's it's not these are like it's a fairly small batch only three eggs and sometimes on a stand make sure the the the whisk doesn't cannot go all the way down to the bottom of the your bowl so for this we're just going to use a hand mixer so first step we're gonna separate the yolks and the whites right i'm gonna put the whites in a smaller one to make it easier to whip right that's one that's two it's very important to make sure that there is no egg yolk at all in the whites otherwise it it's very hard to to whip properly but if there's a little bit of egg white in the yolk that's not a problem the other way around is not a problem there we go i'm going to wash my hands real quick all right next up and before i get started i'm going to weigh the sugar and you're going to need 60 grams of sugar for this there we go if you like it sweeter you can add a little bit more uh i usually cut sugar quite a bit in my recipes so i i recommend starting with what i suggest here and then adjust depending on on what you need or your taste and if that's the only thing that we're going to have to weigh and everything else is is already taken care of so always start with whisking the egg whites because you don't want to have egg yolks or cream on your whisk and that saves some time on on clean up it shouldn't take very long and it's very quick you can start small like a low speed to make sure you have small bubbles smaller bubbles make for a more stable [Laughter] egg whites and it shouldn't take very long like maybe just 60 or 90 seconds at the most and make sure you go all the way down to the bottom we're at 40 seconds about half speed now you can increase the speed a little bit there we go and now notice we're getting there all right that was that was a full minute and now you can see the texture so the test the test to to check whether your egg whites are ready um is just to flip or to flip the the mixing bowl upside down and if it sticks at the like this is not a magic trick it's still in there right flip it around that means it's it's ready there's no more liquid at the bottom so we can set that aside for a moment i'm gonna put it here and now we're gonna prepare the second part so the second part we start with the egg yolks we add the sugar all of it and then we're gonna add a little bit of vanilla after we start the creaming process so no need to wash the whisks we can just go right ahead all right so after just a couple of seconds i just want to show i don't know if it's gonna look good on camera but this is very bright yellow right and so after you you you whisk it well you're gonna see you should turn much white whiter [Applause] oh [Applause] there we go that was a there was a minute as well and you see it's much more white that means all the sugar [Applause] is dissolved and it should feel like very very creamy right so that is step two now we can add our vanilla powder so it's based on your taste but just just a little bit oop at the bottom there we go a little bit heavy handed here but hey vanilla is good uh we're gonna mix that in two seconds there we go and now we're going to add mascarpone so a quick word on mascarpone i tried a lot of different recipes um and this one is the one i prefer because it's a little bit creamier has less moisture content i tried uh the whole food brand and some others and if you if you use different types of mascarpone you'll you'll get different types of humidity content and different types of texture eventually so depending on how you like your tiramisu if you like it creamier or a little bit more runny or a little bit more set you can either experiment with different brands to see which one gives you the texture that you're you're you're looking for or change the ratio of cream to eggs for instance now just grab everything pour it in there into the yolks with the sugar there we go make sure you grab everything from the container use your whiskey to to grab the last pieces and now we're going to mix the eggs and the cream together just 30 seconds you don't need more than that you're just just trying to blend everything together not really we're not whipping anything here just making the mixture well blended and very very creamy there we go now we're done with the hand mixer in the next step we will simply mix the two together the basically the the mascarpone cream with the egg yolks and the egg whites together so this is where we need to be like very gentle and we can't use the hand mixer for this because we have on one hand like one part that is very heavy and creamy right and uh the other part is quite fragile and we need to keep that foamy texture so we usually do it in three-thirds so you grab one-third of your egg whites and you gently fold what we we say we fold it so you go down to the bottom grab some cream and fold it on top of of the egg whites like this and make sure that all of the there's no pockets of unmixed egg whites before you add the second third and the final third there you go go all the way to the bottom turn it around bottom there we go there's no more egg whites and it's getting better and better so i'm gonna add the second third do the same thing don't don't mix it in like very quickly don't use a whisk really use a spatula go down to the bottom of the bowl and then fold it you fold it you fold it scrape the sides make sure you get all the cream you can break apart the whites to make sure it's fully mixed in and you see the texture is slowly changing so we're keeping the bubbles in i think we're ready for the last part so make sure you grab everything from the ball and we're going to do the final fold so as you've probably noticed by now we are not going to cook this so eggs maybe people don't realize what tiramisu is but it's basically just raw eggs sugar and cream this is not a dessert that is actually cooked except for the ladyfingers beforehand but which is why tiramisu is one of the few dessert where i actually exclusively use organic eggs and fresh that i just bought at the market today just for peace of mind because they're actually raw egg now as you can see i have my final texture here everything is mixed in there's no more egg whites and if i get closer you probably can see all the vanilla seeds in there that's one of the big difference between like using vanilla powder and like an extract or or anything else i mean this is this is gorgeous there we go so now my cream is actually ready i can do the final uh final step which is just getting everything put together i'm going to set that aside so i recommend getting a like a small dish now this is a just a glassware glass container and we're going to lay down some lighter fingers adding like a layer of fingers a layer of cream and then some chocolate powder and then another layer of ladyfingers chocolate cream and chocolate and there we go so let's start by using a glove all right grab one of these so you grab the lady fingers by now the coffee is probably cold which is what we're looking for and it's really just one two seconds on each side and then you should be good to go so one one and that's it and then down at the bottom one one if you let it soak too long especially if the coffee is too hot they're going to melt in your hands that's not what you're looking for one one done now at this point if you if you think you've you've been too quick and they're not soaked enough they're gonna be too crunchy at the bottom and not um not very soft you can always take a spoon and um grab a few like a grab some coffee and then add it on top like this if you think you need to be soaked a little bit more so don't don't don't pick them back up because at this point they're already too soft and then you can't you can pick them back up there you go there's enough in my container here i have enough room for four seven um and that's going to be good enough now i have only in a enough cream for two layers so basically i'm gonna put half of the cream that i've made inside of this i'm gonna try to i'm right-handed i'm gonna do left-handed for you guys there we go i'm gonna pour about half of the cream and there we go and use a an angled spatula to make sure it goes all the way to the bottom and that it's perfectly flat there we go this middle middle layer doesn't have to be very very flat because it's hidden anyway but try to be as precise as you can there we go next we're going to add some unsweetened cocoa powder dark unsweetened chocolate there's enough sugar already so you don't need to add more with the chocolate and this is a like a dispenser with a very very fine mesh on top to prevent clumps everything there overdo it it's very like unsweetened 100 cocoa powder is very very strong i recommend uh valrona or bari chocolate powder if you can there we go that's for the first layer and then we can go for a second another layer now if you make your own ladyfingers you can either go with the the same the same shape as you can see here but quite frankly if you're making tiramisu they don't need to be uh to have this size you can if you make your own your own cookies you can actually make entire sheets of of of ladyfingers like the exact same dough and you have you can make squares or or whatever the shape of your dish is to exactly fit the size of your dish you don't need to have individual cookies these are sold as individual cookies because they're they're also meant i mean designed to be eaten as is but they don't have to be individual cookies you can have any kind of shape you want there we go four and i know that i'm gonna need three more to finish it there we go one two three that's it right final layer i'm going to push all the others there we go second layer if you want you can um [Applause] be more creative and use different types of of of cookies uh in the middle layers and some people use uh speculos if you like cinnamon or butter cookies and so on and so forth but in our case we're just going to go with the like traditional classic ladyfinger recipe here all right okay guys and then you put the second part of your cream mixture on top there we go and this is for the chef for all the kids and use your spatula again push everything inside there we go and this is exactly the right amount so if you happen to have those snapware glass containers from costco well this is it this is exact quantity for one of the the big rectangular container there we go so uh final step this unfortunately is not ready to eat yet it's gonna have to spend a night in the fridge to make sure that cream actually sets and before serving we're going to add another layer of chocolate tomorrow on top do not add the chocolate now the final layer of chocolate otherwise the chocolate powder is going to become mushy and get absorbed by the cream so what you do instead is just grab your lid like we did for the crabs protect the cream put this in the fridge overnight and then you should be ready to go i'll see you tomorrow and by the way before we go uh i look at the video timer and we are at 27 minutes so this is something as i mentioned that is very easy to make if you have all the ingredients if you don't make your own ladyfingers you can make this dessert in less than 30 minutes so highly recommend it and see you tomorrow for the decoration final step for the tiramisu so it's been resting in the fridge overnight and now we're just going to add the final layer of chocolate powder and and cut it um that's it that's that's nothing more um this can comfortably serve like maybe six to eight people and we're gonna see how it looks like after i cut it so just uh light powder all the way across and then depends on on how you like it you might want to add more but don't overdo it what you can do as well if you want is actually serve the tiramisu on a plate and then add the chocolate powder directly on top so that's it this is our our tiramisu i'm going to quickly add cut this a small piece the the first um first part that you're going to take out is always uh the tricky the trick here so i'm just going to cut here and then a small piece there there we go now i'll grab maybe this and try to use another one there we go i'm gonna set this aside and show you how it looks like inside there two layers of ladyfingers and cream inside and it's fully set now it's fully set but very very very creamy still now at this point after you eat the tiramisu you can decide whether the ladyfinger layer is moist enough for you and if it's still too dry then you'll know next time to add more more coffee to this layer but it looks like it's it's just just the right texture at the moment let's see how it looks like um here there we go beautiful creamy sweet and a little bit of bitterness with the chocolate and the coffee oh you see the coffee oozing out that's good [Music] this is amazing i mean you've seen how simple it is to make i'm willing to bet that if you make this everybody's gonna tell you this is the best they've ever had no joke definitely better than most jeremy so you can find in restaurants around town like that's no contest that's it i'm going to finish this off screen and i'll see you next

these are going to be especially helpful for those of you who have a sweet tooth so if you want to hear what they are keep watching let's go so item number one is mushroom chips so this is gonna be a great alternative for those of you who like salty and crispy crunchy things like chips so this is gonna be a great switch out from potato chips to mushroom chips because they're gonna be much healthier lower in carbs higher in fiber and they're actually so so easy to make and you can make them at home in like a half an hour [Music] [Applause] so this is the finished product of the mushroom chips I know they may not look super appetizing at first but they taste better than they look especially with the hint of black pepper and pink salt so obviously the crisps penis will depend on how thin you cut the slices so as you can see some of these are pretty thin and chip like whereas some other ones are a little thicker because yeah I just cut them really fast so as you let them cool down they will get a little crispier when they go down okay so next is going to be for all of you hot chocolate lovers out there this is going to be a low-calorie zero sugar low carb alternative to hot chocolate so this is probably one of my favorite discoveries first thing I do is I use this almond breeze almond milk I mean you can use any brand but I like almond milk because hey I like the taste and it's only 30 calories per serving if you get the unsweetened I always get unsweetened this also has zero sugar as you can see [Music] this is the magic right here so this brown flavor god they make a bunch of zero calorie spices that you can use when cooking but they have this sweet flavor called chocolate donut [Music] [Music] so up next is another one of my favorite snacks that I like to have when I'm craving something a little bit sweet so I'm going to show you guys it's a little bit of a mix between sweet and savory not so much savory but I'll show you once you see you'll know why [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so last but not least the next one is probably my favorite discovery of all time even more so than the healthy hot chocolate so this one is going to be for when I'm craving something really sweet like ice cream for example halo top ice cream this is one of my favorite alternatives to ice cream healthier version so power crunch is a brand that makes protein bars and these are my absolute favorite protein bars there's the macros for you they do have some sugar in though but it is fairly low only 5 grams of sugar so with these if you like crunchy wafer textures like Kit Kats these are the best of course as you can see I finished the whole box a while ago already but how perfect are these flavors together halo top mint chip which is my favorite flavor as well as this chocolate mint it goes together so perfectly but since I don't have any more of these I had to grab a different flavor that I have left the cookies and cream which is really good as well it just doesn't match as good as this flavor would but that's okay also a pro tip put this in the fridge for about 10 minutes before so it gets nice and cold and hard because I'm going to show you what I'm about to do right now [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys so that wraps up my video for today hopefully you guys found these ideas interesting and helpful if you do try it let me know by leaving a comment down below and tell me what you thought of them thanks again for watching hope you guys have a great day bye", "fGZVROD-DEE": "i just love the flavor of tonka beans and i thought

I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative

humble bee and me and today we are whipping up a lovely perfect for summer passion fruit coconut body scrub the scrubby part of this scrub is white granulated sugar and then that is suspended in a beautiful rich creamy base the creamy base is primarily virgin coconut oil with a bit of passion fruit oil and then thickened with satirical alcohol the color of this scrub comes from a small amount of sea buckthorn oil but you could easily use an orange mica instead to get the color without needing to have that oil ten percent polysorbate 80 ensures the creamy base of this scrub rinses out of your bath really nicely so it's not slippery when you're done and also so you don't have to wash your bathtub right away now i chose not to whip this scrub if you do decide to whip it you're likely going to want to trade a few percentage points of fruit oil for a bit more satirical alcohol whipped products tend to melt much more readily if you think about a dollop of whipped butter on a piece of toast as opposed to a piece of solid butter the whipped one is going to melt faster so you're going to want to just turn up the melting point of the scrub a wee bit if you do decide you want to whip it if you're looking for more information on this formulation please make sure you are reading the partner blog post linked in the description box below i also recommend checking out other formulations i've shared for sugar scrubs on humblebme.com there are some versions that use different emulsifiers so you can use what you've got on hand alright let's go get our scrub on we'll begin by combining our heated phase ingredients in a small heat resistant glass measuring cup you'll need 10 grams polysorbate 80 17 and a half grams virgin coconut oil 8 grams passion fruit oil 13 grams ceteral alcohol and 0.75 grams sea buckthorn oil to melt everything together we'll be using a water bath so in this small saucepan i have about an inch or three centimeters of water and i'm going to pop our measuring cup in here and then go put this on the stovetop over medium heat for about half an hour to melt everything through once everything has melted you can remove your pan from the heat and then remove your measuring cup from the water bath so to cool this we are going to be using an ice bath so that's what this is here this is a small bowl where i've frozen about an inch of water on the bottom of it and then added about another inch of water on top so the first thing i'm going to do is add the sugar that'll help kind of start cooling things down so this is 50 grams of sugar and that's just regular white sugar that you would use for making cookies with or something like that don't use brown sugar it does need to be white sugar and you don't want it to be icing sugar either just plain old granulated white sugar so to start cooling this down i'm going to pop it in the water bath and stir continuously make sure you are scraping down the sides and wrapping around the bottom of the measuring cup and then feel free to you know pull the measuring cup out of the ice bath as needed to make sure things don't happen so quickly that you end up with solid chunks that you can't work back in [Music] once the mixture has cooled off a bit and has started to gain some viscosity we will weigh in our cool down phase you'll need half a gram of passion fruit fragrance oil or fragrance oil of your choice and a quarter of a gram vitamin e once you've reached trace we can package this up so you can determine that by if you pick up your spatula and kind of drop a few blobs back on the surface of it they'll leave a bit of a trace before a sinking for packaging i'm using this 100 gram white plastic jar [Music] now i'm going to go put this in the fridge for about an hour to set up once the scrub is fully set up in the fridge you can pull it out and let it come to room temperature and that's it so this is a version i made several days earlier so we can get a feel for that final consistency you can see that it is it's firm but you can you know press a finger through it and then scoop some up so really a really lovely final consistency for a bit of a use demo we can grab some of the scrub that was left over in the container we can add a little bit of water here so you can see it emulsifies into sort of a creamy lotion there on the skin really really lovely you can feel that sugar scrubbing around and then the scrubbing starts to diminish as the sugar starts to dissolve in the water and then when it comes time to rinse the scrub off it rinses off really really nicely as it self emulsifies with the water and there we go so we just made a really lovely passion fruit coconut body scrub thank you so much for watching please subscribe and please make sure you're reading the full blog post linked in the description box below you'll find a lot more information there including information about substitutions scaling shelf life where to buy all the ingredients and a whole lot more so thank you so much and i'll see you next time [Music] you", "KuGKs7tkU38": "welcome back and I do hope as ever you and your family are keeping well so what I want to look at today is the energy that you get from the food that you eat and we're going to look at calories or more importantly because energy is measured in joules we're going to look at the energy that you need to live and do all the things you do over a day in kilojoules and how much of that energy is in different types of food so before we look at some specific food items that you would eat and get your energy from I want to remind you very quickly about energy and how its measured so energy if you remember is measured in joules and one Joule is a very small amount of energy it's about the same amount of energy that you give to an apple when you lift it up by about a meter so if you were to pick an apple up off the floor and put it on the desk you've given it about one Joule of gravitational energy okay and it's a very small amount now you run around and you breathe and you do all the active things that you do in a day so you're gonna need to get from your food rather more than one Joule of energy in fact the Joule is so small we're going to measure the energy that you need in kilo joules in thousands of joules and an average teenager who's growing and is really active needs about 10,000 kilo joules a day so ten thousand thousand joules so that's about 10 million joules a day just to do all the things that you do as long as you're active of course now it's really confusing this because most people think of the energy in food when they eat it as being in calories and that's a very confusing and old-fashioned it so I'll mentioned calories in a minute briefly but as scientists as physicists we have to get away from calories and we have to think in the correct units in joules or thousands of joules in kilojoules so I brought in a few things from home to discuss here and I would do that if we're in class as well so we've still got a supply of pasta at home even though the supermarket's have completely run out at this time and if you look on the back of the packet of pasta there's a big table of numbers and one of the numbers on here is measured in calories it's really confusing and I kind of don't want to go into calories because quite often when people say you need a certain number of calories they actually mean you need a certain number of kilocalories so it's old-fashioned and the maths gets really confused with that so instead we're going to do everything correctly in joules or kilojoules and the labeling on the back is definitely correct when it comes to that now when you look at chocolate okay there's also on the back of that a table and it tells you how much Energy's in the chocolate so what I want to do is I want to have a look at these tables on the back of the items and explain how you can work out from them how much energy is in the food that you eat so I'm going to go up to the board in a minute and we'll look at things a little bit more closely okay so now let's have a look at the energy that you get from food so just remember that you guys all need energy to do things that's like run around and do all the sports and even just breathe and stuff like that okay and there's really only one place you get this energy from so you don't get it from sleeping oh I need more energy I think I'll sleep you get it from food so this energy comes from food the food that you eat okay now I think you're all pretty aware that if you get energy from food and it goes into you and you use that up with all the breathing and running around and shouting and things you do but of course if you don't have an active lifestyle and you still take in the same amount of energy then it's going to be stored in you as fat isn't it okay so you need to have some understanding about how much energy you need for your daily activities and how much energy you take in okay and we said that energy is measured in joules so measure and measure all your energy in joules okay now I know you're thinking well hang on I'd like to do that in calories or something but that's an old-fashioned measurement of energy so we're going to do it in joules the joules was too small wasn't it okay so we were going to measure in kilojoules so 1 kilo joule never missed that little K is the same as a thousand joules and if I wrote something like 6.2 kilojoules that would be 6200 jewels and naught point eight kilo joules would be 800 joules okay so don't miss out the kilo kilo means take this yeah and multiply it by a thousand so 0.8 times a thousand is 800 okay we then said that a teenager and other people as well Mountaineers and people who are very active will need energy every day just to live and to do all their activities and I'm making the number a little bit higher than it should be but you guys used to be so active when you were here at school and so you need approximately sir teenager needs approximately 10,000 kilo joules per day okay 10,000 kilojoules per day so ten thousand thousand ten million joules per day to do the things that you want to do okay and I did mention again that food packets seem to be obsessed with calories and when you read about dieting and all those sorts of things they talk about calories quite often they actually mean kilo calories and I just want to forget that completely okay we're going to work in the right units today so we're going to do all of our measurements in joules or kilo joules so let's now look at the labels that are on the back of different items of food and I'm going to get you to do some work on this a little bit later on now if you think about it if you buy a bar a chocolate the bars could be different sizes even though the chocolates the same inside so is it good to learn how much energy is in every different sized bar of similar chocolate or would it be easier just to know how much is in one portion that you should eat or maybe just in 100 grams because if you know how much energy is in a hundred grams then if you buy a 200 gram bar you know how much you got and if you buy a 400 gram bar you know how much you've got so we're going to look at what's on the back of these and how you guys can work out what the label means okay now the label is always going to be the energy you have to look carefully to find out where that is on the label the energy that we're going to look at properly is always going to be in kilo joules okay that's what physicists use the world over to measure energy and what you should find on the back is the amount of energy in 100 grams of the material now as far as I know that's law so even if this was a 50 gram bar of chocolate it has to have on the back how much energy in kilojoules so you can do some calculations for yourself and your diet how much energy is in a hundred grams now that doesn't mean you're going to eat a hundred grams of it it just means that you've got a fixed number so you can make some comparisons okay sometimes it gives the energy per serving okay now this is much more complicated this is the recommended amount that you should eat in one go okay so it varies for different things because you won't eat the same amount of different materials okay so some things that are very very lightweight or you might like a porter chips maybe you might eat the serving might be quite a large and for other things the serving might be quite small let's have a think about fish and chips okay so your serving of chips might be quite heavy okay so it might be a lot of grams and your serving of ketchup one serving might be a very small amount like your having one of those little pots but it's quite nice to know that if you eat one serving so you don't have a double portion how much energy is in one serving and for example okay let's say 150 grams so one of the packets I looked at said that one serving was a hundred and fifty grams so if I knew how much energy was in a hundred grams I can multiply by 1.5 so I know how much energy I'd eaten if I'd had one serving the other thing of course is that these numbers are on the packet never mind how big the packet is okay so it could be a massive catering pack of pasta or it could be a tiny little item okay it will just have to list how much energy is in a hundred grams of that material if you eat it and how much energy is in a hundred and fifty gram serving that you might have with a meal okay so I'm going to put on the screen now a packet of risotto rice it's quite posh so you must wonder what my partner's been paying for our household but what I'd like you to do and you might have to pause the video to have a look is I'd like to look closely at how heavy the pack is okay so can you find out how many grams the pack is yep and you should see that it's a 500 gram pack so it's a half-kilo pack let's have a look at how much energy is in 100 grams of this remember I think by law they have to tell you how much energy you'd find in a hundred grams and if you look carefully at the table you'll see that this rice has 495 kilojoules of energy in every hundred grams of the rice but 100 grams is a bit of a small amount to eat for dinner so if you were to eat one serving of this rice how much energy would you have taken in well you'll see that a serving is a hundred and eighty grams and you could either calculate it 1.8 times the previous number for a hundred grams or they have to give it for a serving of a hundred and eighty grams you would take on board 891 kilojoules of energy so if you want to know how much energy you've taken in by eating one serving of rice and you make sure it's the right amount then you know that you're on your way to your daily amount that you should have your ten thousand kilojoules of energy one serving of rice will have given you 891 kilojoules of energy so you've done you're on your way to sort of the amount that you should eat in a day okay just under a tenth of it it just begs the question you don't need to know this for GCSE just begs the question why is it a 500 gram box because if it's a 500 gram box and a serving is a hundred and eighty grams 180 doesn't go exactly into 500 it's only two point eight servings so maybe you could get just under three meals out of this box but it does seem rather weird so I'm going to put up on the screen now a packet of Doritos and it's the back of the packet where it lists the amount of energy in the Dorito crisps and what I'd like you to do is see if you can find so can you find okay firstly the energy per hundred grams what's that value okay and also can you find the energy per serving okay and it'd be nice for you to tell me how much a serving is so pause the video have a good look at the Doritos label and see if you can find out those three things so how much energy is in a hundred grams if you were to eat a hundred grams of Doritos how much energy is in a serving of Doritos and if you were to eat that serving how much would you have eaten how many grams of Doritos so pause the video write down what you think it is and I'll give you the answer in a moment so I hope you found your way around those labels now and there's an awful lot of numbers on them so the energy per hundred grams you got that number I'll come down here okay you have to look fairly closely but it was two thousand and seventy four kilo joules okay so that was the energy per hundred grams I hope you found out that one serving here was 30 grams okay so if you've got a bag of Doritos and it's more than 30 grams you perhaps shouldn't be eating the whole packet okay and you can either calculate or you can look on the packet for the energy for your 30 gram serving and I hope you found that one that was 622 kilojoules okay so I hope now you've got a really good understanding of how to find your way around these energy labels so it's time for a little challenge with a box of cookies so time for the cookie challenge so what I'm gonna do in a minute is I'm going to put on the screen a picture of the back of these cookies to show you the label that lists the energy stored in them okay and what I'd like you to do is to pause the video and have a good look at that label and I'd like you to answer some little questions to check you fully understand what we're doing before we finish the lesson okay so my first question is how many kilojoules per hundred grams are listed on the cookie box okay that's the number they kind of have to give you but then I'd like you to look at how many kilojoules per serving now you'll be perhaps disappointed to hear that according to the Box the surfing is one cookie okay so a serving is one cookie kind of weight saying cookie isn't it because we're not from America but biscuit one biscuit but the box calls them cookies so let's go with that okay now I've got one final challenge for you remember that you need remember how much energy you need as an active youngster to grow and do all the things you want to do okay well sort of about you need about 10,000 kilo joules per day okay let's be clear on what we mean by a day a day is 24 hours okay so it doesn't mean that when you go to bed you have to be another 10,000 kilojoules to keep you going through the night as it were okay but that's how much you need and we're going to set ourselves a really silly task okay let's assume that the only thing at the moment in your because everything's gone from the supermarket shelves the only thing is cookies and you got a big store of cookies okay so how many would you have to eat so how many cookies would you have to eat if yeah you only got your daily dose of energy from cookies and if you've answered the questions above here you'll have the information you need to work out exactly how many cookies you'd need to eat if that's the only thing you ate okay so pause the video now and work those things out and I'll come back to you with the answers in a minute okay let's see how you got on with the cookie challenge so you should be really good at finding your way around food energy labels now so how many kilojoules were there in a thousand grams of these biscuits cookies okay you should have found it was two thousand and seventy one kilo joules of energy that's quite a lot of energy if you think about it okay but one serving is rather less than eating a hundred grams of them okay so for one serving of one cookie it was five hundred and twenty eight killer joules of energy you would get from eating that and then my final question was and it's a bit of a silly one and don't do this of course it's not the way to get your energy if you just ate cookies and nothing else for 24 hours how many would you need to eat to give you your daily energy dose okay well you guys need approximately 10,000 kilojoules of energy per day and there are 528 kilojoules of energy in each biscuit so if you work that out you would need 19 cookies okay I can't remember how many was in the packet I think it was about eight so you'd have to buy a few more packets to get your daily energy dose okay but it's worth saying here that that's physics okay and there's a little bit of biology that comes in as well you must remember to eat a balanced diet okay so sitting on the couch firstly you're not burning off energy okay so get up from your computers and actually do some stuff and run around okay and secondly if only cookies just cookies biscuits were the things that you ate during the day okay you wouldn't have a balanced diet okay now that's not physics that's the biology side but you wouldn't be getting the vitamins and the fiber and all the other stuff you need so you can do the physics maths but you need to know a little bit more of biology to work out that you should eat a balanced or rounded diet where cookies might play a little bit of a part in it so I do hope you found that video useful and you now have a really good understanding of how to work out how much energy is in the food that you eat remember it's no good eating just chocolate to get the calories you need you need a balanced diet and of course if you eat a lot of calories you've got to burn them off you've got to use them off so keep doing all the activities you do try and do as much sport as you can and you'll stay fit anyway I'll be making another lesson soon and I look forward to seeing you then you", "8z6AkLGo_KU": "[Music]", "whRjzv9Kcpo": "by replacing your snacks with healthier options you're not only going to not feel the guilt of having the full calorie fat versions of these foods but you're gonna feel super satisfied because you won't be constantly thinking about those cravings [Music] what's up sarah squad welcome back to my channel lose weight sarah where i'm on a mission to lose 100 pounds my way when you're trying to lose weight finding snacks that don't suck can be a real challenge now most people are going to tell you to swap your regular snacks with fruits and veggies now there's nothing wrong with fruits and veggies they are obviously a very important part of living a healthier lifestyle they're going to keep you full longer and they have all kinds of other nutrient benefits but you can't tell me that carrot sticks and cherry tomatoes are ever gonna replace a flamin hot cheeto it's just not realistic now if you're like me and spent the last decade or so of your life sitting on the couch with a bag of chips at your side you know that those cravings for those salty crunchy snacks are really legit the good news is there are a bunch of different options that you have when it comes to making better choices to replace the snacks you already love by replacing your snacks with healthier options you're not only going to not feel the guilt of having the full calorie fat versions of these foods but you're gonna feel super satisfied because you won't be constantly thinking about those cravings so today we're gonna be in my kitchen and i'm gonna show you three of my favorite snack alternatives that totally don't suck let me tell you guys i used to absolutely demolish an entire bag of smart food in one sitting while i was watching a movie at 160 calories and 10 grams of fat per serving that quickly adds up to about a freaking day's worth of calories fortunately jolly time healthy pop 100 calorie bags exist and they are a convenient way to enjoy popcorn without the gilt or the cheesy white finger coating you can even add low or no calorie toppings like this white cheddar sprinkle stuff that i have here only adds a few extra calories maybe two to four total but you don't even honestly need it the popcorn by itself is just so good and it's a very satisfying crunchy snack ah the classic chewy chips ahoy cookie the chips ahoy cookies have an absolutely laughable serving size of two cookies for 140 calories and six grams of fat it doesn't help that this tray style packaging practically sends you a written invitation to eat an entire row if not more which adds up to a whole lot of empty calories but luckily we have fiber one soft baked chocolate chip cookies to the rescue these cookies clock in at 130 calories and four and a half grams of fat per cookie but you have the added bonus of an additional five grams of fiber possibly their greatest strength is that they are individually packaged so not only is that really convenient but you'll be way more conscious about how many you're opening versus the tray style of the chips ahoy where you could just easily grab a whole entire row of them i happen to love these fiber one cookies they're super tasty they taste almost exactly like a chips ahoy you might not notice and i know there's not a humongously significant calorie difference between the two snacks but that extra added fiber and a little protein definitely does make a difference you guys had to know this was going to be on my list because i talk about it all the freaking time now i don't know what it is about the ridiculous spiciness that i love so much but flamin hot cheetos are by far one of my favorite snacks ever when i first started trying to lose weight i had pretty much sworn these off for good because i knew that at 170 calories and 11 freaking grams of fat per serving there was no way i was going to be able to fit these into my lifestyle change but then something happened call it fate call it destiny or call it my dumb ass just absolutely never noticing them in the store before but i discovered that the angels over at frito-lay offered a baked version which is a much more calorie-friendly alternative of the fiery goodness that is flame and hot cheetos coming in at only 140 calories and 5 grams of fat per serving these are a spicy snack that i can fit into my calorie budget once or twice a week with absolutely zero guilt now please don't come at me in the comments trying to tell me that i'm telling you to eat baked cheetos all the time that is simply not the case these are just some lower calorie alternatives and i think it's important when you are trying to make a lifestyle change that you not only adopt healthier habits but you also find alternatives to the types of foods that you already like i really do believe that you can eat anything in moderation as long as you make smart choices and these are just a few examples of choices that i have made to reduce my calorie intake now you guys all know that i am a big fan of everything in moderation i don't believe that any foods should be completely off limits you should be able to eat the things you enjoy just smaller portions and in control of your calories finding these lower calorie lower fat alternatives to some of my favorite snacks have definitely helped me succeed in my journey to lose 100 pounds as you guys know i've lost a little over 35 pounds in the last year and i'm still going strong tell me in the comments below what are some of the alternative snacks that you've found to substitute to help you lose weight and keep your calories in check also let me know in the comments below if you would like to see more videos like this one this really only scratches the surface of the types of food swaps i've done to cut calories

[Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "cecZu0hZGrs": "[Music] [Music] yes hi everybody hope you all okay today we wanted to show you how we make our chocolate brownies I'm going to give you the recipe and do a little cook along and just explain the ingredients I use and why besides using the best quality ingredients that you can there's also a technique to make in the best brownies and I wanted to show you how I make mine so that you can hopefully make some of your own at home let me first of all just talk you through the ingredients the quantity of the ingredients that you will need are 185 grams of unsalted butter 185 grams of dark chocolate maybe 54% from above at 275 grams of caster sugar 3 free-range large eggs 85 grams of plain flour 40 grams of cocoa powder and 100 grams of milk chocolate or white chocolate whichever is your choice you also need a baking tin a brownie tin the one I use is a line by 8 inch tin lined with baking parchment so this is the ingredients that I use for my brownies I've got shipped to mell organic flour that's a very high quality flour it works perfectly every single time I've got 54.5% dark chocolate you could buy something from the supermarket and it'll be absolutely fine just make sure it's got the high cocoa content obviously Dairy Milk everybody knows that one cocoa organic free-range eggs where possible the only thing that I wouldn't normally use is this castor sugar I normally use a golden caster sugar but at the moment I can't actually get hold of that so this is just a normal one and the butter when you're buying better try and choose one that's got a high fat content if you look on the back of the packet it'll tell you and you want to try and get one it's got a minimum of 82 percent fat that way you've not got all the water that's been added to it and you'll get a much better baked and to start making your brownies you need to measure 185 grams of your dark chocolate and 185 grams of your better pop them into a bun Marie or if you haven't got that you can microwave them just do them at intervals of abates or 30 seconds at a time because you don't want to burn the chocolate and you need it to be it is all melted together while that's mounting if you weigh 40 grams of cocoa and 85 grams of the flour into a bowl and just pop it to one side once the chocolate has melted leave it to one side and you can begin to whisk your eggs and sugar together to do this I always use my handheld electric whisk you could use your if you've got a can wood mixer whatever you've got what you want to do is combine the eggs and the sugar together to get as much air in them as possible continue to do this for about three to eight minutes until they become very thick creamy and you can make it a kind of ribbon pattern on the top that will stay on the top of their mixture for a few seconds so you've got to this stage of the egg and sugar mixture you can add your melted chocolate and butter to this mix to mix it together you want to be quite careful because you've tried to incorporate as much air into the mix already so you don't want to be then locking that eye once you add the chocolate so I just use my spatula and work in a kind of figure of eight motion most of the time to try and mix it together just do it until it's just combined once you've got to this point if you add your if you see if your flour and cocoa powder into the mix and then use your same spatula again to combine it it's gonna look quite grainy to start with go with it keep going but don't try and over mix it because this is where you're going to end up with quite a dense heavy brownie and last but not least you add your hundred grams of milk chocolate you could use any chocolate you'd like white chocolate whatever you fancy really or whatever you've got I just chop it into quite decent sized pieces and add this to the mix and just very very briefly once you've added all of the ingredients you're ready to pour the mix into your tin I always use a 9 by 8 in line up baking paper and it worked perfectly every time minused in now it's ready to go into the preheated oven I always do mine on 160 degrees because I've got a fan oven if yours isn't a fan just go for 180 degrees and I'd be absolutely fine I bake it for 25 minutes precisely and it never fails those of you that have been following us for some time you'll remember that we've got our vintage coffee van that unfortunate at the moment because of the circumstances were unable to do so to try and keep the business go in and to be able to offer everybody a tree where we can we've decided to set up an online shop so you're able to go on to our site and purchase I'm going to have a choice of at the moment chocolate brown is baked wa tart or millionaire shortbread which I hope that I can add two more as we go along to buy these you can purchase it online and then we can send it to you in the post obviously we can only do this to UK addresses at the moment because without using any preservatives it's just not going to be how I would want you to receive it if it's traveled in the post for days on end to buy in the UK we're going to use Royal Mail first-class so we hope that that's going to be with you within a couple of days of me making it which should ensure that your brain is will be very fresh or whatever it is you thought everything's going to be made fresh to order so when you receive it you could freeze some of it if you wanted to which would obviously prolong its life if it would last that long in your house it's certainly granite in hours I know we decided to do the shop online obviously to keep the business alive also because I've had quite a few requests I've even had requests for Christmas puddings already which is quite interesting and definitely submit that we could pursue as the year goes on if you wanted to purchase our cakes we'll just have a look what we're doing please go to the link that's in the video description below and also I hope to add more things to this site maybe some granola I think we're thinking of maybe doing some out of flour cordial next month if you've got anything else that you specifically would like maybe give us a message and we can see what we could do the tea company bird and blend have kindly donated me some tea bags to be able to include a free sample in every box of cakes that I sell so for a limited time while the stocks last everybody that orders a box of cakes will also get a free sample of tea they're a great company and they do some very very interesting tea blends they've got a lot of different recipes online and all of their teabags are a hundred percent plastic free and biodegradable there's only gonna be a set amount of quantities on their site each week so obviously I need to be able to keep up with a demand but please keep checking back if you can't get what you want immediately or message me and then I can let you know when I'm gonna have the next batch available I hope you've enjoyed this video and maybe I've inspired you to bake some of your own or to want to come along and purchase one of our so you can enjoy it at home in the future I hope to make some more videos let me know if there's something that you really want me to make an a see what I can do okay take care bye [Music] Hey let's know the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see the

"Xr3vcPUcjs4": "almond butter is a delicious plant-based source of proteins and healthy fat and while you can certainly buy it at the grocery store there is nothing quite like homemade plus I think you guys are gonna be really surprised to see just how easy it is to make your stuff all you're gonna need are some almonds and a food processor and if you like your army butter salted you're gonna want a little kosher sea salt as well now I have three cups of raw organic almonds spread out on a rimmed baking sheet and I'm gonna pop these into a 250 degree oven for about 15 minutes I have found that when you're making the almond butter if you work with warmed almonds it actually helps them break down a little bit faster and I think that's because when they're warm the oils release more easily plus I like when they get that deep roasted flavor now if you were already starting with roasted almonds then you would just pop them in the oven for about 8 or 10 minutes until they have warmed all the way through once I've got them heated through and they have a nice golden brown color I'm just gonna transfer these into my food processor pop on the lid and then I like to start them with a few pulses just to break the almonds down and then I just put it on and let it begin to blend from here most of the dirty work is gonna be happening in the food processor now this whole process is going to take about 15 to 20 minutes so what you want to keep in mind is number one keep an eye on your food processor because you just want to make sure that it doesn't get too hot so that it doesn't overheat now mind you this has never happened to me personally but it's just something to keep in mind and number two every now and then you're gonna want to shut it off and scrape down the sides if you see the almonds starting to stick to the south right this is also a good time if you wanted to give your food processor a break just wait a minute or two before you turn it back on now at first your almonds are gonna look like almond meal almost like an almond flour just like this then you're gonna begin to notice that it starts to come together a little bit more it's gonna start sticking to the sides you're gonna scrape it down then you're gonna notice that's gonna start to form into a ball and this is what I like to add the salt so if you like salted almond butter I like to add a half a teaspoon of kosher sea salt get that in break it up pop the lid back on and one last round and you are gonna have this creamy smooth delicious beautiful homemade almond butter check that out now from here your almond butter is ready to be stored and I find the best way to store it is in some type of airtight container in my opinion a mason jar is the perfect container to use you could also use an old nut butter jar that you just rinsed out and are ready to use again so transfer the almond butter into your jars pop the lids on and you're gonna see this makes about one and a half cups of almond butter and the way to get the most life out of it is to store it in the fridge this almond butter will last you up to a month in your fridge you have to remember that almonds are very sensitive the oils in the almonds can actually go rancid so keeping it in a nice cool dark place is the best way to get the most shelf life out of your almond butter then you will have fresh homemade on the butter waiting for you whenever you're ready you could stir a little bit into your oatmeal put it on your morning toast mix it into your yogurt put it on top of some fresh fruits like apples or bananas the options are truly and it's or you can make my brownies where my cookies so many options guys you have got to get in the kitchen and try to make your own almond butter it is mind-blowingly

won't be pies good let's see see you later let's get started we're gonna use 1 cup of quest protein powder this is the multi-purpose mix love this stuff you will too if you start using it 1/2 a cup of almond flour that's 6 net carbs 2 tablespoons of coconut flour we have 1/4 cup cocoa powder you can use whatever put cocoa powder you like this is just what I've got we also must do the dry greens first we've got a large pinch of salt a teaspoon of baking powder and I'm just gonna mix these dry and get greediness together so I'm gonna have 4 tablespoons of butter you can use regular eggs and you can use the yolk I just have this little ham so maybe you use a quarter cup of this all white egg 1/4 cup of egg whites or you would use equivalent which would probably be an extra-large egg now I'm gonna put a quarter of a cup of cream and I forgot the sugar doesn't matter crying greedy yeah it's liquid Sugar's considered a liquid ingredient some people say it's dry but it's actually when it melts it's a liquid like sugars that this I'm using bucks monks fruit in the wall now you would use whatever sweetener you like but remember how whether yours a sweeter like Splenda is much sweeter than the monk fruit if you're using stevia it's not a sweet seven this is a half cup look how nice this one does some nice I love a good dough now at this point you just take a tablespoon so let's get on with filling in here I've got three ounces of Philadelphia Cream Cheese you don't have to measure if you don't know there's another line on the side see that and they are for a chance cuz each box has eight ounces so that you'll see it woke up so you don't have to weigh that out so in in here I've got a tablespoon of butter that one a little bit more nimble tablespoon one teaspoon of vanilla extract and I've got three tablespoons of muck fruit in the row I'm using just the tiniest bit a small pinch of salt I've got three tablespoons here of cream no I'm just gonna blend all this together

coloring in there you can put as much in there as you want we'll make him really green and we're going to mix it into the whipped topping take the spatula round the sides and then gently come over at

loves them and they're super easy I'm going to talk about them right after this hey guys welcome to ad Kido my name is Erin this is the channel where you can watch a weird dad work his way through the ketogenic diet I do some key to eating vlogs and do some keto project reviews every Sunday I have a talk with my wife Sarah about her keto experience and I do some keto giveaways if this is your first time here please consider subscribing and if you do make sure you're on notification squad by clicking the bell alright guys it's time to talk about these these are the fat bombs that I make for Sarah pretty much every week to 10 days and they could not be more simple I've got a lot of comments recently about ooh give us that fat bomb recipe can you post the fat bomb recipe water Sarah's favorite fat bombs what are Sarah's default that bombs like so here's a video about those fat bombs and they really could not be easier I'll actually show you how I do them I'm gonna keep talking here but I'll roll some footage that I shot of me making them first you start with a liquid measuring cup that will hold at least two two cups of liquid and you put some coconut oil in there about a cup of coconut oil you put it in the microwave to melt it down here I thought it would only take 30 seconds but in fact it took 60 so I had to give it a couple 30-second blasts in the microwave and then add your favorite low-carb / natural peanut butter the one I use is from a company called Santa Cruz it's their creamy light roasted peanut butter and it's only got 2 grams of net carbs per serving so this is what I use and I just dump it in until everything comes up to about two cups I shortchanged it here it's only about a cup and three quarters then I add just a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa and a tablespoon of confectioner's style swerve I used to use granular swerve but I found that it would settle a lot in the bottom of the measuring cup so I use confectioner's now it seems to mix up a little bit better and stir it all up and then just for good measure sometimes this is optional but you can put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds or so so that it it's super horrible because you're basically gonna take a fat bomb mold and dump this stuff into the fat bottom mold and here is a killer tip that I learned years ago from man mega Aikido Connect they said when you're making bat bombs be sure to put your fat bomb slash silicon mold into the ice cube tray ahead of time because if you try to fill up a fat bomb mold and then pick it up and it's doing this while you're trying to like put it in the freezer it's gonna be a mess so take the ice cubes out of the ice cube tray put your fat bomb mold into the ice cube tray and then fill it up so this fat bomb mold is perfect it makes it usually holds just about all of this mixture just dump them in until it's all full and then throw them in the freezer and that's where I keep them actually when they're done they end up looking like this and you can keep them in the freezer and they're a nice little snack here are the macros for them each one of these is about 162 calories about 2.5 total carbs about 1.2 grams of fiber and about 0.8 sugar alcohols from the swerve that gets you down to about 0.4 to 0.5 net carbs per fat bomb also about two and a half grams of protein and 16 and a half grams of fat and they're absolutely delicious Wow snappy so again these are our default fat bombs you can maybe add a little bit more swerve we can maybe lean a little bit more on peanut butter than coconut oil and you can do something which I have started to do recently is only make half a batch of this cocoa portion fill each of the cavities of the fat bomb mold only halfway then put it in the freezer then take it out and what I did last time is I took some macadamia butter and if I had known better I probably would have combined the macadamia butter with some coconut oil but this last time I did I just used macadamia butter all of it and I filled the rest of the cavities after the initial layer had solidified I dumped the macadamia butter dumped I poured the macadamia butter on top of the you know half-full cavities and then put that back in the freezer and they came out this cool little two-tiered fat bomb so a lot of different stuff you can do with these you could probably even add instead of cocoa powder maybe some different flavorings you know maybe a you know peppermint extract or something at the holidays there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do with it this is kind of just a baseline basic fat bombs that we make that I make let me know if you make them let me know if and how you modify them on top of this base sort of recipe and that's gonna wrap it up for this video guys I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a fantastic day and I'll see you next time [Music] alright alright alright alright alright alright dubbed the dub [Music]", "3EYOwJ_obzc": "hey y'all welcome to my youtube channel today I wanted to share a quick and easy 5-minute keto dessert recipe so picture this you just had a fabulous dinner and you know what you get a sweet tooth you don't have time to throw together a big dessert you want something right here right now to satisfy that sweet tooth so if you are ever in that predicament I wanted to share this quick and easy chocolate mousse recipe all it takes is four ingredients in less than five minutes to throw together this is a recipe that when you make it you are gonna want to consume it immediately because the mousse will fall but you can throw it together in a pinch you probably have all the ingredients on hand so let's hop right into this recipe the four ingredients that you're going to need is some heavy whipping cream unsweetened cocoa powder vanilla extract and a sugar-free sweetener today I am using this monk fruit sweetener but feel free to use any other brand of sugar-free sweetener such as swerve or stevia Splenda whatever you use in your normal low carb baking use your sweetener you don't have to go buy anything special for this recipe now grab yourself a mixing bowl and a hand mixer and let's get started add one cup of heavy whipping cream into your mixing bowl one teaspoon of vanilla extract now we're gonna add one to two tablespoons of sugar free sweetener I'm gonna go with about one and a half tablespoons and lastly we're gonna add in two tablespoons of our unsweetened cocoa powder now that we have all of our ingredients in our mixing bowl you can either take a hand mixer or if you're fancy and have one of those like stand mixers you can mix it in that as well but I'm cheap and I have my $15 hand mixer so you're just gonna blend this baby up until stiff peaks form after about three minutes of mixing you can see that our heavy cream has now whipped into stiff peaks so it is ready to be served you can just scoop this out onto a plate and eat it like so or you can put it into a piping bag and make it look all cutesy wutesy and I think I am going to make it look cutesy fitzy someone is very upset because he thinks this recipe is for him and it's not he also got a haircut today and by haircut they just trimmed his face and legs because he still looks like a fluffy little polar bear look at that he's so cute but we can see your face that's very exciting what I did was put some of my mousse into a pastry bag with a wide tip on the end and we're just going to squeeze it out and make this into a nice little swirly shape like so although I'm not very good at this y'all so it looks not very pretty mmm doesn't that look appetizing maybe I should have got a bigger tip for my piping bags because that does not look appetizing at all okay maybe just serve it by scooping it into a bowl that works too apparently my new year's resolution should be to work on my plating skills because I have none but there you go this is how to whip up a five-minute keto chocolate mousse

protein packs seeing the chocolate chip cookies hopefully they're going to be super yummy so that they live up to the name yummy Monday's I have happy hemp raw gluten three have seeds to use in the recipe because every single week without fail people ask me especially people who are trying to build muscle where do you get your protein from and plant-based diet and I have to tell you there's a bajillion places together today we're gonna be focusing on hemp seeds and making delicious cookies so it's a snap that also gives you your protein I had the ingredients for you I'm going to list them right now so that you can probably along with me I got this recipe from my friends at Happy Chef calm and you can go there too and visit them we're going to start by preheating our oven to 350 we're going to take our softened butter and we're going to cream our butter and sugar until fluffy my egg I'm gonna see those for my composter a teaspoons of vanilla and then in a separate Bowl what we're gonna add our flour our salt baking soda and the hemp seeds those together once that's nice we're still go ahead and decide in to the other mixture and then we were all done mixing that we're going to go ahead and fold in six ounces of our semi-sweet chocolate chips and then the last step is to take big spoonfuls of your mixture and place it on your cookie sheet make sure they're evenly spaced so they can spread out nicely I believe that these are going to turn out great then we're going to go ahead and stick them in the oven for five minutes rotate the pan for another five minutes and hopefully everything turns out fantastic oh all right let's put on my floors now you can make these completely vegan by substituting only two of the ingredients instead of using egg you can use applesauce and instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips you can use dark chocolate just make double sure to read the ingredients so that you know that there's no dairy products in it okay these are completely cooled out I'm gonna try them out I promise to give you my absolute honest opinion and let's see how this a chocolate cookie there it is this perfect protein-packed chocolate-chip cookie complete with little tiny grow hemp seeds inside it totally if you see oh so", "N0MMBstCcs0": "hello my name is Carrie welcome to my tiny little kitchen I have been cooking today we are making toasted pecan lemon coconut macaroons to begin I have lined a small cookie sheet with aluminum foil I have two cups of the cons we're going to place at the pawns in a single layer on the cookie sheet and we have two tablespoons of butter and I'm going to cut that into small pieces to put on top of the pecans our recipe only calls for a half a cup of chopped pecans but I always cook extra because the extra pecans are wonderful on top of salads or to snack on by themselves even on top of ice cream or yogurt I'm using unsalted butter and i'm going to add half a teaspoon of sea salt i preheated the oven to 300 degrees so that it would be ready for the pecans to go in usually you want to pre-heat your oven at least 10 minutes before you start cooking so now our pecans are ready to go into the oven we will set our timer for 10 minutes next we need two egg whites I'm going to separate the egg window we want to be careful not to get any yolk into the whites or they won't be well you can save the egg yolks and add them to a batter to make french toast or two homemade vanilla pudding or even add them to the egg mixture for making an omelet I'm going to place these egg yolks into the refrigerator I have lemon extract we're going to add the one-fourth of the teaspoon of lemon extract to our egg whites and we're going to beat the egg whites until soft peaks form so I'm going to beat them on high and then I'll show you what soft peaks look like so we've beat the egg whites to soft peaks and now we're going to gradually add two thirds of a cup of sugar while we're still beating the egg whites until all the sugar is added and the egg whites are stiff and stand straight up and little Peaks when you remove the blender so beating on high our timer just went off so i'm going to remove the pecans from the oven they've been cooking for just 10 minutes i'm going to stir them we don't want them to burn or get to brown they already smell very good when you roast or toast nuts it just gives them a very nice crisp crisp miss and a nice aroma okay we're going to put these back into the oven for another 7 to 10 minutes I'll keep my eye on them to make sure that you don't get too dark set our timer and we finished with our egg whites they are a bright white glossy and you can see now our egg whites are beaten into stiff peaks it stands straight up when you lift the beaters out and the egg whites are a bright white glossy color we're going to add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to our egg whites these are going to have a nice lemony flavor next we're going to take a greater it has a course great and a fine great we're going to use a fine great and we're going to great just the yellow part of the lemon pill very finely we need to add 1 tsp of finely grated lemon peel show our macaroons now the timer went off so it's time for the nuts to come out and we'll let them cool before we chop them and we're going to increase the oven heat to 325 degrees you don't want to get the white part just the limit the yellow part of the lemon the white part can be a bit bitter so I did a little bit more than one teaspoon just because i really like lemon and i am making these cookies especially for my mother-in-law Jen Duda who likes pecans likes coconut and really likes lemon as well so our lemon peel is in there and we have one and one-third cups of flaked coconut will stir those in our pecans have cooled down enough that we can handle them so now I'm going to chop them we need just a half of a cup of chopped pecans to add to our lemon and coconut macaroons ok need a little bit more here we have our half a cup of pecans we'll stir those in at least once a day usually more than once a day i disinfect the tile and I always add bleach to my dish soap to also disinfect my dishes to make sure that there's a very high standard of cleanliness I've lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper you can use parchment paper if you like I prefer it and then I'm going to lightly grease the parchment paper with butter so you either would face the parchment paper or you would grease the pan directly and now we're going to use two teaspoons to measure out our cookie dough actually little meringues these are very very light it's almost like taking up and bite of a cloud and so just one teaspoon and then you use the other teaspoon to slide the meringue onto the cookie sheet and when we have a full cookie sheet we'll get these into the oven the timer just went off and our first tray of macaroons are ready to come out of the oven we'll put our next tray in and we'll set our timer for 20 more minutes this recipe makes about two and a half dozen cookies so just 30 cookies if you like them a lot or want to make them for gifts for people you might want to double the recipe I have allowed these macaroons to cool on the cookie sheet for a little bit more than five minutes and that makes them easy to remove so now we can let them finish cooling completely on a cooling rack before we package them up here's how the bottom looks here's how the top looks they're very light and airy on the inside and crispy on the outside I save containers from restaurants and from the grocery store so when these cookies had finished cooling i will put some in a container for my mother-in-law and we're going to go visit my father-in-law and mother-in-law tomorrow afternoon for lunch and they'll be very happy when we show up with homemade cookies our first tray of macaroons has cool and I've put some into my container for a gift I cut a square of wax paper to put in between layers of cookies so they won't stick to each other this is what the cookies look like and now I'm filling up the container for my in-laws and I have a nice tasty little treat to bring

"hey what's up everyone today I'm reviewing this it is the M&Ms ice cream cookies basically it's an ice cream cookie sandwich made with cookies with M&Ms inside my daughter picked this out at the grocery store today and this was about three dollars and fifty cents for this box of six not too bad for a per unit cost what do we got going on here mmm ice cream wow this is a decent sized ice cream cookie guys one that you would come to expect I would say one to a little bit over two inches in diameter a little bit over an inch and a quarter in thickness we got some vanilla ice cream in the middle and we got some actually surprisingly moist and soft cookie on the outside normally some of these things are like hard and chewy this one like I'm holding it with my hand and my fingers can push in the cookie that's kind of cool let's see how it tastes these are not normal size M&Ms guys these are mini sized M&Ms so keep that in mind super soft moist cookie here's a problem when you don't have moist cookies you bite into it and then it pushes down and on the back side the cookie pops up and you don't have the it's squirts ice cream out the side because this is so soft and moist when I bit into it look cuz all the way through mmm yep bit all the way through that's decent the cookie has a good saltiness to the cookie batter all it's real good cookie eaters know that the amount of salt that's added to the cookie makes the cookie I know it sounds counterintuitive but really salt is what makes it this is like a chocolate chip cookie batter the right amount of saltiness and a good chocolatey chocolatey Ness of the mmm I really like the cookie on the outside of the ice cream in the middle not really anything to write home about guys in fact it's got a consistency that is almost like it's not full ice cream it's not like it's almost like soft-serve consistency almost like a like a picture of meringue or some sort of like like icing cream that is a little thicker than regular cream but not as thick as ice cream does that makes sense it's kind of a cheap vanilla ice cream on the inside that being said I don't mind it too much because the cookie is still amazing this is not one of those situations where you're like I'm buying the M&M cookie ice cream cookie because of the ice cream it was one of those situations where you're like I'm buying this because it has pretty awesome cookies and a nice cold burst of something fresh on the inside so don't buy this if you like ice cream buy this because you like a cold ice cream like cookie sandwich and you love you some M&Ms this is the mmm ice cream cookies although I might add because it's so chewy what's soft I hate to see what type of crazy preservatives are in that cookie that's typically what happens with that that being said overall experience three and a half out of five star rating question of the day sorry I just gotta get well that's good stuff off I mention about the soft cookie how do you like cookies it doesn't have to be ice cream cookies but do you like crispy thin cookies like a little brown on the bottom or do you like nice and soft and chewy cookies leave that in the comment section remember soft batch cookies those things were like crazy soft that the head is like art official taste to it so you're kind of like well maybe it shouldn't be that soft however if you're making homemade cookies it's super nice when it's nice and warm and soft so anyway leave that in comics session how geez I can't talk today leave that in the comment section how you like cookies if you like

friend came back to do another review for y'all today got something interesting for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there we've got a pax era pod for the old packs era coming from Soleil it's Salette unplugged this is a hybrid strain that's coming in at six hundred and seventy three milligrams THC and ninety seven point three one milligrams CBD so it's hitting about seven sixty seven percent THC in about nine percent maybe ten percent CBD not much yeah I've tried this before and flower from Soleil it's always been pretty satisfying before it's their version of rock star cush unplug so really eager to try it out in a packs air pod it's 0.5 gram pod it's like a 510 threaded cart but you use it for the packs Eric comes in these little pods like this and you just put it on there and away you go works a lot like a jewel like a jewel nicotine device just like an e-cigarette same thing same device same idea in fact it's the same company jewel started out as pax labs and broke off into jewel so pretty innovative product pretty cool I haven't seen a lot of these around really wanted to try it out ever since bought my pax era down when I was in Oregon tried a whole bunch of pods out down there in Washington love the thing been really eager for it to show up in Canada and finally I got my hand on a few of these pots so we're gonna check this one out today I just want to show you on the side here it shows that it's a hundred percent plant-based ingredients so any added terpenes are plant-based and not artificial so it's good to know that it's a bit of a unique package here let me just also show you here at the packaging date is December 5th 2019 so it is what June 3rd so it's been sitting around for a little while but it should be okay I think yeah it's an area company so a the one oh yes what I wanted to show you was packaged it's it's unique it's weird so it says here push finger through circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly in continue holding tab pull and flap to open like there's a little bit complicated here for something that is a pod that's about this big let's check it out so tells us to push here alright and hold tab in and pull huh I don't understand so you hold this in and you pull this part out it's not very easy to open so push finger through help push and hold the inner tab firmly in hmm very strange packaging design here by some way we're just gonna rip it open cuz this is nuts nice job alright so once you get inside this insanely labyrinthine nutso packaging here completely unnecessary by the way oh you get your little slave packs pod so there you go it's got the THC logo on there as you're all used to assess branded with so late um doesn't say unplug anywhere on there you can see this is what the oil looks like in these packs air pods it doesn't look like a lot but there's 0.5 grams in there and I've had these before they're pretty concentrated they're pretty good the ones I've had before so all you do is you take this off you're not if you have one on take your packs error make sure it's fully charged take it just like a jewel device put it on there you go it lights up it's ready to go um you know unfortunately I would love to show you the app that goes with this but it's really not set up for the Canadian market yet what a cool feature on this is you can go in here and you can look for the pod that you've bought choose it and select certain temperatures it's not set up for Canada at all yet it only shows states in the United States where it's illegal and in fact even searching for Canadian LPS or any products comes up with no result it's really disappointing that you know the releasing packs pause in the Canadian market and their app isn't even set up for it yet because it is a pretty cool app I've used it for the American pods before it comes with sort of preset temperatures for each pod for best flavor best vapor it's kind of cool neat little temp temperature settings in there kind of cool um I just got it set to sort of a basic temperature right now I actually can't remember what temperature the last pod was but we're just gonna rip on this and see what it's like straight out of the box right into the pack Sara whoa Wow dad there's a lot of taste going on here it's very fruity uh first thought when I inhaled this and took a drag with fruity pebbles this tastes like fruity pebbles there's a lot of flavors going on there I'm very fruity probably one of the most flavorful cartridges or pods that I've had Wow I know it's Rockstar cush is what this strain it's their version of Rockstar cush I've never got a fruity pebbles taste from Rockstar cush before but while I'm really enjoying this taste very fruity very yummy yeah first impressions on the taste very good nice and smooth very smooth packs air pod like I said just like a jewel pod it's gonna last a little while but we're gonna get back to that because of course as always I'm gonna be smoking this over the next couple days gonna come back and finish up the review gonna let you know my final thoughts and let you know what to think about the soleil unplug pax air pop alright so after vaping this pack Sarah Soleil unplugged pod the last couple of weeks got some thoughts for you um I really like this pod the flavor is still there mmm it's a fruity pay the fruity pebbles flavor I really love it very fruity very flavorful I love it the flavor is lasted throughout the whole pod as you can see I've been vaping a lot of this here it's getting down to the nitty gritty they're not too heck of a lot left as it looks but looks can be deceiving with these packs air pods a little bit goes a long way in there as you can see it's not a very big pot to begin with but it does last quite a while I've been ripping on this quite a bit almost like a jewel going a little overboard that's one thing I'll be careful with these things so you know standard use it's gonna last you quite a long time never got plugged up once always nice and clear always a good vapor never harsh like I said unfortunately the apps not working in Canada packs get your act together get this app working in Canada so there's no settings for it I did find a similar pod an American pod I've got it vaping at about five hundred and six degrees those curious out there with the temple eyes and you know it produced a really good flavor really good vapor for the Sun lay on plug like I said the flavor last the throat the effects you get off it it's a little bit mild it's it's really it's happiness it's happiness strain you feel really good you feel happy you feel mellow just feel relaxed like you're floating along like I said there's days when I really ripped on this a lot and get a little foggy great you know it's not really energetic go get a lot of important things done kind of strain but you're gonna be coast and throughout the day and just feeling really happy real conversational real mellow I really like the buzz you get off this it's not super strong like I say you have like three four drags it's kind of a mild effect overall but you do notice it and you just feel really good you can't help but keep smiling I like this thing a lot great job so lay on the taste great job sway on the effects great job on everything except the packaging that packaging was ridiculous get better packaging packs fix your app get it working for the Canadian market because it's a really cool app and I'd really love to use it so it all of us here so get it working for us the price is good we'd love to see it be cheaper it's 45 bucks approximately for one of these pods really like to see the price come down but I really like to see all the prices come down so that's Universal but for what you're gonna get 45 bucks it's comparable to about a 5-10 thread cartridge there's also point five grams lasts about the same amount of time and I got to tell you packs air pods in my experience a pretty potent really good stuff so my review is overwhelmingly glowing I'd say thumbs up find yourself with a pax era device definitely seek out these pods you will not be disappointed thanks for watching hope you all found it informative if you've tried this before you agree with me if think I'm right think I'm wrong whatever the hell is on your mind leave me a comment I like to read them all I replied every one of them while you're here click Subscribe I do videos all the time I like to make new friends so click Subscribe you'll be the first one to see when there's a new one you know what brothers and sisters I hope you're all staying safe out there taking care yourselves taking care of each other until next time keep smoking", "89-GMuwaIyw": "yes this is josh from grants academy and we're back again for part two of how to read a food label in part one we discussed organic labels and what they mean and also price lookup codes in this episode we'll discuss percent daily values food claims and also product dates i hope you enjoy the percent daily values are normally located on the right side of a food label and are represented by a number followed by a percentage sign the percent daily value is a reference amount of a nutrient to consume or not to exceed each day it's how much a nutrient in a serving of the food contributes to a total daily diet so if we look at the food label at the saturated fat column we see that eating four cookies would satisfy thirty percent of our saturated fat needs if we go down to vitamin c we'll see that eating four cookies will satisfy eight percent of our vitamin c needs for the day the percent daily values are based on a 2000 calorie diet so if you're eating few fewer calories your daily value will be lower and vice versa for higher amount of calories make sure when comparing food products you always check the serving sizes so if you look at this label the serving size for one serving size will be four cookies so you eat four cookies you would be consuming 220 calories if you only ate two cookies then that would be 110 calories and that would only give you 15 percent of your saturated fat needs or four percent of your vitamin c needs a food with low nutrient content are basically unhealthy foods junk foods has five percent daily value or less of a nutrient per serving so if we look at this label we see vitamin a is zero percent calcium is two percent vitamin c is zero percent iron is six percent so this is an example of a food with low nutrient content [Music] so a food with a moderate or good amount of nutrients has a daily value between 6 and 19 percent so if you look at this food label this is a moderate source of vitamin a and vitamin c foods with high nutrient content have 20 daily value or more of a specific nutrient so if we look at the same food label it's although it's a moderate source for vitamin a and c is a rich source for calcium and iron the sell by sticker our stamp is how long the manufacturer suggests that a store should sell foods like meat poultry eggs or milk so basically how long these foods should stay on the shelf the used by stamp is how long foods will be at peak quality foods may be still or less tasty after this date this is the one most of us are familiar with especially with milk you know it has the date that it goes rotten usually you can drink it a day or two after but for most foods the use by date is the last day you want to have them without you want to consume them before that use by day the best if used by stamp is how long food has the best flavor or highest nutrient quality so foods that haven't been consumed by that date may not taste as good they may get a smell like rotten milk or the nutrient quality might it might be lower nutrient quality than if you ate it before fat free means the foods have less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving but this doesn't mean the food is healthy normally when companies remove fat from a product they have to add sugar so that it would taste good so when you see a low fat claim always check the sugar content low fat means that it has 3 grams of fat or less per serving and again just like fat free check the sugar content to make sure it's not loaded with sugar [Music] reduced fat means it has at least 25 percent less fat than regular versions of those foods foods with low sodium have 140 milligrams or less per serving and fruits with very low sodium have 35 milligrams or less per serving it doesn't mean these foods are healthy if they take the salt out they have to add more fat for texture or more sugar for taste so if you see low sodium or very low sodium always check the fat and sugar content foods that are low cholesterol have 20 milligrams or less of cholesterol and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving no added sugar means there was no sugar or sweeteners added to the food but it can still contain natural sugars like those found in fruit or dairy normally when they take sugar out of a food they increase the fat for texture and taste yes that wraps up part two of how to read a food label hopefully after watching this you're able to use the percent daily value to either calculate how many nutrients or lack of nutrients are in a certain food product or count the calories if you're one who does that i also hope this makes you a more affordable shopper so now you know how these companies use these various claims to get your money so i hope you enjoyed thanks for watching if you haven't already go check out part one and don't forget to like or

"aoIZ8Ol8Vis": "i love me a good whey protein isolate you know i if you follow us on instagram you probably know about my obsession with farm fed s'mores uh since our business partnership with axe and sludge i've had the unique opportunity to be able to try out all of their farm feds and today we're going to talk about farm fed in terms of what you can expect from it what kind of way isolate it is and where it fits into this industry so strap in and let's get talking about farm fed whey protein isolate from access sludge nutrition welcome to price plow proteins can be a very boring topic completely honest uh there's not a lot to it so that's why i don't talk a lot about them i usually much prefer to talk about pre-workouts intra workouts stuff that has a large sum and fast panel i can break down all the ingredients now today this is a product that has one main active ingredient with an extra additive into it and a fun flavor side to it as well so i'm not gonna do any flavor testing today i've tried all these today already it wouldn't be a candid answer for you guys of you know what i think right off the bat if you do follow me on instagram you probably know that i freaking love this s'mores um the cinnamon apple pie uh this one oh it's like it's just ridiculous i am a huge fan of farm fed i think that it fits really well into the industry um and it has a very unique spot for what it is and who can utilize it so let's talk a little bit about what's in farm fed and i'll get to my thoughts on it as a whole at the end so farm fed is a pretty pure whey protein isolate let's see if we can focus in on this supplement fast man got a bright light on i'm sorry this is going to get blown out a little bit first ingredient here is whey protein isolate obviously it's grass fed now let's be really real about this focus on my face um whey protein isolate is very low in fat so this one's going to have half a gram of fat and that fat is actually probably coming mostly 99 from the medium chain triglycerides so what does grass-fed change about the nutrition in the cow well it really changes the fat content it increases the omega-3 content in fat so there's not a lot of fat in whey protein isolate does not make a significant change in terms of nutrition but i am a huge animal lover i much prefer to know that my food and my nutrition is coming from happy cows and that's why i usually try to support grass-fed protein does it make a difference in body composition digestion all that stuff probably not probably doesn't make much of a difference but it does make me feel better knowing that my nutrition comes from happy animals that matters to me personally it might matter to you that's why i always bring this up because people will say grass-fed protein is no different than any other protein and while if you're looking at it completely from the for you know the standpoint of nutrition omega-3s macros you're right it is the same exact thing probably but it's coming from a much happier animal and that matters to me moving on to the next couple ingredients out of all of the different ones here it's mostly going to be the same ingredients unless you're looking at the s'mores the s'mores has inclusions in it meaning there are tiny little marshmallows in it which i love the experience of i can't stop eating it it does add a little bit more fat a little bit more carbohydrate but it's not that much i'm not going to talk about that one all that much i don't really want to talk about all the ingredients in there just know they took some creative liberties with that one and if you're i mean if you're taking that it's it's for flavor right you're getting a couple extra macronutrients in there for the vast majority of them you're gonna have three grams of carbohydrates and half a gram of protein of half a gram of fat alongside the normal 22 grams of protein outside of the protein where are these other macronutrients coming well there's mcts and they also utilize dextrose in the flavor system so normally whey protein isolate would have almost no carbohydrates but you're seeing here they have three grams of sugar that's dextrose coming in there for the flavor that's why this tastes so good now a lot of you will turn around say ben that's not very pure they're adding sugars you're absolutely right you're 100 right they're adding an additive into here for no other purpose other than to make sure that it is flavored well but i'm going to stand out here and say for the vast majority of people this extra amount of sugar is not gonna make a difference it's gonna make the experience much more enjoyable and three grams of sugar is easily worked off with a good training session and if you're one of these guys that takes uh accent sludge you are one of the hardest workers in the room there's no reason you can't out train three grams of sugar on the other hand as well there's a whole enzyme blend here that's digested plus which is almost protease as well as lactase lipase hemi sub which is hemicellulose cellulase infraredace diastasis and they also add propane at the end which also helps with digestion so there are a ton of different things in here to not only make sure that the protein is digesting very well but also carbohydrates in here as well so the three grams of sugar is going to be utilized very well because this is probably being taken post-workout after you've trained it's also being digested very well it's not going to upset your stomach and it's being utilized to help you recover one of the interesting stories that we learned from uh pat and ryan on the supplement industry roundtable a couple months back was that um a lot of these products were formulated directly for seth things that he needed i mean he's the face of the brand right um he is one of the owners but he's also the face and the spa you know the main athlete and um one of the things that he always said was that protein did not digest for him very well he always ended up in the bathroom uh and as a pro bodybuilder was very in tune with his body that was important for him to know that it will be able to digest well so patrick the you know in-house formulations and manufacturing expert over there uh added in the digester uh and all the other blends of digestive enzymes and supposedly i i believe him because that seems to be a man of his word this product digests extremely well so i am not a person that has a problem with digestion very often every here and there i run into problems but as a whole i digest protein very well but this one of course also digests very well it's not no different from the norm for me but if you have a problem with whey protein and i instead of going towards plant proteins which are less effective for as a whole most of the time uh until new data comes out are less effective for building muscle i would recommend you check this one out and give it at least an honest try with the digestive enzymes if you want to go for something that tastes really freaking good the farm-fed s'mores is my absolute favorite but the cinnamon apple protein is really good the cookies and cream as well i mean all of these are amazing i'm i'm going to destroy all of these in probably about two months to be completely honest with you i drink an exorbitant amount of protein when i'm trying to grow and this is one of my favorite ones to try out so quick video i mean there's really like two real active ingredients in here the protein as well as the digestive enzymes but i wanted to go quickly through and explain to you guys what is in this protein uh and lastly to talk a little bit about where it fits in the industry i know a lot of people complain when i talk about proteins that have added sugars or added fats um are not the most pure thing and believe me i get it hailing from my alma mater at nutrabio i put a lot of value into purity obviously those guys use absolutely no fillers absolutely no excipients absolutely none of that stuff but as i've grown i've come to understand the industry is much larger than consumers who demand just that some people can't stomach protein with no fillers some people need some extra digestive enzymes some people need some extra sugar for it to taste good and honestly three grams of sugar is not all that bad for someone who's training hard and well so i think that this product fits into a great category of people who might suffer from issues of eating uh dairy and can't really stomach all that well but also don't want a horrible tasting protein blend that is what so pure that it can't even be you know i don't want to say digestible um it can't even be palatable for a normal person so this product really helps bridge the gap between people that just want to enjoy their product and people who really need help with the dairy so i'm you know competitive power lifter i don't have a weight class to fit down into i'm i'm in the 275 weight class and i walk around 265 to 270 so i have room for extra macronutrients so i don't mind using this daily uh two scoops with my rice krispies post-workout uh some other people might say that the three grams of carbs per scoop is too much for them and you know what more power to you if that's how closely you track your macronutrients you don't have room for six grams of carbohydrates for 50 grams of protein well i don't really understand what you're doing with your diet but you know good for you so in any case i love the product i can't wait to smash through all of these bottles if you have any questions about it you could always go over to pricebottom.com axe and sledge otherwise you could comment below i'd love to talk about the products with you this is one of my favorite proteins out there the s'mores is my favorite s'mores protein the cinnamon apple pie is my favorite apple pie protein as a good red blooded american i love some apple pie and s'mores and i think that we all should more often so guys thank you so much for watching the video i know this is a shorter one not a lot of active ingredients in here but farm fat is easily one of my favorite whey protein isolates with some extra added benefits so thanks so much for watching and have a great day [Music] welcome to price plow [Music] [Music]", "ylSNcvX2dNM": "so you're trading football on betfair you see a goal fly in markets go suspended and the prices start to reset and adjust to the goal going in almost instantly but just how does this work who determines the prices is it really the punters and traders today you're gonna find out this will be an extremely revealing insight into how the in play football prices actually work so go grab a nice cold beer or a scotch on the rocks and let's get into it so i want to keep this explanation as simple as possible and as brief as possible without going too deeply into it but the theory is that the betting exchange is just a pure exchange with supply and demand dictating the prices so if i want to offer up a bet at a certain price and someone else wants to take it then those bets will be matched and we are on our way and the betting exchange takes its commission and that was the way it was sold to us 20 years ago that we're just betting against other punters and that was the way for a long long time however the reality is that today the robots control the prices what then it's actually been this way for a long time i think since around 2007 it was around the time when betfair did release access to their api that the robots started to get involved as people built their own robots and just got a whole lot more sophisticated and just one piece of evidence to show you that the robots are in control if you ever watch the markets on a big level say premier league match when a goal goes in the markets go suspended and when they unsuspend you will see that they zero in on the on the new prices almost instantaneously give or take a few ticks here and there if that was humans if it really was humans in in the markets then you you would see those prices bouncing around all over the place 20 ticks here 10 ticks there but the robots they know what they're doing okay they don't have the same emotions as us and they know exactly what prices to go for straight away compare that with a lower level uh match of low liquidity and watch how the market prices move after a suspension that's when you probably see a lot more humans involved in the market but like i said it's been this way for a long long time so for most watching this video it's always been this way so don't you don't need to be scared of the robots and robots are not necessarily a bad thing either as i'm gonna be explaining later on in this video perhaps the question we should be asking is who owns the robots and should we be creating robots for ourselves and so the way it works is that the in-play prices will follow a model and the model that they follow is going to be dictated by the starting prices of that match okay so once those starting prices are determined at kickoff once the match actually kicks off then the model is set and the prices pretty much will be on rails from that point on that's the kind of term i use to describe it when i try and describe it to other people it's almost like they are on rails it's like a train has left the station and it knows its destination and it knows the times that it's going to be at every station from there on in and they will the prices will follow that rail all the way to the final whistle and this means that the employee prices are actually already determined from the starting prices and they can be fairly easy to predict from that point on which is how the the football trading simulator works okay and that's probably a bit of a insane realization for a lot of people who do believe that the exchange is just almost like a pure exchange like we spoke about earlier on with supply and demand and all that sort of thing however do keep in mind the prices can go off the rails due to short-term fluctuations okay and that is why when you look at a betfair chart it's never a straight line here or there you're going to see the prices bouncing around here and there okay so short-term fluctuation can be caused by something such as a period of dominance by one team if a team is really really dominating especially in that first 20 minutes probably see them steam and that causes the prices to go off the rails if they don't score those prices end up back where they should be back on the rails at some point probably by half time but just similarly if you watch the markets closely when a team gets a dangerous free kick or a corner you will see that the fluctuations will happen as loads of money flies in for that team if they don't score well loads of money starts to leave the market maybe going on the other team who are on the counter attack and you just see these fluctuations here and there okay but these are just short-term fluctuations because eventually the prices will go back on to the rails and end up where they should be okay now prices can fall totally off the rails but it usually has to be due to much bigger factors okay so the short term fluctuations of a corner a free kick or a period of dominance that's to be expected in a football match so they won't those factors there won't cause the markets to completely flip-flop and the prices to fall off the rails but the prices can totally change in certain situations in certain scenarios okay now usually it's down to poor liquidity and one aspect of poor liquidity means there's probably less robots involved in the market okay but poor liquidity can be an aspect i mean if you've ever tried to trade a under 23 match or something similar then the prices can be a lot more unpredictable and that is due to just there being less robots in the market okay but also unexpected match performance especially in cup matches now if you have a cup match where one team has rested a whole bunch of their players like we see liverpool have done down the years remember liverpool wolves last year they rested their whole team liverpool were favorites at kickoff 20 minutes in the market flip-flopped and wolves were were the favorites and then went on to win comfortably and that is what you would determine as being an unexpected match performance because wolves were by far the better team then that can cause the the prices to completely fall off the rails okay but that's a pretty rare event okay uh also injury to key players that can completely uh flip the markets i've seen that happen i mean if barcelona were to lose messi to an injury during the match the prices would adjust severely i remember the champions league final 2018 salah got injured by ramos and if you watch that market closely i remember the markets uh completely flipped in favor of real madrid i can't remember the specific prices but it was almost like the markets knew what was to come because i think that happened when the match was still nil nil so things like that an injury to a key player but again it's a rare event and red cards as well again similar rare event but uh red cards uh do not seem to have well the markets don't seem to have good models for red cards at least not at the moment okay but anyway i thought best to kind of illustrate this and actually show you how this all works so what we're going to do is we're going to use the football trading simulator alongside a live premier league match to show us where the prices should be at certain points and what also affects the market in the short term and you can also get a good idea of how accurate the football trading simulator software can be so we're going to dive into some real life examples of this but before we do that i would really love it if you could hit the like button to support the channel if you like this sort of content you want to see more of it it only takes a quick press of the like button to show your support and help the channel to keep going press the like button then grab another cold beer and let's get into it so i'm going to give you an idea of how this works so we're in the football trading simulator here and the football training simulator will simulate a pretty much a perfect market as in the liquidity is great there's nothing going wrong there and the match is kind of going according to how the markets expect it to go it's not going to take any of those short-term fluctuations into account so what we do is we plug in those starting prices this is just about to kick off crystal palace against west brom crystal palace there at uh 2.5 and then we put in west brom's price we don't even have to put in the draw price okay it should just automatically calculate it and then under two and a half goals is pretty low at 1.58 and then from the under two and a half goals price we can get all the other gold prices as well as you can see on the left so that's our market right there okay and that is the model that the in play prices are going to follow and they're going to follow it on rails okay so uh 20 minutes in this is where the price is kind of should be if it's still nil nil draws into 2.88 similarly with the one and a half goals and two and a half goals there at 1.36 and all that sort of thing so that's kind of where you expect the prices to be and then we can move that forward to say half time and you can see that the jaw probably should be into 2.34 and the two and a half goals should be into 1.13 under one and a half 1.55 and the nil nil pretty low there at 3.35 okay and this could all be predicted before the match okay one big misunderstanding is that a lot of people feel like well if if if the action is is really slow or really fast then that's what dictates the second half prices okay now it can to an extent however generally you're gonna find the prices will remain on the rails okay generally now of course like we mentioned the short-term fluctuations could put these prices out by a few ticks for short periods of the match depending on what is happening but largely it's going to revert back to the model okay so let's let this match go in play and i'll follow along with it and show you exactly what i mean so just had a goal to crystal palace and as you can see the prices are settling in and i think that goal was pretty much the 37th minute okay so what we're gonna do we type it in here go 37 minutes and then uh let's move the clock forward to 38 minutes when all the odds should have settled and crystal palace should be around 1.51 okay so let's see uh looks like the the odds are starting to move uh move towards it there you go moving up to 1.51 and it's going to settle there and uh west brom should be around 9.2 in the draw at 4.3 remember the price the the the price on the favorite is usually going to be the one uh to really look for but yeah the draw the draw has moved out as to where we would expect and that crystal palace price is going to bounce around at uh 1.51 and uh yeah there you go okay so uh crystal palace one west brom nil just wanted to show you how we can uh see where um where the prices go after the goal um and there you have it and you kind of saw as well i mean when when the markets first reform they look they dipped a little bit below that price of 1.51 but this is the fluctuation that just happens in the meantime as you get people taking bets just wanting to get out of the market they don't really care what price they're taking and they can kind of take the wrong prices okay but um yeah just just a just a quick example and then obviously from here we can move it forward and just get an idea of where that price would be at say half time and crystal palace should be into probably 1.47 by the time this uh market settles at half time okay you can get a good idea of how to operate from there okay so just wanted to point that out uh let's move on and check out something else oh and sorry i was also meant to show you the goal markets as well so under one and a half goals 4.1 over into 4.3 and uh you can see that's pretty bang on there uh with for this match 4.1 or 1.33 under two and a half goals should be 1.71 and 2.4 and let's check this out here yep that's pretty much it 1.69 and uh 2.44 and uh well actually i mean it is in the 39th minute now so uh let's move it forward and then i'll probably start to adjust yet 1.69 2.44 so you can see it is is pretty much in line with with the market okay um something sometimes it can uh go off the rails uh when it is still nil nil but then uh usually it will eventually revert to where it should be okay according to the model so anyone wanted to point out crystal palace won west brom nil 39 minutes now on the clock so we're 53 minutes on the clock crystal palace's price here is 1.51 they haven't really uh moved in the second half you might be thinking well what's going on there because simulators saying they should be in to 1.42 and west brom should be drifting and so should the draw but this is uh what can happen in play matches this is a period of sustained west brom pressure and it's just causing crystal palace's price to remain static very very common um in in football trading and just shows what can happen with the short term fluctuations and things like this are an opportunity okay especially when crystal palace are under this sort of pressure you know the price isn't moving against you in the meantime and then you can get involved with uh with laying them okay but we know that uh once this pressure if it doesn't produce a goal for west brom then you're going to see crystal palace's price revert back to the the revert to the mean revert to whether it should be pretty sharpish okay and that can also kind of create an opportunity because you know that once crystal palace maybe get hold of the ball their price should then start to steam in you could probably gain a good 10 ticks pretty quickly okay but this just shows what can happen in the meantime especially when the action on the pitch uh is uh well as it is now with west brom uh putting a fair bit of pressure on crystal palace so 67 minutes on the clock and that west brom pressure didn't pay off and you can see that the odds are back on the rails again okay crystal palace into 1.34 according to the simulator that's where we think they should be at 67 minutes on the clock 1.34 west brom 22 the draw at 4.8 and so you can see it is starting to revert back to where the model should be okay when that west brom pressure didn't pay off okay so yeah just just more more of a a an example of how the rails work okay they are on the rails you get that sustained pressure like you can see here which really caused that price to go static for a while but the west brom gold never materialized and now that steam has developed to really put the prices where they should be for this time of the match and now we're back on track okay i'll update you if anything more of note happens in this one so we're into 85 minutes and price is staying largely on the rails crystal palace 1.15 on here they're into like 1.12 on the markets um mainly because they look like they've really got this under control okay lots this is when people really start to jump in and start to kind of buy money however what you can kind of see as well in these situations when you do get a team kind of one nil up late on and if they just suddenly decide to defend and just impart the bus for the final five minutes then you can definitely see some interesting fluctuations on these prices here uh which definitely you probably wouldn't see in the simulator model because that's when it really starts to get desperate for some punters anyway um under one and a half goals should well it's not not great liquidity 1.24 to back 1.27 to lay and uh on here currently should be around 1.28 but we've actually just lost a whole minute when i was recording this just looking at the screen the betfair clock is a little bit behind but yeah you can see 1.25 should be the price on under one and a half goals for this and that's pretty much in line with where it is and and as you saw that just dropped into 1.21 um and again look and then it's gone back to 1.24 these are the fluctuations you will really start to see uh late on in these in play matches as uh the rails start to come off the robots uh start to get overpowered by the emotional punters okay lots of people may be trying to jump in for late goals and uh all that sort of thing especially in a one goal uh football match because obviously one goal to west brom completely changes all of this okay all these people backing the low prices and even as i'm saying this you can see the fluctuations in in front of your very eyes now as it starts to get pretty nervous for a lot of people okay so um yeah i mean this could be an interesting video for those who haven't really studied the actual in play markets it's definitely worth doing um sounds like there's a goal somewhere else in another match i'm trading but anyway yeah so this is just something to be aware of really really is worth studying the markets and you can start to see what can happen late on in these matches and this is going to start to get nervous now uh with uh it being a one goal gap you're going to see a lot of fluctuations if there's a dangerous free kick or a corner you can start to see this actually drift on the under one and a half goals market and uh similarly for palace and they'll probably stick around being 1.1 for a short while if west brom can put on some sort of pressure so uh yeah you got you've got a pretty decent lesson there on how the in play rails and robots uh work the markets and the things that can affect them in the short term and so one kind of trick just to make sure the match actually gets on the correct rail when it is kind of low liquidity this one below 100k matched just wait until it actually kicks off then take the kind of starting prices in like the second minute so marseille 2.02 and then breast there at 4.3 uh let's try and put those in and then you're you're probably much more likely to to really latch on to the correct starting prices and you could just move it forward to say to say the second minute and put in the prices which uh which are there at that moment so 1.87 on under two and a half goals and then it should latch onto the rail and then be accurate uh heading forwards okay so anyway we're in this one low liquidity example would be interesting to see how this one develops so we had a goal in this marseille match on the stroke of half time which is really convenient as it makes recording this video a little bit easier so marseilles price has gone into 1.37 so we established that this is a low liquidity match and this these are the sorts of matches where when they are low liquidity the prices are much more likely to go off the rails and you know is the simulator still going to uh be able to match up to these even lower liquidity matches okay 200k matched by halftime is is not the most liquidity so uh marseille we're into 1.37 brest out to 15 and then the draw went out to 4.8 but there's a bit of a gap so that's pretty much 4.9 so let's head over and input that goal that marseille goal which was on the 45th minute and uh you can see that marseilles price has gone into 1.35 according to the simulator and as we know they're currently at 1.37 that's pretty accurate there uh breast 15.5 it's pretty accurate there they're at 15 and then the draw it should be 4.9 because of the liquidity and 5.1 so two ticks out on the draw so it is fairly accurate even uh even in the low liquidity matches um let's check out the gold market let's just have a look at the under two and a half goals market this one's probably going to deviate a little bit so we're expelled so the market says 1.67 but that's really 1.68 and the simulator says it should be around 1.72 so out by a few ticks but still within our expected plus or minus 10 margin or margin of error let's have a look at the over one and a half goals prices should be 1.3 on the simulator uh the markets 1.31 so what one tick out on that one so just wanted to show you how it can it can still work pretty good on the lower liquidity matches these matches will go off the rails a lot easier but it's still fairly accurate okay you gotta just have a little bit of patience in the lower liquidity matches so i hope you found that useful checking out the in play football markets you will definitely be surprised how many people

"UAclnKm7ZFQ": "When you were young, you have at least once caught some ants in the forest at the park right? Then you might have dropped the ants you have caught. But, everyone, aren't you curious? It's almost like falling down from the 2nd Lotte tower, compared to human why could ants survive without any damage? Ants that we meet in our daily lives have various sizes from approximately 3mm to 1cm. These have very small mass, about 0.5g, which is less than 1g. If you compare ants falling down the stairs to human situation, what will it be? If we suppose ant's body to 5mm, the height of the stair is about 12cm so If we transfer into human who is 170cm tall and weighs 60kg, which is 24 times of that ant and transfer the stairs to about 41m height we can think of the situation as jumping down from the 15th floor of the tall building. If we suppose acceleration of gravity as 9.8m/s\u00b2, far away from 41m and calculate the velocity of the person, it is v=\u221a2gH it becomes the enormously fast velocity; 28.3m/s. At the moment he drops to the ground, the velocity becomes 0 and the impulse he gets is the same as the momentum right before he drops to the ground. That is, if you multiply 28.3m/s to 60kg about 1698kgm/s size of an impulse is applied to the body. This amount of impulse is the same impulse as the 11 pound, about 5kg bowling ball flies to us at the speed of 1222km and hits to our body If there are no miracles, this amount of impulse will lead you to be killed on the spot. Now let's take a look at the case of ants. The height of one stair is 12cm, the weight of an ant is 0.5g. The velocity of an ant right before he drops to the ground which is 12cm far away is about 1.5m/s As soon as he drops to the ground, as expected, the velocity of an ant becomes 0 then the momentum the ant had before he dropped to the ground is transferred to impulse and it is applied to the ant. If you calculate it, it is about 1.5x0.5x10-3[kgm/s] So he gets about 7.5x10-4[kgm/s] impulse. If you compare to the impulse the human gets, it differs by 22,600,000 times. But surprisingly, ant can lift more than 5,000 times heavier weight than his body he has amazingly efficient body structure that can distribute the weight Thanks to this collaboration of his body capacity and the tiny size of impulse, not only the ant can survive when he fell from the stairs but also he can survive even when he fell from the higher place and he can crawl as usual, safe and sound. Actually there are reasons why the ants can survive after falling down from the high places other than this I mentioned previously. First, when the ant falls, through air resistance the speed of the ant can be somewhat controlled.  As I mentioned shortly, the number of the legs of the ants plays a role in distributing the power. Thanks to this compound  factors, ants can survive from falling down the 2nd Lotte tower. Isn't that amazing?

Please flatten it to about 3-4mm so that it is not too thin * Making choux dough * Put unsalted butter, sugar, water and milk in a saucepan and heat Simmer until the butter is almost melted Sift in the flour and mix well Put it on low heat and stir When the color of the dough has changed evenly and a thin film forms on the bottom of the pot, take it off the heat You should cook it well (about 1 ~ 2 minutes) Transfer it to the bowl and allow to cool slightly Lightly beat the eggs to loosen them, then mix them into the dough in 3 parts When you drop the dough from a spatula, you should get a long triangular trail like this Put the muffin liner in the muffin mold and pipe in the choux dough If you don't use the muffin liner, the choux \nwill not form nicely Cut out circles of the cookie dough and place on top of the choux Bake for 25 minutes in the oven at 190\u00b0Cd * Making diplomat cream * Mix the cooled down custard into cream that has been lightly whipped If you put the custard through a sieve, you can make the cream smoother and get rid of lumps Mix by hand to complete the cream Add the chopped strawberries and mix Cut the strawberries into small pieces and use a kitchen towel to lightly dry them Don't press too hard when drying the strawberries or they will be crushed Cut a small hole in the top of baked cookie choux Remove some of the choux inside to hollow it out I filled it halfway with cream and put a whole strawberry inside Fill it to the top with cream I finished the top with a strawberry cut in half Strawberry cookie choux is finished ^^ The flavour of the chopped strawberries in the cream and the whole strawberry is so refreshing I think it'll be even more delicious if it's chilled in the fridge I'm happy with the cupcake-like strawberry cookie choux~~ ^^ Thank you for watching ^^", "EB9071BV1PU": "it is amazing it's just delicious that's definitely my favorite good morning guys so today is gonna be an interesting day i'm gonna do a quick food tour i'm gonna start with a breakfast i've just finished my training i normally like to train fasted so the first thing i do after i finish training is get a good amount of protein what i have here is three egg whites with some veggies i have tomato peppers and what else have i got here oh and i have got some fat reduced cheese so it's quite high in protein and very low on fat so that is gonna be my breakfast it's gonna be very light the reason for is as we're gonna go out and around and as you know in greek or maybe you don't know they have so many bakeries so it's kind of a sin if you go to a just normal supermarket and get a pre-packed food so what i would suggest if you're in greece just go around and you're gonna find delicious and fresh baked stuff the plan for today is as i mentioned earlier is to go around and show you what so far are the places that i really like and for lunch i have something special for you i'm gonna take you to a place that i have been going quite few times now and i just and i just love the food there okay well let's start to the breakfast what i'm going to actually do now i have the protein all the protein here which is about probably 20 25 grams of protein including the cheese that i told you that i've put in here what i'm gonna do i'm gonna add an orange which will help me to absorb all that protein as i told you there are bakeries at every corner and they have so many delicious treats as you can see they have a they have a huge variety of things here they have all sorts of cakes they have flies here baklava and these well these ones are a bit too sweet for me i'm definitely not going to go for those hello and these are these sweet syracuse that they're chocolate white chocolate and just normal chocolate covered so these ones are these that sweet bread is covered with dark chocolate and just normal chocolate white chocolate they have these these these ones are apparently typical for grease they're greek specials so they make the phyllo pastry and they fill them up with that white syrup what i chose to get is almonds cookies so here it is so this is basically almonds that they've managed to put them in a bowl using some almond paste so yeah it's quite nice it's not very sweet and it's very almondy so that's gonna be the first thing that i'm gonna get today after my breakfast and now we're gonna head over to another place okay they still have noodle bars and burgers but greece is not that famous with noodles at least to me neither with burgers that is the place that we're gonna get our next treat and i definitely love the quality of these products here this time instead of the just a cookie i think we're gonna go for an ice cream someone already ate half of the ice cream we took so now it's my turn that is such a good combination it's a cheesecake ice cream with with brandy crackers i'm gonna make a quick stop over here we're gonna get a freddo espresso they have other stuff as well some freshly prepared food ice cream very hot one so we're gonna skip the ice cream cookies and other stuff it's just mouth watering here all sorts of breads and that's where everything is being baked thank you i'm not going to be going over the all the health benefits of eating seafood as that is gonna be topic of another video or you can just check it online but what i'm gonna just tell you is that the health benefits are quite few so i try to get good quality fish whenever it's possible and that place that i'm visiting at the moment is one of those places that i can say that they have a good quality fresh fish and they also cook here the fish so yeah and actually i think that they can even deliver it for you so if you're around that area here in greece in tesla nikki you can definitely check them out and get some fish now enough talking let's head in and see what we're gonna get okay here we go guys have a look at that variety [Music] here is the main guy hello hey hello hello last time i had like a lean fish so this time i wanted to take something that is a little bit more faster okay [Music] [Music] i would recommend this it's glasses okay try it i would recommend it for babies because it's the most lean fish that there is in the sea okay if you want something lit for grill i would recommend this one the one with the bigger this is good for grilling yeah it's very good for really this this looks tempting i've never had that i'm not sure how it's called in english but in greek is muy okay so let's see what we're gonna get today um i really got attracted by this one with the big guys okay so how many of them is the one going to be enough it seems like a no good size it's the size ideal for one person for you okay so we're gonna have it grilled the last time i came here i had the i think it was like lemon or mustard potatoes they were delicious so i'm not sure what we're gonna get this time but we'll get to see after 15 to 20 minutes so the fish is here now here we have some grilled vegetables so that is a massive portion of grilled vegetables and here is the fish guys so that is how the fish looks like and these are the potatoes these are the mustard potatoes that i was telling you about earlier so they yeah they are mustard potatoes yeah mustard potatoes and this is the fish thank you very much i hope that we're gonna see again maybe after a day or two yeah right so we're back in the house and we're gonna get to try the fish that we just picked up was still warm the potatoes and the grilled vegetables of course i'm gonna just take a bite from those potatoes that i had a couple of days ago and i think that they are just delicious yeah fantastic now let's have a bite from the fish so tender all right so let's move that away peel the skin guys fish you need to have it with fingers take these ones out it's really good this this fish it has i'm gonna check it out in english what the name of this fish is but it has a really nice texture it tastes like a steak and just delicious probably that's gonna be my favorite fish now i haven't tried it that's my first time trying it and yes it is just delicious i don't know if i've mentioned in a previous video but i totally love seafood apart from only one that that one time when i got poisoned by uh what did i have i had some shrimps and i got food poisoning oh another thing let's add some

"Qs3VMdpx4Uk": "[Music] hi i'm nancy clark sports nutritionist i went into sports nutrition because i love nutrition i love sports i've always been active hiking biking cross-country skiing and i wanted to know more about how nutrition and exercise combined so that i could have more energy and also help other people that had the same questions what's changed in sports nutrition is that more and more athletes are becoming plant-based be it vegetarian vegan or flexitarian and that means that they just need more nutrition education so that they're getting the protein they need the calcium they need all the nutrients that they need to get the most out of their workouts what a plant-based diet means to me is a foundation of grains fruits and vegetables and then you plug in the protein of the day maybe you plug in greek yogurt maybe you plug in peanut butter maybe you plug in chicken maybe you plug in salmon so the foundation is always grains fruits and vegetables with a protein added in what hasn't changed is that athletes like all people need protein to build and repair their muscles grains to fuel their muscles fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals and calcium-rich foods for their muscles to contract in their bones to stay strong the most common dairy based myth that i need to debunk is that plant-based beverages such as almond milk or oat milk are nutrient-dense and better for you than dairy milk is and the truth is almond juice or these nut milks are actually very poor in protein and the calcium that's added to them is not a natural form of calcium and they just lack the nutrients that you get in a glass of life-sustaining dairy milk after a workout a sports drink offers carbohydrates to refuel the muscles but chocolate milk offers carbohydrate to refuel the muscles plus protein to build and repair the muscles so my vote is for chocolate milk breakfast is the most important meal of the day and i'm sure you've heard that for years the reason is is that when people eat breakfast they put fuel in their body have a car you put gas in it it goes you have a body you put breakfast in it it goes a lot better when people skip breakfast they generally eat the food later at night in the form of cookies chips chocolate so they're trading in cereal milk and fruit for foods with less nutrient density that's not the right way to go my favorite breakfast is a variety of cereals with milk fruit and nuts so i get all four of the food groups it's quick and easy i don't have to cook it and i love it to get adequate protein at breakfast a lot of people think they need to cook eggs the truth is all you need to do is pour milk on cereal have cottage cheese with fruit have a greek yogurt with granola so it's very easy to get adequate protein with protein rich dairy foods my favorite dairy food is actually milk i love milk on my cereal in the morning i put milk in my tea i'll have a glass of milk with my beloved peanut butter sandwich it's just so satiating and it stays with me i feel fit i'm passionate about nutrition because it matters food is very effective in terms of improving health and preventing disease and i found that so many people are confused so i'm passionate about being able to help them figure out how to manage the american food supply and eat well for their future well-being", "s70vPRku3H4":

some Grain-Free Pumpkin Tarts! And, as a BONUS and to say thank you, \nI will be sharing 2 additional recipes. One for some cookies and one for some\nbars. Both include the same combinations of ingredients plus a few extra. So keep\nwatching and I'll show you how to make all 3. For the filling, you do need to\npre-soak some seeds in this case I've prepared a combo of half sunflower seeds\nand half pumpkin seeds they are both organic and raw and certified gluten-free. We're going to start by making the base of the tart. It's pretty simple as it only has a few ingredients and while it's baking then we can make the\nfilling for the tarts. For the base, we're going to be using tiger nut flour. We're going to be milling or grounding up some sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds into flour that \nwe're going to incorporate into the rest. Coconut sugar, some softened\ncoconut oil, flaxseed meal which is over here. We're going to be adding some water and some \nsea salt and that's pretty much it. Tiger nut flour tends to be sometimes a little\nbit clumpy. I would recommend just sifting it. In this case, it's exactly\nthree-quarters of a cup so I'm just going to sift it just because I do not want\nlittle chunks of tiger nut flour in the base of the crust. I mean when you're making a tart if you have a little bit extra of certain\ningredient like that make too too too much of a difference but it's best to\ntry to keep the exact measurements. I'm going to show you how to mill the seeds.\nThe recipe calls for 3/4 of a cup of the ground either pumpkin or sunflower seeds\nor both a combo of both so what you want is approximately half a cup of seeds to\nyield about 3/4 of a cup of the seed flour. If you have extra flour once your seeds\n are milled, it's okay don't worry because we can use it in the \nother recipes as well. The main recipe is the tart itself but\nwe're kind of going to be making the base part three times in order to make\nthe cookies later on and also the bars. So you're going to need triple the\namount if you want to make all three recipes. The reason that I'm doing BONUS\nrecipes is when you do the tart filling depending on if you do 4 larger tarts\nor many small tarts or even 1 larger tart you might not use all the filling.\nSo in the bar recipe, for example, I add a quarter of a cup of the leftover filling\nfor that recipe. If you don't have any filling the left don't worry because you\ncan actually use a quarter of a cup of just the pumpkin pur\u00e9e. This is, like I\nsaid, 1/2 a cup of seeds in total and then we're gonna mill it and to ground\nthem up into a fine flour and then we're gonna add it to this here. So, I'm\nbasically using a small blender, high speed blender, just to mill the seeds and it\nworks really really well. If you don't have a small blender you can use a\nlarger Vitamix (dry container) or you can also use a spice or coffee grinder as\nlong as it's clean of course and it works equally well. So a few seconds is all you need. I will measure because I need 3/4 of a cup. There should not be clumps but\nif you wanted to sift it you could so I'm just eyeballing it but I'm going\nwith three quarters of a cup because that's what the recipe calls for.\nAnd then we're gonna be adding a quarter cup of coconut sugar I had initially\ntested and developed this recipe with half a cup but I like to always try to\nreduce the sugar contents of any recipe I make I think it's better for everybody\nto reduce our sugar intake in general so instead of 1/2 of a cup, 1/4 cup is\nsufficient and if our whatever reason you don't have coconut sugar, maple sugar\nworks really really well. It's like the powdered version of it. You could use\nmaple syrup you could use cane sugar or raw sugar if you have it. You can also\nuse if you have fresh dates you can soak them in water and create kind of\nlike a a soft paste that you could just incorporate into the crust or you could\nuse a food processor or blender to blend your dates to make them smooth to use\nthem as kind of like a glue to the tart base. Anyhow so this was 1/4 of a\ncup of the coconut sugar that's all we need and then we're gonna be adding 1/4\nof a cup of coconut oil that can be melted or it can just be softened. Mine is\nreally really soft so I'm just going to add it as is. I will measure it just so it's more\naccurate for you guys at home and this is how quickly and how easy\nit is to measure 1/4 of a cup. The recipe, this is for like I said, for 4\nlarger tarts but if you want to make more and just make them smaller\nthat is completely fine too. I've made it into a larger tart using a\nspringform pan and that was fine I worked great as I kind of like not\nonly did I do a base but I kind of put some of the tart crust up on the outer\nedges too a little bit. And then filled, I used all the filling for that version.\nWhen I made tarts I almost prefer to make the smaller ones just because one\ntart cut in half can feed two easily because one tart is pretty big and\npretty filling. And then if you are not familiar with tart tins you can find\nthese ones that have that happen removable bottom which are kind of handy\nwhen you can just like pop it out but you can also find some that are just like\na whole little tart base without the bottom without it having a removable\nbottom and I cut little pieces of unbleached parchment paper today and\nthen we're just going to put a little bit of coconut oil so it doesn't stick. \nBut by adding the paper it'll just be easier to remove but either\none works equally well. If you wanted to if you don't have tart pans or tins you\ncould just use a muffin pan and line it with some unbleached parchment cups.\nLet's get back to the crust, we've added so far, the tiger nut flour, we've added\nthe sunflower seed flour, the sugar, the oil, and now we have to add some flax so\nwe're going to add and I need my little measuring spoon...\nI'm just going to use the same one that I was using for the oil but so we're\njust going with 1/4 cup of flaxseed meal and then we are going to add some water.\nAgain, we're adding 1/4 cup of water this is just to help bind all the ingredients together. To the short list of ingredients we're also going to add \na little bit of salt. I actually have half a teaspoon in the base recipe so 1/2 a\nteaspoon of sea salt but if you just wanted to put 1/4 it would be fine. I think\nthat is it. Again, it's always good when you're making a recipe for the first\ntime just to go over the ingredients a couple of times to make sure you're not\nforgetting anything. Then we're gonna just mix everything up and make sure\nthat everything is well blended. Like it might look dry but once you keep mixing\nthe ingredients everything is going to come together really really well. You don't want too wet or else it's not\ngonna be a good crust right. So just moist enough to make everything stick together. Alright, that's pretty good!\nI've gone ahead and oiled/greased three of the tart tins and I'm just gonna go\nahead and do the last one here I'm just gonna use my fingers\u2014it's not gross!\nI'll show you so I often put a little bit just at the bottom so the parchment\npaper will stick and then just don't be afraid to go right in there with your\nfingers because the oil will prevent from the tart to stick to the edges. So it\ndoesn't have to be perfect it just has to be there. You can rub the rest of the\noil on your hands because it is a good moisturiser! And then I\njust lined a cookie sheet just in case I don't know something was to spill but\nit shouldn't. Go ahead and divide the mixture into four. It doesn't have to be\nperfect this recipe is pretty, I'm not gonna lie...brown! Everything seems to be\nthe same tones of brown. So I don't know if you have any tips on what we do to\nadd color to this dessert, let me know in the comments. I would love to get your\nopinion. It is a wonderful dessert if you are a person that obviously can't eat gluten, can't eat nuts, can't eat eggs or dairy. It is a reduced sugar treat so it's not sweet\nbut just naturally sweetened enough to make it feel like you're eating a really\nsinful dessert but it's way better for you like you could eat this for dessert\n...for breakfast if you want it too! I'm just going to use my hands to fill the\ntart and it's okay if you push some of the filling onto the edges. So then you get that little rippled rippled effect on the\nedges and then you just want the base itself to be equal like I mean even not\nequal but even. If you want I will put some examples of these tart tins in the\nin the description so you can just click on the link and see what I have or I'll\ntry to find something as similar that's close to what I have. All right so you\njust want to spread it out I don't want to take too much of your time.\nEveryone's busy busy busy busy which is why recipes like this are good\nbecause they don't take too much time so if you're having people over you know\nfor like a Thanksgiving meal or a special gathering if you make little\nversions of this it would be really good. So I'm just gonna do a little switch here And, I'm sure you could probably make a\nfew more tarts if you divided the mixture amongst maybe six tarts but you\nknow what, it's nice to have a good size tart and base crust and the filling you\ndon't want it to be too thin either because then it might fall apart. \nI've already turned on my oven it's preheating at 350 degrees. Not too hot, we\ndon't want to burn them but we want to pre-bake them before we put the filling.\nFor the base, we are going to bake it for 15 minutes and then while they're baking I will start by showing you how to make the filling, \nthe pumpkin filling. So let's put this in the oven! I'm going to go ahead and strain\n and rinse out the seeds. And while I let them drip a little bit\nI will get my blender ready to prepare the filling for the tarts.\nSo for the filling itself I do admit that you will need a pretty like a heavy\nduty blender or you're going to need a food processor. I have not tested this\nrecipe with a food processor because I don't have one. So I'm using my\nVitamix and then I use the tool that comes with, the tamper I believe it's\ncalled, to help blend all the ingredients. So this process can take a few minutes\nto make sure everything is well blended So let's go ahead and add the ingredients\nthat we are going to be using in the filling. For the filling, we have the\nseeds that I just rinsed out we're going to add them in a bit. I'm using pumpkin\npur\u00e9e, in this case, I'm using organic canned pumpkin but you can most\ndefinitely cook your own pumpkin if you want you can use squash you can use\nsweet potatoes but if you do cook your own pumpkin you can reserve some of the\nwater from the cooking. The tart base requires a quarter of a cup of\nwater, you could have just used the leftover water from cooking, the cooked\npumpkin. With that being said, we're gonna add one cup of pumpkin pur\u00e9e.\nI'm going to make a mess here but I will just go ahead and measure it out and I know\nthis is a dry ingredients measuring cup but it doesn't really matter, not for\nsomething like this. This brand... what is it called... \nFarmers' Market it smells very good. And it smells like good cooked and pur\u00e9ed pumpkin. Luckily my dad has a sugar shack so we, \nmy family, makes our own maple syrup so I have a generous\nstock, if you want to call it that of maple syrup. So I'm very lucky!!! \nIn this recipe, we're adding half a cup. I'm going to measure out... if I can find a cup\nhere, half a cup. Again I'm just roughly measuring these ingredients and yes I am\nusing a dry ingredient cup but it doesn't completely matter, not for\nthis. So this is half a cup of maple syrup. Of yummy organic, naturally sweetened by \nnature maple syrup, thanks dad! Two tablespoons of... We're adding arrowroot starch to thicken\nthe mixture. I've actually tested this recipe by cooking the filling first but\nit's not necessary. It does create kind of a richer texture or maybe more\nsweetened because it's kind of like reduced. But it's not necessary. You can make yummy tarts just by mixing all the ingredients, adding them to the tart base and then we're going to return\nthem to the oven for 40 minutes. So that was arrowroot starch and we're\ngoing to add some cinnamon and some nutmeg. For the cinnamon we can add a quarter\nteaspoon and nutmeg seems to me to be more of a stronger taste so we're just\nputting half, one eighth of a teaspoon of the nutmeg. If you like more, if you like less,\nthen adjust it accordingly to your liking but that's how much I make, \nI mean how much I use in this one. That's pretty much it so we're gonna now take\nthe seeds, and the seeds will be wet because obviously they were soaking right \nbut that's okay because that will add moisture. You want to reserve 2 tablespoons \nof the soaked seeds and then you're going to take 1 tablespoon of\nthe 1/2 cup of maple syrup and you're going to just mix it up and this will be\nfor the top of the tarts. And to this little mixture, you can\nactually, add a little bit of, just like a little tiny pinch of salt. This will be like the decoration for the tarts. This is basically our pie filling. This is a grain-free recipe, yes it's\ngluten-free, egg-free, dairy-free but it is very nutritious so you get all the\nbenefits from all the seed,s the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, the spices and what else did we put... \nand some maple syrup, so yes, it's a pie, it's a tart, it needs to be\na little bit sweet but it's divided, you know amongst for larger tarts, \nso it's not too sweet, in the end. Let's go ahead and pur\u00e9e the mixture. I have to admit, I'm not a pumpkin pie lover\nsorry but I do like this tart because it has the added seeds and the maple syrup\nand the tart base itself is very interesting so all in all everything all\ncombined together it's a great treat! So as soon as the pie bases are\nready, or the tart bases, then you will you don't actually have to let them cool but\nthen we can add some of the filling. I'm going bring them here, they're a little\nbit hot but that's okay! So earlier I was mentioning that these\ntarts are pretty brown. The base is brown, the filling's brown and then the\nseeds are pretty beige and brown and green so again if you have any ideas or\nsuggestions on how you could add some color to this lets me know something it\nwould be nice to have something bright and orange but unless you like I was\ngoing to say you can't zest a pumpkin but because the color of the orange\ncolor would probably turn brown when baking anyways but anyways if you have\nany ideas let me know in the comments because I'm sure we would all like to learn\nsome tricks. We have the filling and it is nice and smooth. Actually, I made\nthese yesterday, or the day before, and it wasn't as smooth and this one, actually\nmore yellow and yellow-orange. I guess it depends on if you cook your pumpkin if\nit was if you do decide to use sweet potato or if you use a squash. I guess\nthe shade of the yellow can vary. You can as much as you want or \nas little as you want. It depends on how you like your tarts,\nbut the bar recipe that I'm going to be making requires a quarter cup of this\nmixture. So then we're going to reserve this to make the bars. So for the\ntarts I actually have a lot of the filling leftover but... and if you do\nthat's okay because you can also use this mixture to make the cookies as well.\nSo maybe we'll do that maybe I won't overflow the tarts too much. And again if\nyou have any tricks on how to make the filling less poopy and more pretty\nlet me know. Heck, I like baked goods and I like more nutritious versions of baked\ngoods but I'm definitely not an expert baker. I'm good at modifying\nrecipes but I'm just your average baker that is very passionate about\nusing better for you ingredients. Alright, that looks good! I might use the rest of this for the cookies anyways. And then that's kind of pretty much it! Other than adding the\nseed mixture that has a little bit of maple syrup, and a little bit of salt, you\ncan put them however you want. You can spread them out on one side,\non the edge, or whatever. You could put some right in the middle, it can go wherever you want. It just adds a little bit\n of a 'je ne sais quoi'. Again it's is pretty brown and natural looking but\nonce you taste it it doesn't matter what it looks like, it's really good! Here we go, our little tarts! \nOur grain-free tarts, grain-free filling and then we're gonna\nput this in the oven for 40 minutes. And I'm going to set the timer so I don't forget. I just wanted to show you that if you do use a tart pan that has no\nremovable bottom but if you lined it with an unbleached parchment sheet\nlet me see there it should come out fairly easily and then you could just\neither remove and or tell your guests to remove the little thin sheet underneath.\nSo, I wonder if I should take a bite I can't wait! Where's my fork? For the pie (tart) you can enjoy it when it's still warm that's not a problem. It does have the consistency of a pumpkin pie it's\ndefinitely not bright orange it is more of a yellowish color to the texture but\nconsidering what we put in the ingredients it makes sense that I would\nbe this color right but it's uh look I want to I want to see if the crust has a\nbit of a crisp to it because that's kind of how I like it so if it's fresh you\nhave the perfect texture to the crust a little bit crispy and the filling is\nperfect and then with the addition of the few seeds on top then you have a\nlittle bit of crunch and a little bit of sweetness and saltiness \nand texture from the seeds. So this is really good!!!", "QH_CpVYl9Ak": "[Music] hello everyone and thank you for coming or if you're coming back today i am very excited to show you how to make apple cider donuts it is now late fall or maybe even early winter at least in the temperatures it is getting ready to snow here so i really like making something like this with these lovely fall and winter flavors like apple cider these donuts are super tasty and they've got all those nice warm flavors that just make you super super excited for winter so all the ingredients and the measurements are listed down below and we can start baking so we are going to start with a large bowl into which we are going to add our flour brown sugar baking powder baking soda salt and our spices now here i have cinnamon ginger and a little bit of clove i'm gonna leave the cloves out of the recipe because i think they were just a little too overpowering i added the tiniest little pinch but it was still too much and it just sort of tilted my mixture from tasting like apple cider to tasting like gingerbread so i'm gonna say go ahead and leave that out okay just to let you know but we're gonna go ahead and whisk those all together and then we're going to set them aside and we're going to move on to our apple cider now i am using some lovely local apple cider here you do want to make sure that you get something that is nice and dark and full of flavor because that's really going to help out our donuts but to help out even more we are going to reduce it so that we concentrate those flavors so you're gonna go ahead and pour that into a pot and you're going to boil it until it is about a third of the original volume so just go ahead put it on to simmer and leave it to simmer away until it looks like it's about a third of the original amount of liquid then we're gonna let it cool before we move on now once our cider is cooled we can go ahead and mix together our liquids which is our two eggs that you're just going to go ahead and give a quick little beat before adding your butter and your apple cider now we are going to go ahead and add all of our wet ingredients straight into our dry ingredients and we are going to give it a mix so i started out by using a spatula but you can use a spoon or your hands right from the get-go and you're just going to mix it until it is stiff enough that you need to switch over to your hands anyways then i went ahead and kneaded this sort of really gently in the bowl for a little bit before turning it out and bringing it all together now these are cake doughnuts not yeast donuts because we use baking powder as our raising agent so we do not need these to rise at all we're going ahead and cut them out right away into our donut shapes now i just went ahead and used a nice big circle cutter as well as the end of a piping tip to get my donut shape but if you have a donut cutter then all the better go ahead and use that and you're just going to cut out your desired donut size once you have your donuts all cut out you can go ahead and transfer them to a parchment-lined baking sheet so that they are all ready when we go to fry them now for frying you have two options the first is to take a nice heavy bottomed saucepan sauce pop the first option is to take a nice heavy bottomed pot and you're going ahead and fill that about three quarters full with some vegetable oil and then you're going to heat that to 350 degrees using a candy thermometer or an oil thermometer and you're going to bring it up to temperature and then you're going to use that to fry your donuts the other option is to set up your deep fryers so once we are all ready to fry we're going to make sure our oil is ready we're going to make sure we have our donuts all ready we're gonna make sure we have somewhere to drain our donuts i like to just have a little wire cooling rack that i sort of let them drip dry on and the last thing we're going to do is make sure that we have our cinnamon sugar ready so for this i didn't even measure but what you're going to do is just mix together some sugar and some cinnamon and you're just going to have it at the ready beside the fryer that we can roll our donuts in once they come out of the oil because we want to roll them while they're still nice and warm so that the cinnamon sugar mixture will stick to the donuts so working with two or three donuts at a time you're gonna go ahead and drop them in your fryer now because these are cake donuts and not yeasted donuts they do not have a lot of air in them so they will not float right away do not be worried when they sink to the bottom of your fryer they should float back up to the top in just a few seconds all you're going to do is cook them on each side for 60 to 90 seconds you're looking for a really nice deep brown color so you're going to cook them on one side flip them over continue cooking and then you can pull them out onto a wire rack to drain after they've drained and cooled on their rack for about a minute until you're able to touch them with your hands without burning yourself you're gonna go ahead and pick them up and toss them in your cinnamon sugar mixture to coat then just go ahead and repeat this with all your donuts and you are done these donuts are so quick and so easy because they are cake doughnuts so they don't need any rising times like yeasted doughnuts do as well they are so beautiful with that nice cinnamon sugar and the deep brown color so i hope you make these i hope you enjoy and i will see you next time", "N-Y6WzrbVpc": "hello

but I was wrong I was being fooled like most people are today so in today's video I'm going to teach you how to read a food label so that you know what to look for so that you can be empowered to make healthy food choices hi I'm Ali a Christian health and fitness coach and I want to welcome you to cross training women where I teach and train women how to be physically and spiritually healthy so that they can live fully and abundantly the life that Jesus came to give us when I was first learning about nutrition and transitioning to a Whole Foods plant-based diet I came across a plant-based registered dietitian and nutritionist Jeff Novak's video teaching you how to decode a nutritional label and be able to decide if food is truly healthy or not and it's from his set of rules and guidelines that radically changed the way I grocery shop and select or reject certain food products because the truth is grocery stories are filled with products containing extremely deceiving health claims because food manufacturers and know consumers do not know how to actually read a food label they take advantage of this a scientifically and carefully choose the latest health buzzwords of diet trends and they stick that on top of their food packages in order to make you think that their product is actually healthier than it is but the claims that they boast about on the front of their packages in order to kind of influence your purchase decision and boost their sales are misleading Jeff Novick has three rules that I want to go over with you today and the first rule is never ever believe anything you read on front of a food package so I was rummaging through my sister's cabinet and I found these organic bunny Teddy Grahams and on the front it says certified organic and then it also has a little Abell down here that says made with goodness no artificial flavors synthetic colors or synthetic preservatives no high fructose corn syrup so clearly this product is healthy right I mean it's organic and it doesn't have any of these things it's made with goodness so what's the first rule never believe anything that you read on the front of the food package and you'll see why when we turn it over and bill over rule number two so Jeff's Novak's rule number two is to look at the Nutrition Facts specifically you want to look at the calories from fat the amount of sodium and sugar in the product here's why when you look at the amount of fat in it product it's listed in grams and when you look at this product for instance it says four point five grams of total fat and then when you look to the right-hand side it says there's a bold number that says six percent both the things seemed relatively low and not like not a big deal but in order to actually find out what percentage of this product is from fat you have to take the grams times nine because since there are nine calories and a gram of fat so for instance in this product you take four point five times nine which is forty point five and then you would take that number divided by the number of calories to get the percentage of fat so when we do that it actually comes out to thirty one point one percent of fat so that's a lot higher then you are led to believe right process oils are the biggest contributor to the amount of fat in a product and while oils seem innocent or even healthful these days process oils even olive oil are one hundred percent fat calories and they have been shown to be harmful to the endothelium which is the innermost lining of your artery and injuring neck lining is the gateway to vascular disease so you want to limit or avoid added oils as much as possible the guideline that Jeff uses for the percentage of fact that I also follow is 20 percent or less so if the product contains less than 20% of fat it's good to go so this does not pass the test so the next thing you want to look at is the amount of sodium in a product salt is another ingredient that food manufactures love to pack into their product because it not only helps their product taste better without adding calories but salt is also a powerful stimulant that triggers overeating because it messes with your brain and satiety mechanisms and so you actually end up eating more of their product which is exactly what they want besides salt contributing to overeating which leads to obesity and other diseases of dietary excess it's important to limit the amount of sodium you consume because salt can also increase your blood pressure which is a risk factor for strokes heart attacks and even kidney disease Americans on average eat thirty-nine hundred milligrams of salt per day but the dietary guideline recommendation is for less than 2,300 milligrams which is about a teaspoon a day so we are getting way too much salt in our diet another reason why you might want to limit salt intake is because salt enables people to hold on to excess fluid and so it can result in bloating or swelling or even make you look a little puffier because real Whole Foods contain natural amounts of sodium you don't need to go out of your way to add salt to your diet in fact it's better to probably buy products that are low in sodium or even no salt added and then if you want to add a little bit of salt for flavor you can do that yourself at home and then that way you have control over it and so the rule of thumb that Jack uses for sodium is to have the amount of milligrams of sodium be equal to or less than the amount of calories in the product and so for this product there is 90 milligrams of sodium and 130 calories so this product would actually pass on the amount of sodium since the ratio is less than one to one lastly you'll probably want to take a look at the amount of sugar in the product because in addition to oils and its salt sugar is the other predominant greedy ins that food manufacturers love to use because anomaly makes their food taste better but it also is addicting but added sugars are just empty calories meaning that there is no nutritional value and so you're just adding extra calories to your diet something that you don't need because food manufactures know you're aware of this now they're trying to just kind of hide it or disguise the amount of sugar that's actually in their products by using different names some of them which sound healthier like organic brown rice syrup or even names that you're not familiar with and don't even know that it's added sugar and so it's not uncommon to have three or four different sugars in one product and without you even being aware of it so just rule of thumb for sugar is to make sure that the added sugars are no more than 5% of the calories and so you're gonna have to do a little bit more math again because it's listed in grams and so you're gonna have to take the amount of grams times four since there are four calories in a gram of sugar or a carbohydrate so for this product there are seven grams of added sugars and so you're gonna have to multiply that by four which is 28 and when you define 28 by 130 the amount of calories in the product it comes out to about 20% of calories from sugar so this does not pass the test Jeff's third and final rule is to read the food ingredients and honestly this is the only thing that I really look for and care about in a food product when I'm choosing what is healthy or not the best food products contain real whole food ingredients only what's a real whole food a real whole food is a food that resembles how it appears in nature there is no food labels they themselves are the ingredients there's nothing added or taken away for example take an apple apples don't have food labels apples is the ingredient where you could take something like a whole grain like brown rice brown rice is the only ingredient in the package so that's a real whole food and you want to look for products that contain as much or only real Whole Foods as possible that's what you'll find out is that food products that are the best often contain a very short list of food ingredients whereas the processed foods contain a long list many of which you don't even know how to pronounce because they're often added food chemicals or food preservatives that manufacturers use in order to increase the shelf life or add some sort of texture or flavor or taste all of which is just to increase their profits they're not looking out for your health so another thing to note is when you're reading the ingredients is that order matters the ingredients are listed in order of predominance with the ingredients use in the greater amounts first followed in ascending order by smaller amounts so this is like especially important when it comes to things like added sugar or oils or salt if it's listed high in the ingredient list that means that there's a lot of that in often sugar is listed as the second ingredient and so that tends to mean that there is a lot of added extra sugar so that's when you really want to pay attention and go back to the amount of added sugars that are listening the product to know how much is coming from that added sugar it's something like a natural sugar like raisins then it's not going to matter as much because sugar and raisins is natural and it's different than just the added table sugars so let's take a look at how these organic Annies Tiger Young's food ingredient holds up so the first ingredient we have listed is organic wheat flour and while it doesn't sound bad organic wheat flour is not the same as organic whole wheat flour so organic wheat flour is more processed which means more nutrients are taken away so it's not really a great source of grains the second ingredient is organic cane sugar so we have sugar listed second which means that there's a lot of sugar in this product the third ingredient is oil and so oil again because it's listed third means that there's probably a lot of oil and probably why this food has the amount of calories from fat that does and then finally the fourth ingredient is the organic whole wheat flour so this is again the better source of a grain something that's going to add fiber to your diet but since it's listed fourth and there's probably not a great source which means there's probably not a lot of fiber which we look here and it's less than one gram which is not a great source let me go on and you can see that there's organic in vert cane syrup organic corn flour organic chocolate cookie bits and as we continue to go down the list there's more food chemicals preservatives and added sugar like organic honey so after evaluating the whole package and the reading the ingredients and the nutrition facts we can see that this product isn't actually made with much goodness at all so again that's why it's so important to know how to read a food label so that you can make the best choices if you found this video helpful and you feel more empowered to make healthier food choices when you're grocery shopping please give this video a thumbs up and also feel free to comment below I'd love to hear from you", "g1oER9V5qkA": "hey guys welcome back to my channel welcome back to my lowest calorie kitchen where we create and review amazing anabolic recipes that taste awesome and keep you from going batshit crazy on too many calories today we have a special video because we won't be making just one recipe we'll be making five recipes because we'll be reviewing ethan's anabolic puffs hey bro what who's eaten what i mean who's ethan ethan the original pop maker the puff baker ethan harold man go check out his youtube channel and stop interrupting me so five recipes five anabolic puffs we'll be ranking each one to see which one is the best the puff panel begins now without further ado let's go [Music] so as you can see behind me we have a huge list of ingredients for these recipes so i'll be pre-measuring everything out because otherwise the huge part of this video will be just me measuring out a file of ingredients and that won't be so much fun so i've been around the kitchen long enough to know that if we're not altering key ingredients if we change a few a few grams of the ingredients here and there will not make or break our recipe so i've created a common base for four of the puffs except the s'mores one and that measured out everything here except for the bread and either man i know you're watching every time there's bread involved i know that anxiety is starting to build up and you know what i mean what piece spot pieces low pot pieces butt piece butt piece puff piece button pieces spot piece butt pieces pot piece the butt piece butt pieces butt piece butt pieces you are only using butt pieces butt pieces bro the lowest calorie bread i can find is 50 calories or slice and not only is it crossless but there is no butt piece and which are this one bro no butt pieces here so for this initial base for the first four puffs we'll be adding eight slices of bread next we'll be adding 35 grams of vanilla whey protein 200 grams of egg whites 16 grams of all-purpose flour [Music] 10 grams of coconut flour and 10 grams of our preferred signal [Music] this is our base we'll be using for the first four puffs except for the s'mores and after this base is complete we'll be splitting it into four individual parts and we'll be adding the needed ingredients for each particular recipe but the base is common and i forgot to add the example gum and baking powder we have 3 grams of xanthan gum and 3 grams of baking powder it was right in front of me [Music] of course we need to stop and scrape the blender hey bro sup what was that diet you said you were on oh is the one where you'll be scraping the ninja blender every other day for the rest of your life oh thanks man don't mention it man this would be a good time to preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit for 180 degrees celsius one more minute and we're done and that's done [Music] that's what it looks like doesn't even move exactly as it should be now i'll be splitting these into four equal parts okay so i scraped this as best as i could i've got four equal parts equal size parts i got around 100 grams each and look at the sticky mess this leaves in our blender god it's gonna be really hard to clean what is it wanna see how i clean my blender check it out [Music] what i have here is just a bit of warm water and some dish though work that in your in a bit so you get some water and dish soap in there now all we need to do blend on high let that soak for a few minutes and then washing it will be much much easier okay back to our recipe so for the banana puff we need to mash up some banana we couldn't do it in the ninja blender so we'll be using our mushroom blender check it out mashed banana done then we're gonna need some pumpkin spice in my country you cannot find pumpkin spice because pumpkin pie is not so popular here but a bit of research and we find out that pumpkin pie spice is made out of cinnamon nutmeg ginger and allspice and we have those there you go homemade pumpkin pie spice we'll be adding just a bit of the pumpkin pumpkin pumpkin pie spice because this thing is really important next we'll be adding a bit of almost banana just get rid of this real quick there we go see there are no rules in the anabolic kitchen no i said you have to do all of these in the blender you can use whatever kitchen tool is available to you if you only have an immersion blender use that if you only have a food processor use that one and for the banana droplet puffs we'll also be needing a bit of cinnamon like 0.5 grams i'm just eyeballing it that should be enough [Music] now give it a really good mix and done our banana crullay base is done next for our cinnamon puff we only need to add one gram of cinnamon cinnamon done for the blueberry puff base we'll be needing some blueberry syrup i know this is forest fruit but trust me all i can taste in this is blueberries we'll be adding 5 grams blueberry puff base done last but not least or lemon buff but this will be needing three grams of lemon pudding and a bit of true lemon the one i can find here not too much because this thing is very powerful i'll add about one gram lemon puff base done so we have completed the base for the first four puffs now it's time to make the smallest one we're gonna be needing a small food processor now i've added one gram of salt and gum and 1 gram of baking powder i'll be adding 2 slices of bread 50 grams of egg whites 10 grams of chocolate whey powder 7 grams of chocolate pancake mix i don't have the kodia cake mix but my protein should do just fine [Music] a bit of sweetener about 2 grams of cocoa powder 5 grams of chocolate syrup i have a chocolate caramel one and last but not least a barbecue sauce that is really smoky i'll be adding just one gram let's do it and our small space is a so now that we have the base ready for all of the five puffs it's time to take a large baking tray and give it a nice coating and let's begin making the actual puffs [Music] the lemon one the banana cinnamon pop and last but not least does more the banana and the cinnamon puffs get the cinnamon treatment for the blueberry pops we're gonna be using some frozen blueberries as well as a bit of swimmer on top the smalls get the marshmallows then those blueberries a bit of crushed up graham cracker and a few chocolate chips and now we'll be baking them 10 minutes on medium heat [Music] so i forgot to spray them with a bit of cooking spray i did that now after i put them in the oven while they're cooking we're gonna be making the toppings for the other three puffs that need the topping after they're cooked we'll be starting with the lemon glaze we'll be adding a bit of confectionery sugar a bit of our true lemon replacement and we need to be careful with the water we only want to be adding a bit at a time just so we get a glaze-like consistency and i think that's enough water we'll set that aside for our banana brulee we're gonna be mashing up a piece of banana with a little bit of water we'll be adding a bit of brown sugar and a bit of sweetener oh and a bit of cinnamon and that's our banana puff glaze set that aside and last but not least the cinnamon puff a bit of cream cheese microwaved for 30 seconds a drop of vanilla extract and a bit of sweetness now we just have to wait until the 10 minutes are up and our puffs are done and here we are finally they are done and look at that that is just amazing you cannot imagine the smell in here right now it's like early in the morning when you go into a bakery and everything is fresh out of the oven and all of the smells kind of blend together that's how it smells in here right now these are truly a side to behold so here we have it five recipes five puffs disclaimer i will be ranking these based on my taste alone this will be subjective you don't have to agree with me you don't have to disagree with me you can do whatever you like but this is my kitchen and i do whatever the hell i like whatever the hell i want there is a strong chance my ranking will not apply to you so what do you need to do you need to make these recipes and try this out for yourself these are awesome these and put a lot of hard work into these recipes and i can already tell this will be awesome each and every one of them i'm nervous guys i don't even know which one to start with let's start with the lemon glaze one that takes me back that tastes exactly like a lemon pastry i used to get as a kid and look how dense these are i won't be able to finish all of these they're really feeling real dense really packed that's awesome and i'm not even a big fan of lemon next the cinnamon wow i'm a huge fan of cinnamon taste the cinnamon really comes through tastes just like a cinnamon roll how quickly these are gonna fill you up crazy so that's a good cinnamon bun next let's go to the banana puff banana brule the banana glaze really comes through the banana on top is just the cherry on top of the cake man this will be hard how am i gonna rank these because they are all awesome damn let's go to the blueberry one if you like blueberries blueberry muffins then these are for you blueberry taste is so intense it's awesome last but not least the s'mores one i have really high expectations for this because it has chocolate it has graham crackers it has marshmallows it has really big boots to feel let's see i ate about half of this and i'm already full the s'mores the smoky taste really comes through the chocolate the marshmallows the cracker they all come together really nice why did i want to rank this that will be really really hard these are all awesome guys you should try out each and every one of them they are super amazing but since i wanted to rank them we have to do it number five the fifth best puff for me personally is the banana brulee it tastes good it tastes awesome but i believe the glaze takes over way too much from the actual puff itself so for me this is the fifth best puff it's still a great puff don't get me wrong all of these are awesome but we need to make a ranking so that's all we need to do fifth place banana the fourth place for me personally is the cinnamon i like it a bit better than the banana but i don't know maybe it's my fault i think it tastes a bit bitter maybe my cinnamon is too powerful but it is still awesome do try it out it's worth it number three for me the third best is the blueberry i would have preferred it if i put the blueberry syrup on top and that would have made it higher in my list try it out blueberry muffin puff is awesome number two i would never have thought a lemon puff would make it to such a high place in my list i'm not a huge fan of lemon and if you would have asked me without tasting any of these which one was the worst out of them all i would definitely have picked the lemon but in this case this puff is really amazing and that's saying something coming from someone who doesn't appreciate lemon and of course the number one there was no doubt about it is the one with the most calories but chocolate base chocolate chips graham cracker marshmallows if you're into it for the taste then that's the better tasting one if you're into it for the lower calories though the lemon takes the lead but since we're not ranking on calories and macros but on taste alone the s'mores puff is the winner for me so do try all of these out they are all awesome don't take my word for it i am subjective i am ranking this based on my taste and my opinion alone you should have your own opinion and make your own assessment based on your taste alone these are all awesome recipes that you definitely need to try i will link all of them in the description i will link all of their calories their macros links to all of their original videos by ethan so you can make these recipes and form your own opinion and which one is the better part for me the smalls and the lemon take the lead for you could be the cinnamon the banana the blueberry i

"4fKbfMD2qWk": "[Music] hi everyone this is cooking with kurt today my husband donald and i are going to show you how to make a classic italian dessert called tiramisu tiramisu means pick me up and it's made with savvy yardy cookies also called ladyfingers dipped in espresso then layered with a cream filling and dusted with cocoa powder this recipe was requested by a lot of you and we hope you like this video now you can use store-bought ladyfingers for this recipe but we're going to show you how to make them from scratch in case they're not available in the store so for the savoyardi or ladyfingers we're going to start by taking 5 of these eggs separate them into yolks and whites and let them come to room temperature preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit then take two large baking sheets these are 13 by 18 inches and line these baking sheets with parchment paper once the pieces of parchment paper have been fitted to the baking sheets use a sharpie and a ruler to mark four rows that are three inches tall so that each baking sheet will have 4 3 inch tall rows the rows should be at least 1 inch apart then flip the pieces of parchment paper over so the ink side is facing down then in a large mixing bowl add in the 5 egg yolks half a teaspoon of salt 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of orange zest beat this together with an electric beater for about three to five minutes until the mixture looks pale yellow and slight ribbons should fall from the beaters when lifted from the bowl then sift in 1 1 4 cups of cake flour but do not fold it in yet just set this aside next we're going to make a meringue with the egg whites take a large glass or stainless steel mixing bowl add in the five room temperature egg whites and half a teaspoon of cream of tartar beat this with an electric mixer on low speed for about one minute till the mixture looks frothy then increasing the speed to medium very slowly add in 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar be careful not to add it in too quickly as this may deflate the egg whites when all the sugar has been added increase the speed to high and continue beating till you see stiff glossy peaks like this then one third at a time add this meringue into the egg yolk flour mixture and carefully fold it in you want to fold it so they are just combined and be careful not to deflate the egg whites for this batter it's actually okay to under mix it a bit and you can stop even if you see a few streaks of unmixed white and yellow today we're actually just using a piping bag with no tip since the opening of this piping bag happens to be 3 4 inches in diameter which is what we need to pipe ladyfingers but you can also fit it with a metal tip that's 3 4 inches in diameter transfer all the batter into the pastry bag again being very careful not to deflate the egg whites then at a 45 degree angle use the prepared lines on the parchment paper as a guide to pipe the batter into three inch long cookies that are about 3 4 inches wide when you reach the end just lift the tip with a swift diagonal upward motion to cut it off pipe five to six cookies per row into the four rows on the baking sheet so that you have about 20 to 24 cookies per baking sheet do this for two baking sheets so you end up with a total of about 40 to 48 cookies it might be slightly more or less depending on how much batter was piped for each cookie extra cookies just for eating are always welcomed when you finish piping your ladyfingers dust them with about 1 4 cup of powdered sugar we're going to bake these in our preheated oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are just lightly golden yellow but not too brown they should feel dry to the touch but still soft and spongy when lightly pressed we wanted to emphasize that these cookies should not be too brown but just lightly golden yellow let them cool on the trays for about two to three minutes and then transfer them onto a cooling rack to prevent them from sticking to the parchment paper let them cool to room temperature actually we're going to let them sit uncovered at room temperature overnight so they can purposely dry out dryer cookies are needed for tiramisu so that they can absorb the moisture and flavor from the espresso and cream filling our ladyfingers are now a bit dried out and now we're ready to make the cream filling similar to when making the ladyfingers take three of these eggs and separate them into yolks and whites set them aside and let them come to room temperature at this point we're going to prepare the espresso mixture measure out 2 3 cup of boiling water and add in 2 teaspoons of instant espresso powder and 1 4 teaspoon of orange zest mix this in and let it cool to room temperature if you have an espresso machine by all means use it to prepare the 2 3 cup of espresso if you don't have espresso you can substitute it with the same amount of strong coffee next take a large mixing bowl and add in eight ounces of mascarpone cheese and two tablespoons of dark rum or brandy beat this together with an electric mixer until it's uniform and smooth then in a medium-sized heat-proof bowl like glass or stainless steel add in the three room temperature egg yolks and three tablespoons of sugar beat this with an electric mixer for about three minutes till the sugar has dissolved and the mixture looks pale yellow in color then place this bowl over a saucepan with gently simmering water over medium low heat in a double boiler setup be sure that the simmering water does not touch the bottom of the bowl with a whisk continue to vigorously beat the egg yolk sugar mixture together for another three minutes till the mixture has thickened when the mixture looks like this take the bowl off the heat immediately add this thickened egg yolk sugar mixture to the mascarpone and beat this together with an electric mixer until it is just fully combined set this mascarpone egg yolk mixture aside to rest in the fridge in a separate mixing bowl and a clean set of beaters add in 3 4 cup of cold heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract beat this with an electric mixer on low speed until the heavy cream thickens and you start to see firm peaks be careful not to over beat the heavy cream or it will curdle and separate it should look like this then one third at a time fold this whipped heavy cream into the mascarpone mixture until it is just combined once again set this aside in the fridge we're going to make a meringue mixture with the three egg whites so take a stainless steel or glass bowl add in the three room temperature egg whites and 1 4 teaspoon of cream of tartar beat this on low speed for about 1 minute until the egg whites are frothy increase the speed to medium and very slowly add in 3 tablespoons of sugar a little at a time and when all the sugar is added increase the speed to high and continue beating until you start to see stiff peaks like this then one third at a time add this meringue into the monster pone mixture and fold it in carefully not to deflate the egg whites rest this in the fridge till you're ready to use it now we're ready to assemble the tiramisu at this point the espresso or coffee mixture should have cooled down to room temperature add in one tablespoon of dark rum and mix it in transfer this mixture into a shallow bowl and set this aside take a square eight by eight inch dish like this alternatively you can also use a nine inch round cake pan and line it with two oversized pieces of plastic wrap one going from left to right and the other going up and down so they overlap and make a cross i'm using a clean dish towel to press into the plastic so that the plastic clings tightly to the bottom and the walls of the dish and minimizing the amount of air bubbles there should be plenty of plastic overhanging from all four sides of the dish which you'll fold over and press against the sides then spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture along the bottom of the dish making sure that it evenly touches all four walls and smooth it out into an even flat layer as much as possible then one at a time take a ladyfinger cookie and dip it into the espresso rum mixture shake off the excess liquid then place them round side down on top of the mascarpone layer so that they are right next to each other with no gaps the lady fingers are quite porous and will fall apart if they sit in the liquid too long so make sure that you're dipping them for no longer than two seconds or so continue doing this until the ladyfingers cover the mascarpone as much as possible which should take up about half of the cookies about 20 to 24 cookies depending on the size of your cookies you can break them into pieces before dipping as needed to fill any gaps so it's an even layer of cookies on top of the mascarpone ensuring that there are lady fingers throughout the layer will strengthen the structure of the tiramisu making it easier to slice and lift when serving next take a sieve and dust one tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder over the ladyfingers then spread the other half of the mascarpone cream layer over the ladyfingers and like before make sure it touches all four walls of the dish evenly and as much as possible smooth it out into a flat and even layer create another layer of cookies with the remaining savayarti dipping them into espresso placing them round side down and making sure there are no gaps this layer will be the base of the tiramisu when we flip the cake over the next day so try to make them as flat and evenly placed as possible seal the top air tight with another piece of plastic wrap if you happen to have extra unused sauvignon cookies now it's safe to eat them yay [Music] we're going to let the tiramisu rest in the fridge overnight for a minimum of 12 hours for all the layers to set and for all the flavors from the saviyardi espresso and mascarpone to meld together when you're ready to serve it remove the plastic wrap on top and make sure the overhanging plastic is peeled off to the sides and out of the way we're using a flat serving board that's larger than the 8 by 8 inch dish place it on top then holding on firmly quickly and confidently flip it over slowly and carefully lift off the 8 by 8 inch dish and carefully peel off the

special episode an episode that I've been talking about for weeks and it's finally here and it couldn't happen at a better time episode 20 the wicked cuts panel taste test first things first allow me to introduce myself if you don't already know me I'm your host the place to be the beef jerky guide jerky guy Bry Bry the jerky guy I'm Tori's Bryan G and I am gonna spend this part of the review actually looking at the packaging and reading off this information a quick little backstory actually reviewed this a couple weeks ago and it was kind of an extensive review just reading through it as I see it as what I've done in Prior episodes but in an effort to kind of clean up my phone storage was low on my phone I accidentally deleted that thing and I had it backed up somewhere and I didn't so I'm actually recording this piece which shouldn't be a problem usually like I said in Prior episodes I like to do one take especially as I'm eating the product can't really reira view do a retake something I've already eaten if I'm trying to do a partial review so this what I'm trying to do here is just look at the packaging and read that information because I'm not necessarily gonna be able to do that with other people here and right now as it stands I heard them back from anybody but it looks like it's happening tonight at a local restaurant bar establishment and probably a good time to do it to kind of offset the stinging from what happened earlier today with with our beloved mooing the Patriots losing what should have been a winnable game and suffering playoff implications as a result and I was actually at the mall after the game it ended in people noticing the t b12 hat that I got for Christmas had been making little wisecracks about the tv12 method and this game didn't work and they're right so but this is probably the perfect time to do this test especially taste the Carolina Reaper because our soul is probably so burnt that we won't feel the burning in our mouth from this rebirth but anyway so I'm going to go over the package the packaging of this product so it's a wicked cups so I got this I initially had Wichitas send me Carolina Reaper and the bacon jerky about a month ago little over a month ago actually mmm and what I'd done prior to that so when I got the information it was right around Black Friday and they had a 25% off Black Friday sale they charge you for shipping and I don't not a big fan of shipping as I've mentioned before but this 25% helped offset about 80% of the shipping cost so I decided to take you know to bite the bullet eat the shipping costs and buy a couple other products so we're gonna actually be testing for products at this and the order that we're gonna do it is a mix of what I purchased and what I received from wicked cuts so what we're gonna do first is we're gonna look at the orange teriyaki which I guess has gotten kind of the best reviews across the board from people who have tried it and then we'll go so I received so I bought the orange teriyaki the next Priya flavor of the four is the barbecue mesquite flavor which I also bought during the Black Friday sale so kind of wet in the palate not hitting us right away with the Reaper the first couple products so getting something little sweet and something a little spicy dad we get hit with the Carolina killer which is what I received from wicked cuts and then these after we suffer eating this assumingly then they will get the applewood smoked turkey so as I dropped some of the products so what I learned when I looked at this packaging before so they're both other than the applewood smoked bacon jerky all these packages are 2.75 ounces and they are three servings per bag here and two servings per bag in the applewood smoked bacon the messaging on the back is the same and it's a message from the owner former bodybuilder branch Warren and if you follow their Facebook page add wicked cuts you can kind of see his journey and it's a pretty cool journey and he actually has some very good merchandising I like the merchandising I'm trying to reach out to them to get one of their shirt because it's a kind of a standard black with red font and I'm a big fan of red and black work out where and it's just kind of a parallel general so let me read this message here for the orange teriyaki it's how it's no added msg so this is the message that you'll read on every package of a wicked cuts product and here is the message right here and I will read it off to you right now it's a really cool message so here we are we believe you deserve a better jerky jerky that is so artfully crafted that inspires it in an instinctual reaction of high-fives and fist bumps not polite head nods jerky that delivers a satisfaction so good that it can only be rivaled by tapping out a full-grown grizzly with your bare hands we are wicked cuts and that and this is why we do wickedly awesome jerky our wicked ly awesome jerky starts well before the meat is marinated for hours upon hours in a mouth-watering blend of seasonings that was passed down by our great ancestors who roamed the wild plains crafting the perfect jerky a little bit of a run on there I like that book it also starts well before the jerky gods bless us with hand-selected premium cuts from only the finest sources of meat it all starts with the idea that if we don't leave you begging for more than we aren't living up to our word and trust us our word is stronger than a pissed-off Longhorn more than a hundred and fifty years ago my forefathers came to Texas they were cattlemen and beef jerky was a staple of their existence century and a half later I'm still carrying on that tradition with time-honored recipes that I'd guarantee you would love so and funny enough wicked cuts being from the northeast New England region Boston specific with that term wicked you think it it's a Boston based product and that's what I initially thought when I first heard of them but that's not the case they are actually based out of South Lake Texas so the orange teriyaki as I mentioned three servings in the bag standard 1 ounce size is 50 calories with 10 calories from fat a gram of total fat with no saturated or trans fats 20 milligrams of cholesterol 170 milligrams of sodium with only 3 grams of carbs no dietary fiber 3 grams of sugar and 8 grams of protein the neski barbecue flavor no added nitrates or nitrites no added msg as well standard one ounce serving size 60 calories with 10 calories of fat a gram and a half a total fat with no saturated or trans fats 25 milligrams of cholesterol 85 milligrams of sodium with one gram of carb no dietary fiber one gram of sugar and nine grams of protein Carolina Killa you know one ounce package doesn't say anything here about the any particular messaging with Ossining extreme he needs 50 calories 10 grams 10 calories from fat man 1 gram total fat no saturated trans fats 20 milligrams of cholesterol 115 milligrams of sodium 3 grams of carbs no dietary fiber 3 grams sugar 9 greatest protein then buy some milk I'm gonna give that information out but I'll have a glass to look out for myself and it's actually two other guys I gonna be doing it so we have a three-person panel doing this review the uncured bacon jerky and craft their premium uncured bacon high-quality it's gluten free no added msg no added nitrates or nitrites 2 ounces in this package with the standard 1 ounce serving is 120 calories with 60 calories from fat 6 grams of total fat 2 grams saturated fat no trans fats 10 milligrams of cholesterol 550 milligrams of sodium with 9 grams of total carbs no dietary fiber 9 you're into sugar 6 grams protein so that's it for the nutritional content piece of this to the packaging the one thing they do send in every package that you get I actually did initially have done a separate review for this but I'm gonna lump it all into this one they send you another one of their products called sin fit just a protein cookie and - one cookie in the package so this is almost kind of like a meal replacement bar so it's a chocolate chip cookie it's covered with chocolate icing and chocolate chips soft baked gluten trans fat free no hydrogenated hi drogyn aidid oils it's from a company probably one of their sister companies called sinister labs touts on the front of the package 20 grams of protein and I actually have a recipe in the back here if you want to make a monster ice cream cookie sandwich it's basically taking two of these cookies and then using this soft and scoop your favorite ice cream making the sandwich so reading off the country the content of this like I said it's fairly high caloric product it's 310 calories to the cooking 12 grams of fat 6 grams of saturated fat four grams of mono not mono saturated fat two grams of polyunsaturated fat zero grams trans fat 30 milligrams cholesterol 400 milligrams of sodium 35 grams of carbs 3 diet 3 grams dietary fiber 7 grams of total sugars with 6 grams of added sugars and 20 grams of protein and then the last thing they got another sin fit product is a double layer protein bar and peanut butter crunch flavor gluten free 9 grams of protein powder on the back on the front then you look at the fact it's a very small nutritional content it's a 1 bar serving size 100 calories 4 and a half grams of fat 3 and a half grams of saturated fat half a gram of mono saturated fat half a gram of polyunsaturated fat no trans fats five milligrams cholesterol 120 milligrams of sodium 7 grams of carbs a gram of dietary fiber 3 grams of sugar which includes 2 grams of added sugar and 9 grams protein so that's it we are a little over the 10-minute mark this piece I apologize but the next step is hopefully later on tonight I will be doing the panel review with my two friends I will introduce them when we get there and I also give the name of the location of where I'm going to be doing this in the review as well but stay tuned for that and and just to be safe I'll just give you the the kind of the closing right now in terms of the referencing but like this video because I don't know how it's gonna go with the the Carolina Reaper this might be a short video so I don't know how it's gonna end per se if as a result of that but like this video we've comment down below subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already to watch past future videos and you can like me on my other social media channels on Facebook at Brian's jerky journey you can follow me on Twitter at BG jerking journey and you can also follow like me on my Instagram page lana brian circa journey so that'll do it i hope you enjoyed this part of the journey with me stay tuned for the real value part of it and I will see you that Thanks alright guys so we are here Reapers and handle testing for a wicked cuts beef jerky here Brian's jerky journey you know is the place to be notorious Brian Jean I'm joined to my left by Dan Sebelius and across from us Joel of retro we are at Ray Rock's Bar and Grill on Pelham Street in the tune Massachusetts right off of exit 93 exit 47 on brew 93 so um just full disclosure if there are four theories there might be there could be probably will be but just if you're watching this work and not safe for work there you go see you're Joel's got fresh I'm get ready so we'll see how hot this stuff is and yeah I'm glasses of milk here know where I have came here my milk here of course got the beer and then we got our jerky here see it's all welcome here which is a way to flip it but we're gonna start with the orange teriyaki then go over the Mesquite then we get hit with a Carolina killer and finish off with a bacon so tractor off maybe the bureau BR uh I don't have a pop-up on on this date all right so what I do when I check the gherkin I open the bag so as you know I already reviewed the packaging the messaging the content for each bag so we look at tenderness and texture and initial scent when you open the bag so the orange teriyaki which I purchased black right Bobo jerk no 25% off all right smells good he does yeah you've got a good smell and it's got a very soft texture to it so just enough good floppy this exact copy adjust yeah let's get good flop it's just right yeah I'm good this is terrible the good floppiness texture is good it's not flimsy though it's like they go you go give a little effort girl come on so pretend it isn't texture how would i rank this we're one to five five being the best and being the worst three and a half pull walk you to three and a half four I'll give it 4 and then Dan's already tasting it but sentence smells you got the initial scent on it smelt that sent the initial first person the scent was good yeah I like the scent it's got a very nice scent you can definitely smell kind of the citric the citrus of the orange and then kind of a into the teriyaki so same thing one out of five four and seven smelled and what do you think I like the five five all right now I'm gonna give this you know what I'll give it a five as well all right let's throw it [Music] so I've actually heard good things about this brand how about this particular flavor and I can see why I like it because it's um it's not like that's how hot we'll get that later right but it's got a nice chewiness to it so you click yeah wasn't tough to chew yeah but it wasn't enough it disintegrates either when you get back you guess so chase it with that so what would you give this one to five see I'm going for because I can't go because what if one of these is better than they can't go on well sort of case by case basis has a relation to the brand new so I'm gonna go for it with the right to be revisited yeah so just just so you know Joel sitting across from us is our City Council elect for our East District so I do here we get redistricting so many every so often so we're in central in the city with it and Joel is one of our two district city councilors was just elected and we'll be taking office in four days yes so I figured this would be a good time to him to kind of embrace the heat before he faces the real heat so this would be nothing of course all right all right the next one will be the whiskey barbecue [Music] all right all right and again another nice another nice scent eat will be fought equally floppy and I mean given the it's mesquite barbecue so it's a smoke barbecues got a kind of a smoky tape scent to it the texture again I think it's very similar to what we have the orange teriyaki so does kind of have a building yeah so you definitely have to wash your hands after you use this definitely when we believe when we do the Carolina killer and have to wash our hands because you get any of that in our eyes and really imagine that burning sensations exactly so so one two five will be give it so I gave it I give the other one a three and a half ago the same shoe and go all right choose screw I'll be I like to give like rounded out like even number so I'll give us a three again it's kind of similar to the teriyaki which I kind of gave a four but I think the texture on the hands afterwards is kind of a bad taste but I don't think it's going to be a silly bad experience because I have a feeling that it's gonna taste well we after we smell it and chew it and so I'll give it a three on the tenderness and texture itself scent it smells so gonna kind of smell the as soon as you open you able to get that smell and it was good this you know you you have to really bring it up close to smell it yeah let's take a smell to see it I'll give it a four and what a state consistent in terms of the what I gave the orange teriyaki I like barbecue mesquite taste another brands like it it's good so I'll give it a four it takes him it really takes a lot I think to give it a five music there was one brand that I'd done a couple episodes ago where it was five across the board and I think that was very unique backers as it relates to how this package to present its own but yeah so let's throw in our months and see how it tastes [Music] he's got a little bit of heat you get that little plate like little heat once it goes down if you have to chase down a little bit this a might need to take a little drink at the Wow I like the application yeah it sticks with you a little bit even after you swallow it it's like you're looking for yeah I'll give that a for Frank you see I would do if I was going like if I could go I'd go for a quarter actually I'd give that little better school than they are in teriyaki see I would put teriyaki one higher but it's perfect I like the I like it's still there yep still there now I feel bad cuz we're gonna hit the Carolina killer after this and I hope that taste goes away yeah we might have to chase it with the UH but definitely it be chasing the milks that we hope bread popcorn and even the pier for that yeah so alright so moment of truth throughout the nine-minute mark you're halfway there [Music] right caution extreme he is nervous all right I have my daughter's card she said if I do my pants I'm not allowed to drive her car let's say her I'd be upset here my feeling right now is because we had that mesquite it might offset whatever it's like you never keep this is gonna get but we'll find out in a second and holy crap look at that I'm right here I can look at that already look at that that's a huge piece I think that's Dan yeah see I I have no problem depending on how we initially receive this I've just splitting this between the three of us man up get a place I go big or go home right all right cool all right don't be home but give the big one yeah let's see what's next so I'm liking the texture all around it's got you know I know what it is but my sense is at like you know the touch sense is just telling me it feels fresh so I'm gonna say I'm like you get in - hats off to wicked cuts here cuz it's not you're not gonna anything dry but I get anything you know that crumbles and falls apart yep so when you have three different flavors kind of says maybe it's not you know the one cut maybe it's just the way the way this company's preparing their product and ship it out and you know the vacuum bag might have something to do with it as well yeah oh yeah what I mean and this is pretty much this that's a thing those for what it's worth this is a standard in terms of how all this all these brands for the most part pairs with a vacuum sealed bag so well I'm thinking the mold you know most of us know we buy any plane so what I want to know it's a plastic see-through bag yeah yeah he's got the foil bag oh I see what you're saying because it's because it's not like allowing any sunlight in yeah dry then never thought of it like it's actually a good point because that's probably it probably helps so like I reviewed what I heard real damn good jerky was overdue whatever good yesterday that side of the bag was completely exposed and it just felt dry and maybe it's because of maybe looking inside here it's got you know that aspect of there is no thief the foil kind of preserves it especially considering if this is being fulfilled on a Bob South Lake Texas and I know for a fact when I ordered the aren't teriyaki in the Mesquite you it's I know it's sacrilegious buck you know the old Bill Cosby himself special plays in the dentist's chair my but that's what I feel like imagine if I came here either oh that is that is good but you know what how is he it's the smell happy with that no no no no every once in a while once it up another one that's yeah retirement so to be fair it wasn't as far as I thought it was gonna be no I expected like I expected be like pass out on the floor like so I don't know if you guys saw the Facebook thing that they did with Chris Komorowski but like he was like sweating profusely and he had like maybe maybe this much barely could finish have a vagus my guess is no no no where the others I could that aren't area they bought through that bag in like a minute a half oh yeah dances this is probably a good I like this people that love the spicy stuffing today all day all right well I think that's something you do like what we just did I got a bunch of buddies over to this will you pass it up you give it to a yeah like we've got the Hartman's teriyaki now you're sneaking one yeah and then you see you then you watching reaction that's not that's not our half that off with whiskey oh okay wicked cuts that was wicked good I'm gonna get out looking good that said something here in New England yeah all right a bigger pistol wicked pissah that's what I've done alright now it's maybe took like four pieces but it's it let's try to hit me but wow I'm gonna go four and a half boy that's true it didn't disappoint me yeah yeah the consistency of the chewiness across the first three brands has been the same yeah don't easy to chew it's not rough and I don't want to have jerky like it's stuck in your teeth yep this I think I'm eating this yeah I mean sometimes economy the plastic right now yeah all right so and I have this much left there so [Music] yeah I'm not disappoint you know those this gonna win just gonna one really bad oh yeah this is not as bad as I anticipated I'm glad because when I did the package review I actually said the closings are all my social media stuff on my cams gonna do it now instead of later because I don't know I'm gonna be a movie later on about that question so or 3/4 away there but I feel like we saved the best for last because now shouldn't be applewood smoked bacon um so uh yeah so it might take on bacon jerky is if you're looking at if you're looking at bacon jerky is a viable health alternative no this is like so what did you get the turkey turkeys if you have the other types of material so turkey jerky is not bad I like it I'm just the only exotic that I've tried thus far has been the salmon and gives teriyaki salmon so it was think it's an acquired taste I think that's the case with jerky in general like you have if you never had and you have it you don't necessarily how to do it we'll just top it with you so um yeah it's got a nice Center at the table oh yeah it wasn't too bad that's right dude I had for PETA's dude I had four pieces on top of that so I think I've got my seat fill and it's it's hot so all right what least I could do is let you pick the bacon jerky that you want do you deserve that heaven yeah it's destroyed as far as I'm concerned bacon Jerky's at five across rewards this is applewood smoked uncured it's cutting through the heat on the last one that's actually probably good thing to do that yeah well I mean it's not really the same bacon versus beef so and then I get to me this was just kind of like a bonus thing I work and I look at bacon jerky like I said it's that's a treat it's gonna most likely be good regardless so so with every order that you get from wicked cuts they will send you what's called a synthetic protein cookie that and then yeah so when I got it it's it's cool actually so as I met I created in the in the first half of this video you can actually take two of these put some ice cream on it make a cookie sanitizer so but I'm gonna give you guys a choice because you guys have definitely earned it thank you for taking time out of your day and weekend to come out to choose yeah so that's a synthetic protein bar that's fine I will take whatever is not whatever is left over I'll take it's good right the bacon did it so I'll talk him in everything up take notes in terms of [Music] [Music] turn 10 calories just for the cookies all this will take some of the things they would sell my gym definitely sounds like something that I imagine with the ice cream I'm making a No I was going to cut that happens at once oh that's two of those to watch I mean even the small hat I had wasn't chalky like most protein snack this is 100 calories right here you can tell the serving size it has to be a hundred calories or it's just nice little drizzle chocolate right there enough document the other nutritional content translates to we do WWE Walker boys how that works out so this is a peanut butter crunch Joel all right so whatever we have whatever full glasses we have some big shears here yeah thanks Joel

paper to rinse the mushrooms and cut them into quarters get out 2 pounds 0.91 kilograms of button or cremini mushrooms and pull off the stems rinse the mushroom caps under cold water to remove any dirt or debris then cut each cap into quarters discard the stems or add them to the pot when you make vegetable stock 3 mix the mushrooms with olive oil salt and pepper put the mushroom quarters into

the mushrooms for 30 more minutes return the baking sheet to the oven and let the mushrooms finish cooking they should become tender and they'll shrink a little since you removed the liquid that the mushrooms gave off they'll become browned and slightly caramelized instead of mushy 7 toss the mushrooms with chopped herbs and serve them turn off the oven and remove the baking sheet discard the

today I'll be sharing with you a simple recipe for cookies we'll be making cranberry cookies let's first prepare some dried cranberries chop them up finely this way they can be more evenly distributed within the cookies, making the cookies look nicer at the same time, the batter won't be as easy to crack when you cut it this should do put them in a small bowl, then add water to have them submerged in order to soften them up submerge them for 10 minutes should be enough, do not leave them in there for too long prepare some unsalted butter, cut it into small chunks you can soften up the butter under room temperature, or you can nuke it in the microwave for 5 seconds at a time aim for a consistency that when you stir it with an egg beater you won't feel any resistance if you feel any resistance when stirring, it indicates that you need to soften it up more but do not have the butter melt into a liquid either too soft or not soft enough will cause separation to occur when you add the eggs later use an electric beater to mix up the butter nicely if you manage to soften the butter into a suitable consistency it won't stick to the the beater head in clumps when you stir it using an electric beater add sugar use low speed first to prevent the sugar from flying everywhere then switch to high speed and beat it until the sugar completely dissolves add some salt I'd suggest measuring it out using a measuring cup, since we don't need too much of it there's always a chance for you to measure out too much due to the kitchen balance being not that sensitive to smaller amounts keep beating it at high speed, until the color of that butter becomes lighter and its volume increases and they show a feather-like pattern add the full eggs you need to add the eggs in two doses\t\t wait for the eggs and the butter fully combines together then add the rest this is to prevent a separation from forming add cake flour if you have almond meal you can add some almond meal according to the proportions shown on screen now this makes the cookies more fragrant use a scraper to mix the powder and butter together until there's no dry clumps left in the mixture drain the cranberries we prepared use paper towels to dry them of the excessive water then add them to the batter use a scraper to evenly distribute the chopped up cranberry raisins prepare a piece of plastic wrap knead the dough into a long piece which is about 4 cm in diameter make sure the batter does not have any air pockets inside then roll it up, then roll it around, this is to make it's thickness consistent throughout if you have molds for cranberry cookies, you can use the mold to shape them it is fine if you don't though you can just find a couple of boxes like I did put the batter in the middle the two boxes are roughtly 4cm spaced apart from each other then use that space between the boxes, press that batter into a square shape with angles a ruler can be used to assist in this process turn it 90 degrees, press it in every directions if the two ends are slightly thiner, use the plastic wrap to shape it a little more but if you've left a lot of wrinkles when you put on the plastic wrap you can open it, flatten it, then roll it up again then adjust it a little in the end, making it into a 4cm square or ranctangle at last, set it on a baking pan or something with a flat surface put it in the freezer to have it freeze for around 45 minutes before we start baking it preheat the oven 20 minutes ahead of time to a 165\u00b0C/330\u00b0F the time you need for preheating your oven is determined by the exact model of your oven and the temperature you need to reach every oven is different take out the frozen batter use a sharp knife to cut it into 6mm thin slices the frozen batter shouldn't be soft when you cut it but it's also not exactly tough to a point where it breaks or bends when you try to cut it if your dough became too hard from being frozen, you may need to thaw it out a little heat it in the microwave for 5 seconds, it'd be easier to cut after that cut the slices into consistent thickness as much as you can, this is to make sure heat is evenly distributed to each individual piece but the cookies into a baking pan with a layer of silicon padding or parchment sheet you need to space out the cookies, give them space to puff up then put the baking pan into the middle layer of the oven, bake for 20-23 minutes the exact temperature is to be adjusted according to the condition of your oven and you need to pay attention during the last few minutes when their edge gets a little brown, this means they are ready wait until they won't burn off your fingers transfer them to a grill and have them cool off then you'll get the crunchy texture compared to the other cookie recipe, these cranberry cookies are easier to make since they contain more flour content they won't lose their patterns and shapes that easily a perfect cranberry cookie are perfectly browned when you crack them open, the colors inside are supposed to be even, there won't be anything that is semi-transparent they'd taste crispy on the outside, but cursty in the inside the sour flavor from the cranberries neutralizes the overwhelming sweet flavor from the cookies while also enriching the texture of the cookies the recipe is also very simple, it's quite suitable for

that you can put on like your toast or your crackers and stuff and we're going to make a kumquat and black cracked black pepper jelly if you want to use like jalapenos totally fine i don't have jalapenos right now so i'm just trying to use up things that i have in the fridge and freezer so i'm just trying to get it out jamming season yay it's not yet but it's okay [Music] wash thoroughly our jars okay i have them fully submerged in hot water you want a nice big pot for this all right i'm using a canning jar lifter it makes it easier to grab the jars out of the hot water in a medium pot i'm taking 298 grams of cut up strawberries i'm using frozen because i froze them the day before i'm taking 420 grams of frozen peaches i cut them in the summer i'm just finally using them up i'm using a grapefruit simple syrup i used grapefruit peel and equal parts water to sugar i'm using 76 grams of this liquid you can use it with any citrus peel or you can just do straight up sugar and water if you want to add a little lemon juice to it that's fine so we're adding pectin strawberries naturally have pectin but we're adding a bit more i'm using 17 grams of pectin and i'm putting it on medium high heat on the stove [Music] i'm using a small pot so i'm washing my kumquats thoroughly i'm de-stemming them i'm quartering them and i'm taking out the seeds and the white center so that's the inside of a kumquat it's quite interesting it's different from most fruit that you normally think of for citrus the skin is actually sweet and the inside is sour i have 166 grams of kumquat now that i'm done i recommend cutting them a lot smaller so i'm adding in 41 grams of white sugar and i'm putting in 68 grams of the grapefruit simple syrup but you can just add equal parts sugar and water i'm gonna be adding in about half a gram of cracked black pepper i'm just going around the the grinder a couple turns we're adding in half a cup of water and 22 grams of pectin let's cover it and put it on mediums heat on the stove [Music] i'm just taking a potato masher to our peach and strawberry jam just trying to break up the pieces of strawberry and the pea you need to sanitize the jars by boiling them in a rapid boil for at least 10 minutes and they need to be submerged fully with an inch of water at least covering them [Music] okay so here's our kumquat i'm just starting to smash it [Music] we're just going to taste the peach pretty strong on the uh grapefruit really yeah it's not too sweet not too sweet there you go okay we're just gonna try our kumquat we've got jelly cracked black pepper kumquat jelly tea i think we want more black pepper that's better okay so we're just taking our tanner pouring out all the water just drying it on the inside with clean hands please [Music] okay lid on other lid on ready so we full turn squeeze and then one half little okay let's pull out the rest take it pour all the water out okay our first jar of our kumquat into the bin so remember all the way closed right [Music] all the way closed one half turn one half trip okay and they go they need to boil fully submerged for 10 minutes okay let's pull them out [Music] so here they are when they're cool they're gonna pop it might scare you but uh so that's your favorite warning okay bye guys i'll see you next time baking fiat out don't forget to like comment share and subscribe and hit that bell okay see ya", "yFSLCm7BiEs": "hi everyone welcome to my channel and I hope you really like this video since this is my first video if you could like and subscribe that would really help me a lot and I'm really excited to upload this video so my first review I remember will be on Ghost this is totally unspun surd and these are just my own opinions but I really hope this can help you when you're buying new PCs and proteins and maybe you're scared because as we all know they're quite expensive so when you're buying something you want to make sure it tastes good before you buy it instead of suffering from the whole container but they're really not tasting good so I hope that this review can help out these are my honest opinions and I hope you enjoyed the video and so today we will be reviewing ghosts so I'm very excited so let's first go over the proteins so first off I'll start with the vegan protein because I actually was so shocked I tried some vegan proteins before which tastes totally disgusting so actually I'm really impressed with this one so I'm already done as you can see it is empty but this was the peanut butter peanut butter cereal milk flavor and it was so good if you like peanut butter flavor this is definitely one you will want to buy it tastes exactly like that PB 2 I think it's what it's called the powdered peanut butter in case exactly like it but a little bit sweeter and more like that cereal look flavor if you've had the original cereal milk of ghosts it tastes like that but very like peanut buttery um this one is really good in oatmeal and you just have to really mix it in because it is quite thick because it is vegan protein I usually add more almond milk to it because I don't really like you really thick consistency so I would suggest just adding more milk if you don't like the thickness and if you do like really thick oatmeal this is great this is also great just to drink in shakes you can just drink it straight in water and it tastes amazing so as you can see it sorry come on so there's like nothing left in there oh and I also wanted to say back I always thought these were like stickers how we're in the thing but don't throw these away they're in each tub of anything you buy with ghosts and it's actually a redemption code so I would suggest 4d media because actually we get like 200 points and I think once you get I don't remember how many thousand points but then you can get free stuff with these points so I thought it was like a sticker or something in there but it is not a reward point so if you opened a packet on the backside it'll be like a little code and you should use it for sure but yeah this Viper is amazing for vegan protein it's only being a protein one I have tried but I would definitely definitely order it again I would give this a 10 out of 10 for flavor it's you so good and it's super good and oatmeal so it also passes the oatmeal test flavor I got which is a super popular one I think it's probably their most popular one would be bu cereal milk flavored so this is um weight protein no vegan but I believe they do have it in the DM protein too but I can only speak about the way one because it's only when I ordered so yeah so cereal milk this is super good I will say I really did not like it in oatmeal I only tried it once so maybe I need to try it again but I did not like it and oatmeal it makes it taste a little bitter but it's warmed up but you know protein is not meant to be consumed before so that is a possibility with any protein I did not like this and in a real warm but on the milk but I would say drinking this with water is the best and I also put this in if I make like a smoothie Bowl this is like the perfect kind of vanilla sweet flavor that's not overpowering to like the fruits you put in the smoothie and it's super good so also I just drink this this is my go-to drink right after workouts if I know I'm not gonna eat something directly after so I will drink one scoop of this and just water and about eight ounces of water and I think their recommended let's see what does the recommended I think it says 60 ounces a 150 to 200 milliliters of water so yeah that's how it mix it if it's too sweet for you because it is on the sweeter side I would just add more water and it will make it less sweet but it tastes great um yeah and then the next flavor will be let's see which one I grab coffee ice cream so this is great I just got this about two weeks ago but I couldn't wait to open it and just try it on camera so I had opened it already they've had it in oatmeal in the morning and a couple of times so it does really good it'll feel like really really good so no problems there it's oatmeal approved it's fine if it's warm yeah it's really really good so oh and I didn't go over the calories and grams of protein but it's 120 calories which really isn't bad 25 grams of protein it has 3 grams of carbs and sugars 1 gram but honestly one gram of sugar is fine for protein shakes unless you're trying to do like no sugar but I mean I eat more sugar in the fruits I eat so I don't see a problem with it and yeah under 20 collar is really good for a protein shake I found them well started like around 160 so it's a little bit on the lower side and yeah I really like it tastes really good also in water so all of these actually tastes really good on water I'm so surprised because before it was not a water protein shake kind of person but all of these entireties totally amazing I would definitely recommend them they're so good and yeah you can't go wrong and my last flavor I just got something just got in this last order he did I just got an order from ghost about two weeks ago that I ran out of everything almost and so I got the cinnamon cereal look because I've heard a lot of reviews on this that we're really really good and I will agree it's super good it is not my number one I think I would say my number one is either the vegan peanut butter or and the coffee so this one's really good but it's a little on the sweeter side so if you don't like really sweet protein I would say this is very sweet but tastes exactly like cereal look and I think it's called captain it's a Captain Crunch or what was the cereal I just always eat when I want the candidate is exactly spot-on like this and it was very sweet but it's super good so I would say this is also very good in oatmeal soap passes the oatmeal test is fine warm and tastes normal it doesn't taste weird this one has a little more calories so 130 with 25 grams of protein which is really good and this one's also good and water but I do say I usually add about like 2 more ounces of water in it because I don't like how sweet it is sometimes so it depends if I'm in the sweet mood if I'm not I just add some more water but this is also really good I think I didn't say um is that it's always really nice when you get goes because the they have this like lip I don't know if you can see it I didn't take off the thing all the way just lit on the top where they can help me show if I can put it um you can put the little scooper rigosso you to bend this scoop and they can sit right on top which is so nice because it is the most annoying thing in the world when you are trying to find the scooper and it's at the bottom of the container when you get it that is literally the worst thing and then you end up losing a bunch of products by just going everywhere so yeah it's super good this one also has 3 grams of sugar so it's a little higher it is sweeter so it doesn't surprise me that this is higher but it was really good too I would say it's my food wising third favorite I would say goes tie for number one would be the coffee and the vegan peanut butter and then from that it would be the way the cereal cereal book did not pass the the onio test and I like eating oatmeal with protein in the morning so I would say that was not so good I'm sorry that you go change little bit I just got a delivery from Amazon I've been waiting for a bye Phil so my chess game and I needed to answer the door before they thought I wasn't here so sorry about the Engel change but it's perfect timing because now we can go over the two BCAA flavors so we'll start with my hands-down favorite BCA I think I've ever had in my whole entire life so and this is called the sour green apple amino by ghost and the difference between their BCA's and their amino is it has the coconut water powder so it's really good if you're working out in the morning I'm to stay hydrated so like usually when I was at work before we're all doing home office I would go before work at 5:30 in the morning to the gym and then go to work I'm just a morning workout person other thing is you feel so dehydrated when you're working out right in the morning even if you drink water before so this really helps me especially if I'm going to do cardio in the morning not die while I'm on the treadmill so it really does feel like you're more hydrated and I really think it works and this is literally the best tasting thing I've ever had in my life so a taste I wouldn't say like warheads because I haven't had a warhead since I was a little kid I'm sorry I really don't know what that cat candy tastes like but I would say it tastes exactly like the green Jolly Ranchers exactly like hands-down same you think you're drinking like a green jolly rancher like liquid it's the best I will for sure order this flavor again it does hands down my favorite I only have two right now of the VCAs but I planned and add more to my collection because it is so good like it tastes amazing I cannot um recommend it enough it's seriously my favorite BCA's ever I think but as you can see it's gone so it's a very sad day it's gone it um ran out about maybe two weeks ago but I drink theses like every time I work out because I also have a very seat to send meat seem to help with that a little bit because it tastes like candy honestly so yeah it helps me work out to less or and as well as crave my sweet tooth a little bit so that's really nice and I really like it and my next let me know that I just got in my order from two weeks ago would be the amino mango this is also super good so it tastes exactly like mangos it's definitely a close second to the green apple I think they both taste amazing and I would definitely order them both again um but I would say green apples definitely my number one this is very close second though so same thing and because me knows mango and it's really good so I'm drinking about two scoops in about 24 ounces of water and during my workout I usually take a pump or a pre-workout before I work out it depends I'm trying to take pre-workout less I was taking about like four times a week I work out seven days a week right now due to hard seventy-five challenge and so yeah I work out every day so it's nice to get a pick-me-up everyone smile but I am trying to drink less caffeine because I definitely drink too much I like coffee I do like pre-workout so I'm trying to limit myself on that but this I'm drinking everyday aminos everyday so when I work out I usually always I'm doing 24 ounces with two scoops they're recommended and dosages you can do one or two scoops so two scoops is fine it's not too much and yeah it's so good so I definitely feel less sore with this I do do weight lifting and at least six times a week a usual seventh day because I'm doing that challenge right now I will do like yoga or I don't know hit it depends how sore and like exhausted I am but I do some kind of activity so yeah this really helps with lifting days um and my final product by goes which I also got in my order I did pretty big order um about two weeks ago is there a pump because I was looking for a not caffeinated kind of pre-workout and thanks so this is their nitric oxide and it is good so I got it in power watermelon flavored the warheads again but um yeah it's good I'm not the biggest watermelon fan I will say like watermelon watermelons the fruit I love but watermelon flavor stuff I would say it's not my favorite um but this case are really good it is more sour than the green apple one I would say the green apple aminos is not very sour it kind of gives like John Ranchers so super sour but this one is sour so I would say it's definitely following warheads it is very sour so it is like Waterman the flavor is really good but it is sour and this one from mixability wasn't my favorite um amongst all ghost products they mix great so protein mix is great BCA mix is great and just shake your bottles with water so usually there's no chunks at all I never have a problem this one is a little more chunky but I think it's just because of how it's made I think a lot of not nitric oxide is a little harder to make so I mix it with the shaker bottle and water a lot and it mixes well but it is harder to mix them the other one I'm sometimes maybe you get a little chunks but nothing like gross so all the mix ability super good and this flavor is amazing I do really feel like it helps me on days I don't want to take pre-workout so it gives me a little pumped up ready for my workout but without making me feel like caffeine or yeah too jittery or anything like that I have not tried the ghost pre-workout yet but I am planning to do that for my next video so M if you have any recommendations on flavors I should get I was thinking about getting the new bubblegum strawberry flavored one and maybe I don't know sour patch red berry that looked really good if you have any recommendations or you want to see any me try any flavors please drop them below in the comments so I can know what to order because I plan to do that probably next week so yeah please let me know and I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you have a good rest of your day or night or whenever you're watching this and thank you and I hope this is helpful for you", "iLiY6_nyWCU": "hello everyone and welcome back to cherry lanes where today we're gonna go through how to make these buttery flaky baby croissants you're going to make this over two days where you'll make the dough one day before and it's an excellent activity where you can get your friends over and you can roll them all out over the weekend before i get straight into the ingredients however i think it's worth noting that if you live in a really warm or humid environment it's going to be a bit challenging for you to work with these croissants so i wouldn't recommend you working on them unless you're able to roll them all out in an air-conditioned area because i would hate for you to spend all your time effort and money and end up not being able to achieve the results alright enough talking and let's get straight into it so you will need 225 grams of baker's flour 25 grams of plain flour 32.5 grams of caster sugar 5 grams of a whole egg and we'll save the rest for the egg wash 5 grams of bread improver 7 grams of dried instant yeast 4 grams of salt 72.5 grams of cold water 72.5 grams of full fat milk and as you can see i'm using a jewelry scale here that i got from ebay for about seven dollars as a lot of kitchen scales can't wait to a 0.5 gram accuracy but it's not super important because um from what i've witnessed is that probably a tiny little drop of water or a tiny drop of milk will equate to a 0.5 gram edition but i would say that it's worth looking into so that you can accurately measure out your 5 grams of bread improver or 7 grams of yeast and last but not least you will also need 125 grams of unsalted butter for laminating here i'm using low pot which is a danish butter with excellent plasticity and also scored fairly well in my flavor test so if you want to know more about butters i recommend you check out my battle of the butters video so that you can choose the correct butter for making these results all right now when it comes to making the dough start by ensuring your hands are super duper clean i'm sure we're all pros by now thanks to 20 20. here i'm also using a nail brush and i've cut my nails really short so the nail brush will help me ensure that i really don't have any dirt or dead skin cells stuck under my nails you can of course also use food safe gloves if you prefer now once that's done in a medium sized bowl mix together all of the dry ingredients just using a hand whisk so that's the baker's flour plain flour caster sugar bread improver yeast and salt so as you're mixing along you want to really make sure that you get the sides as well as the middle and you can also turn the bowl as you mix around because you really need to make sure that the yeast and the bread improver is thoroughly incorporated throughout this whole dry ingredient mix once that's done using a ladle or a spatula simply push all of the dry ingredients towards the side of your bowl creating this little great wall of flour you don't have to be super precise so once it looks something like this simply mix together all of your wet ingredients into a small bowl and simply pour it in if you have a bread maker or a dough hook attachment for your electric mixes you can simply use that on a low setting for just five minutes but here i'm going to show you how to do so with only your fingers as you can see here my fingers are closed together and just very slowly you want to just keep stirring it in so that all the flowers get gradually incorporated with the wet ingredients you essentially just want to become the dough hook so i've set my timer there um you only want to do this for five minutes max i only did it for about four minutes so as you go around slowly keep stirring until all the flowers just mix together it's gonna be a bit sticky to start with but do it slow and don't rush this step and as you can see once it starts to clump together it's going to be a bit hard to keep stirring it so you just split your finger open and stab and twist and stab and twist and as you keep rolling around it's going to get stuck to your fingers just use your other hand and remove it from your fingertips and throw it back into the bowl and now that it's getting much more clumped together get your thumbs in there and just bend and fold in like so so you see i'm just pressing in and don't forget to get the sides get all your side pieces in there as well they want to be loved so scrape that in and put it back into your dough and using your thumbs you press it in and bend and fold and bend and fold and you want to be careful not to over like knead it so you don't want to press it down you want it to remain kind of elastic so you have to become the dough hook again and as you can see it's a bit tougher now for you to use two fingers so you just use both hands and you kind of just pull the dough a little bit as you bend it back in so that the door maintains its sort of elasticity so here as you can see i'm kind of just pulling it out and folding it back in pulling it out and kind of rolling it in and as you can see i still have one minute left on my clock meaning that i've only worked the dough for four minutes and now it's already ready for the next step now using cooking spray generously coat a chopping mat or you can use a baking tray with some oil and then you dump your dough on top and just very gently you can see i'm using all my fingers to just spread it out like so where you're like just pulling the dough out to make it spread without creating any holes till it's approximately 6 by 7.5 inches now loosely cover it with some cling wrap pressing down the sides to ensure all the edges are air tight now simply write down what time you finish this step and leave it on your counter at room temperature for one hour to rest before putting it in the fridge to rest overnight for 24 hours and now let's go on to laminating our butter so the only special equipment i recommend you using are these two high quality bep approved pvc pipes which are australian standard and also get two of its fitted caps and wash them really thoroughly you should be able to get these meter long pipes from your local hardware store and cut them down to any size however if you can't find them you can also just use whatever wooden rolling pin that you have now in laminating the butters start with a really long sheet of baking paper and fold that in half pressing down firmly to create a nice clean edge now open it back up and as you can see i've sliced my butter into approximately one centimeter thick slices and you want to place it about an inch away from the line you created this is so that as we hit the butter down it's not going to cause your baking paper to just rip so roughly place it like so into a rough shape like a rectangle or square because we're going to try to achieve about a six inch square so fold that back over nicely and using a rolling pin here we're using the pvc pipe without the caps attached and you want to firmly just hit the butter to laminate it so as you can see i'm like hitting it like this and then you turn it around and continue doing so the reason why we want to keep turning as we hit and laminate the butter is so that it's spreading in more than just one direction so you just keep doing so ensuring you're not using full force because that can also cause you to rip your baking paper so just keep doing that until it looks something like this and if you can start to see your baking paper start to crumple like this simply just open it back up and smooth it back over because we want to ensure that we can achieve a really nice and smooth even layer of laminated butter now once it looks like this just fold in the edge like so pressing firmly so it creates another nice clean edge now do the same thing on the other side where the width you have created is now approximately six inches because that was the width that we had roughly spread the dough out before putting it in the fridge so if previously when you were making your dough you didn't exactly have six inches don't worry about it just ensure that when you laminate the butter is approximately the same width of the dough you had spread out if that makes sense okay so once you achieve this step continue hitting your butter to spread it out and a quick camera change now so you can see it from my point of view so once it looks something like this where it's almost going to reach the six inch square shape fold off the final corner and press down firmly like so so that it creates this approximate six inch by six inch square and then you continue plasticizing it by hitting the butters down ensuring that you try to spread it out um towards all the corners and once it looks something like this you gradually just use the rolling pin to smooth it out so that you can push it towards the corner by then your butter should have softened and plasticized enough for this part to be easy enough without ripping your paper and as you can see i'm trying to hold the rolling pin as level as i can as i just very gently press it down and smush it out until it's all spread towards the edges like this so you just smush it out and just gently smush it out and there you go turn it and do so for all the edges and after i do that i like to run my hands over to just feel how flat it is and then use the rolling pin to go over it again to try to level it out as much as i can and once you're happy with that your laminated butter sheet should be approximately three to four millimeters thick and now you stick it in the fridge until your dough is ready to work with so it's now 24 hours since our dough has been resting in the fridge and depending on how wide and long you laminated your butter out that will be the guide for what size you should roll that first layer of dough so imagine the outlines on this piece of paper is the dough and this is the size of my laminated butter sheet approximate what half of the height of that butter is and that is exactly how much longer you should roll your dough out while maintaining the same width as that butter sheet you want to make sure that your dough will be divisible by three as you will fold the top third of the dough over the butter and then the butter and dough over the top of the first fold so start by lightly dusting your workbench with some plain flour or baker's flour using this flick of the wrist number three motion and then remove your dough from refrigeration it should look poofy like this it doesn't matter that your dough looks uneven now give it a rough swirl on your bench so that it picks up some of the flour that you've dusted this will help prevent your dough from sticking on your counter lightly dust the top as well and so now we're trying to achieve the dough shape that we previously went through before so you grab your laminated butter so you can continue to approximate exactly how wide and long you should be rolling out your first layer of dough so here i'm using the rolling pin with the caps attached because the caps happen to be approximately four millimeters thick so this will really help us out in our rolling out process where we won't accidentally over flatten our dough so once i got it to the shape that i want and i just cleaned up the edges a bit to make it nice and roughly rectangle it doesn't have to be perfect remove your laminated butter where it had been sitting on my counter for about five minutes so it's bendable as you can see now as i place it onto my dough i try to double check at the bottom to make sure that it's really placed on my dough and you can kind of just stretch out the dough a little bit to make sure that your butter is within your dough like what i'm doing here and you can see that my butter is bendable as i'm picking this up you can kind of tell and you rub the top layer a bit so that you can soften the butter and it'll help to make it a bit easier for you to peel off your baking paper so i'm just slowly very slowly peeling it off and perfect so now we're gonna do our first fold so the top layer of dough over the top like this and i just even it out slightly doesn't have to be perfect once again and then you see how bendable my butter is and we fold it over and there you go your first fold looks like this where the opening should be on your right hand side now just for us to keep track so you grab your rolling pin again and firmly press down like so this will help to evenly spread out your butters as we try to roll it out and i press it down once in this direction just to widen it slightly and periodically always try to pick up your dough to make sure that the bottom is not trying to stick onto your counter and lightly dust it flower again if it is and lightly dust the top continue pressing it down as we roll it along so the goal for our second fold now is to roll it out till it's approximately twice the length of our first fold so here i'm just rolling it and as you can see i'm rolling in really short small motions like this and i like to turn my dough around to ensure i'm not just working it in one direction and this will also help me ensure that i'm rolling the dough out more evenly and now that i've got my dough to almost twice the length of my first fold maybe a little bit more but it doesn't have to be super precise grab both ends of your dough and fold it towards the middle like so so this is called the book fold doesn't it look like a book and now i just grab the middle edges a bit to even it out just make it a little bit neater and now we just close the book and that's it this is your final fold let it rest on your counter for about 5 to 10 minutes or you can let it rest in the fridge for about 10 minutes and once it's rested dust a little bit of flour over the top just very little and then using your rolling pin just push down like so as you have always been doing and just gradually push it down ensuring that it's not stuck to your counter as always and roll it out i also like to flip my dough around to ensure that the bottom layer is also getting rolled out evenly so the goal here now is to roll your dough out till it is only four millimeters thin because four millimeters is the magic number in pastry making here you can see that if you hadn't rested your dough enough in the final stage of your folding you'll notice the gluten is fighting against you as you're trying to roll it out and down to four mils so if you notice your dough doing that leave your dough alone for about two minutes before you continue rolling it out and once that's done use a pastry brush to dust off any of the excess flour using a really sharp knife now cut the edges in a downward motion like this do not drag your knife because if you do that you can end up sealing all the beautiful layers that you have created and that is not what we want so now i'm just roughly trying to gauge how i'm going to cut them down into one inch wide strips so i start in the middle cutting it into half and i like to move the strips away so that it doesn't just sort of the layers don't melt together it wouldn't really but this is just an extra precaution that i take and now you cut off the edges so that you can reveal from the get-go all these lovely layers so that's exactly how you should see them okay so now we just cut the dough into little 45 degree triangles like this it doesn't have to be super precise and if you're not confident with how fast you can roll this all out i highly recommend that you section off maybe two of the strips and place it on your slicing mat or you can put it on a baking tray with baking paper cover it with cling wrap and stick it in the fridge until you're ready to work with and i'm going to show you how you roll it so you cut the edge like this turn it around twist it down roll roll roll pull the edge continue to roll it over roll it like this there we go and then punch it down that's all so i'm going to show a close-up now so you cut the edge pinch it down and the less fingers you use to touch the better so that you don't accidentally melt your butter layers so you roll it down pull it and then continue rolling and then just bend and there you have it so continue doing so for the rest of your baby croissants and you're going to be a pro by the end of this and now we're going to proof them which means allowing the yeast to ferment in the dough as it produces gases allowing our baby croissants to double in size before we bake them this is what will give it its light flaky crunch so do not skip this step if you're proofing in a colder environment it is going to take a lot longer for the croissants to double in size so what i recommend is that if it's possible turn the air conditioning of one bedroom to 23 degrees celsius and proof the croissants for 2.5 to 3 hours until doubled in size now use the rest of your egg that you saved from the ingredients before add half a teaspoon of milk to it give it a good mix and very lightly brush the egg wash over your croissants be very careful not to use too much egg or you might end up accidentally sealing your croissant layers so as you can see i'm just very carefully trying to just brush the top front and back without brushing the sides where you can see those layers the reason for this is so that you don't seal the layers but the egg wash will give this croissant a lovely deep brown after they're baked once that's done stick them in the middle section of your preheated oven using the fan force setting at 165 degrees celsius for 17 to 18 minutes turning your tray around halfway through to ensure more even baking until you achieve a deep golden brown it is completely normal to see your croissant slightly oozing bubbles like this any more than that where you see a pool of butter it means you may have proofed your croissants in too warm and environment now remove them while you bring your temperature down to 145 degrees celsius then bake for another four minutes and you're done these croissants are seriously just so deliciously buttery flaky and crunchy and as you eat more and more you really don't feel like you're eating too much so it's dangerously addictive i really wish i had a whole job but i finished everything in just two days and it makes me really sad that i didn't have any to munch on while editing this video anyway if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to

aka suga and welcome to the channel today's bake pretty amazing bake it is a very famous bake that can be found on netflix it can be found on websites it can be found talked about in social media it is all over the place today's bake is from milk bar if you're not familiar with milk bar in new york city it was the brainchild of christina tossy and david chang it is an amazing place and what we're going to make today is the milk bar pie aka used to be known as crack pie so it is a it's very similar if you're in the south it's very kind i would say it's a relative of a chess pie but oh my goodness if you can make this thing you will it is totally worth it and if you can order one i recommend that too because they do sell them and ship them and i've done that a few times in their cookies and that is awesome to do so i'll put a link to their website down in the description below um this is a very very sweet dessert and i cannot wait for you to bake it with me it's very different but i think you're going to learn some pretty cool things about it it's uh it's frozen the pie after you make it you actually stick it in the freezer but there's a few steps involved you make an oat cookie then that oak cookie becomes the crust of the pie and then we make the filling very simple feeling but you have to be very exact with your ingredients and also uh you know take your time work through it make sure you get everything exactly right but if you follow the step by step it will turn out unbelievable so please if you like the channel if you like what i'm doing please tell somebody about it go down the corner hit the subscribe button every week posting a new recipe in here i'm going to start doing some cookbooks so i'm going to do some recipes of mine do some recipes from tv maybe some movies if you want to see something if you want to see me trying to make something please leave a description or leave a comment down there tell me what you like about the channel tell me what you don't like about the channel if there's something you'd like to see me do i'd love to hear about that but with that let's make some crack pie so step one of this recipe from mukbar pie aka crack pie is to make an oat cookie so we're going to make this oat cookie we're going to put it on we're going to bake it on a sheet pan and then that's going to what's going to become our crust for the pie so the ingredients as you'll find listed go ahead and pre-measure everything out this is the part part of maybe the stand mixer then we're also going to use a food processor but you can also use a mix to do the whole thing but first things first we're going to take our butter we're going to cream our butter in the mixer this is just going to make a basic cookie the cookie is delicious you could eat the cookie even without the pie i mean honestly i've well honestly i have and it is amazing so i'm gonna cream this uh cream this butter real quick and i'm gonna add my sugars is brown sugar and granulated sugar both in there we're going to cream the butter and sugar together that's going to be the base of our cookie all right so i'm just going to scrape that down the sides and make sure that it gets good everything gets good and mixed up before i add my other ingredients so now i'm going to turn the mixture to low i'm going to add my egg yolk in there and let that good good mixed up so now with the mixer running on low what i'm going to add is the rest of the ingredients that has my oats in it my flour in it my baking soda my baking powder and my salt that's from the recipe so i'm going to go ahead and add these in there and i'm going to leave it on low until everything has been incorporated it just takes about a minute or so to get that get all that mixed up and after it looks like that i'm gonna stop it i'm just gonna you know stir around make sure everything is good all the dry ingredients are a little bit a little bit wet after i finish this i'm going to use a half sheet or if you're a quarter sheet you can use quarter sheet either use a parchment paper spray it with some pam or i love using these silpat mats [Music] if you haven't ever used them let me tell you it really really really does a great job and if you don't have any they make an amazing christmas present so ask for them for christmas stocking stuffers whatever you want to do easy you can find them pretty much anywhere online and um you'll love them they are great for cookies they're great for things like this all right that is pretty much mixed together but i highly recommend using the silpats so i'm going to clean this off make sure i get all that in there because you will need every single bit of it that you can get and i'm going to take my bowl away and we're just going to spread this out on this silpat and i'm going to bake it at 350 degrees about 15 minutes it'll puff up doesn't matter what shape it's in because after the cookie's done we're actually gonna put it into the food processor to make the pie crust so the biggest thing is just making sure you kind of get the right thickness so it's it's uniform all the way across because that way it will all cook at the same rate see if you have one side that's you know of course thinner than the other it's going to cook faster we don't want that we want it to cook about about the same so again 350 in the oven for about 15 minutes this is gonna puff up and uh we're gonna stick this in the oven we'll see you in just a minute okay so at this point our cookie has been baked and i'm going to tell you just a little okay a little hint something i do it's not in the recipe i make a double batch of the cookie reason is one it's a delicious oat cookie you just make it by yourself you'd be thrilled to let anybody be thrilled with this cookie number two when i spread my pie pans you know this is a very very very thin crust but sometimes i may just need just a little bit extra um to just fill up the tins and it gives me some of that so i can show you what the cookie looks like um this is what mine looks like i've already cut off the edges i will eat these probably later that family will and then i have the other that i'll use for the um pie crust one is doing okay that's got good and cool because the next steps i want to go ahead and make sure everything's ready but the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to show you how you make the crack pie aka milk pie filling now this has to be done with a stand mixer cannot be done with granny mix or can't be done with a hand mixer because it only takes it takes a really short time to put it together but you need that constant movement of it to get the smooth filling that we're going to use so also important thing this is the part of the recipe if you're thinking about making this number one look at the recipe number two because check the ingredients there's an ingredient in here that i was not familiar with and it's corn powder now i was thinking okay maybe corn starch maybe something like that but oh no come to find out this is actually freeze-dried corn that has been pulverized into a powder um this is what i found you can find it um online uh it's only place i found it there's nowhere in the stores around here maybe we'll be lucky and you'll have it somewhere near you this thing cannot be made without it it is uh one of the key ingredients it all is this this this recipe needs to be measured out to the exact gram but anyway back to the filling all my dry ingredients in the stand mixer includes the sugar the brown sugar the corn powder milk powder uh salt the um um yeah i think that's it that's it so i've got that in here i'm going to just use my mixer just for a quick minute just make sure it's all mixed together all those these dry ingredients are blended together now i've got some melted butter i also have eight egg yolks these yolks have to be all yolk there cannot be any white mixed in with it um if so this the pie doesn't turn out it's um quite finicky christine it's amazing that it turned out the way it is but it really is something that has to be done step by step i haven't even changed anything in this recipe okay so i've got that done i've got my melted butter i'm gonna go ahead and add that in just mix it just until everything is nice and um wet all the dry ingredients are no longer dry and now from here on out i'm gonna keep my mixer on low i'm gonna let that get good it's mixed up pretty well um looks like everything is a little bit at the bottoms working on it but it's getting there then i'm gonna add my heavy cream i'm gonna add my vanilla so i've got my uh heavy cream sitting out here actually i'm going to add the vanilla first a little bit of vanilla not a lot okay and now i'm going to add my heavy cream and i'm just going to mix let the evergreen mix until there's no more white streaks as you pour this in here you'll see the heavy cream there and you'll see it kind of will begin to mix together and um when all that is mixed up good then i'm gonna just kind of want to make sure everything mix if i need to scrape down the sides i can do that very carefully okay now at this point i'm gonna just scrape down the sides okay so now i've got that good mixed up i'm going to add my egg yolks in there and just mix it until it is just combined so i want to make sure that this does not get aerated so i'm keeping my mixer on low and i just want to mix it it's getting very glossy everything's getting mixed together that's perfect but i don't want to over mix it i don't want to mix it too fast because i don't want to aerate it okay so like i said it takes very short short amount of time to create this filling but the filling's done [Music] okay so here's the ball if your cookie if everything seems a little too dry to form this ball add another tablespoon or two of butter and you'll see it'll come right together so you really want to be able to do this because if not it's not going to be it's going to be too dry to really cover your your pans so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to split this i'm going to form the crust in both pans so i'll be able to use my my fingers and my palms my hands to spread this out and create the crust so the covers evenly covers the bottom and and most of the sides it may not come all the way to the top of the pie pan but that's fine get it do the best you can and um you know you want it this is you want it to be a thin thin crust so i'm going to spread these out and i will see you when i get finished doing that [Music] [Music] all right so we've got both we have the crust in both pans and now we're going to add the filling to both pie crust and then i'm going to put them on pans and then they're going to go into the oven now this has some baking instructions you have to follow them have some time related things so but first of all we're gonna get that filling in there and then we're gonna get them in the oven [Music] okay so i talked about the um instructions for the baking you really have to pay attention because you're baking at a certain temperature for 15 minutes then as instructions you actually open your oven door for a little while and reset the temperature to 325 let your oven cool down bake for another 5 or 10 minutes depending on how jiggly the middle of the of the pie is okay so we're there about to take these crack pies out of the oven now the center of these are going to be very jiggly and that's fine uh that's what we want that's exactly what you want to be as soon as i take these out of the oven i'm going to transfer them directly to the freezer you can let them come to room temperature and then freeze them but you have to freeze them for at least three hours so next time you see me after we check these out of the oven it's gonna be a few hours later let's see what these things look like oh yeah so the outside of it turned nice golden brown but the center still what you would consider not completely done but that's exactly what you want that gives it the amazing consistency that it's going to have so i'm going to take these pop them in the freezer see in a few hours later okay so here we are different shirt many hours later the pies have set beautifully they're just a little soft in the moon that's exactly what you want the pow doesn't set hard even though it's been in the freezer for hours to top these off because why not powdered sugar just a little bit and i just just to make them oh that much more like crack pie so that is how you make the milk bar pie a.k.a well that's it for another week so i hope you'll tune in for the next video which i'm not sure what we're going to do next but it's going to be something awesome and always remember please if you need more information on parkinson's there's going to be links down down in below in the description also a link to the recipe of this amazing dessert and to uh um so please

how to reduce harmful fats from your diet to reduce belly fat and help reverse diabetes hi guys my name is shaista zahirutin i am a registered dietitian and welcome to this series of how to prevent diabetes for the south asian population in north america in the last video i discussed how visceral fat which is a fat in our belly area can build up over time and cause insulin resistance which leads to a lot of diseases including diabetes polycystic ovarian syndrome metabolic syndrome and so many different diseases usually people even if they have a flat belly can have visceral fat because whistle fat is the hidden type of fat which is near our organs and when too much of that is built up then you start seeing belly fat so there are tools out there that can measure this i have a weighing scale i'll put the link to that in the description box below and basically it measures the amount of visceral fat in your body so let's talk about how food and nutrition can impact visceral fat research has shown that it's not only the amount of fat that we eat that can have an impact on insulin resistance but it also depends on the quality of the fat there are two types of fats that are very harmful for health one is known as trans fats and the other is known as saturated fats now what is trans fat trans fat is when liquid fats and oils are converted to solid fats by a chemical process this fat is very very harmful for our body and this will lead to insulin resistance some of the foods that have trans fat include things that are processed mostly things that you buy from a supermarket especially pastries and cakes so if you think about margarine or i can't believe it's not butter these are liquid oils that have been converted to solid fats there are actually margarines out there which are made with non-hydrogenated that's the key word you're looking for non-hydrogenated margarines and these have very little to almost no trans fats so those would be better if you are someone who already eats margarine then go for non-hydrogenated margarines other foods that have a lot of trans fats in them are a lot of desi snacks so things like chirwa and kara a lot of them have a little bit of trans fat in them so my recommendation to you is look in your pantry look at the food label make sure you see the portion size or the serving size that this label is about and go and look at the total fat and just below it there is trans fat this should be zero if you have anything that is above 0.5 grams of trans fat i recommend throw them out okay if you can't throw them out or if you feel that it's not an option for you then make sure you have them no more than one time per month and it should be the exact portion that's on the label or even less at that event in u.s if there is less than 0.5 gram of trans fat it is okay for them to label it as zero trans fat so remember even though a lot of foods might say zero transfer there still might be just a little bit there so be careful not to go above the recommended portion size now other foods that have a lot of harmful kinds of fat are processed meats and by processed meat i'm talking about hot dogs sausages salamis pepperoni for some people this is their everyday lunch but these foods are very high in saturated fat and very high in trans fat and sodium there is a direct link of processed meats with colon cancer so it is best to start reducing your processed meat intake in your diet whether it's from a turkey or a chicken or even red meat it doesn't matter any processed meat is harmful and it is recommended to limit them to no more than one time a month if you habitually have processed meats or deli meats every day or every alternate day in the week then try to reduce it to one time a week but your goal should be to limit it to one time or less per month in order to prevent belly fat increase and the visceral fat and reversing diabetes now the second type of fat that is really harmful for you is saturated fat now saturated fat is very common in a lot of our foods some of the biggest sources of saturated fat is fatty meats high fat dairy products processed foods like i mentioned before and some oils which i'll talk in another video now research suggests that having a lot of saturated fat in your diet can and will lead to increased belly fat increase inflammation increase cholesterol and diabetes and heart attacks so that means that we need to start reducing saturated fats in our diet and but the goal is not like trans fat trans fat is the worst think about the traffic lights so red is stop you don't want any trans fats and then the yellow light is the saturated fat you want a little bit but very little and then there are the green fats where you can have a little bit more obviously the portions should be controlled based on the health authorities in u.s and in canada we want to reduce your saturated fat intake to about five percent of your total calories maximum if you are an average person who has a 1500 calorie diet for men and 1200 calorie diet for women for example then your limit is about eight grams of saturated fat in one day and for women it's about six grams of saturated fat so between six and eight grams of saturated fat is allowed and it's considered a healthy balance but any more than that can have harmful effects on our body so some of the known saturated fats are from the skins of meats so the skin of chicken for example or turkey all the visible fat that you can see on your meats and your red meats should be removed because those are essentially where all the saturated fat is there is some saturated fat hidden inside the tissue of the muscle of the animal but the most common ones are the visible fat so you want to completely remove them if some of your recipes call for having fat or skin of chicken limit that again to know more than one time per month so if you are making pie or nihari or bone broth or you're making rotisserie chicken limit that to one time a month that way you are reducing the saturated fat reducing the belly fat and the insulin resistance that can result from that the next thing that you have to remember is that red meats have a lot more saturated fat than white meats so your red meats like your lamb and your beef have between six to eight grams of saturated fat in a small single portion about half a cup or just a palm size that is the maximum amount of your daily requirement of saturated fat then what do you do about other food products that have some saturated fat in it oils have saturated fat and then um dairy products your milk will have such there are a lot of foods that have naturally a little bit of saturated fat in them so if you max your budget on just red meat then you have nothing else that you can eat in the day you can't eat nuts you can't eat seeds all these foods that are healthy for you that is why it's recommended that you reduce your red meats to less than one time a week and then you have things like chicken and fish which are known as white meats these have between one to three grams of saturated fat for the same serving of our red meat so that means that you have a little bit more room for other healthy foods so that your total amount can come to between six to eight grams now on a side note i wanted to talk a little bit about reducing meats in your diet this includes meats from chicken or red meats it doesn't matter the fact is that our ancestors have never eaten so much meat as much as we're eating today you know back when we used to be farmers and our ancestors and our grandparents their farm animals were mostly used for protection for grazing for wool maybe for milk and for other uses for plowing their fields a lot of the animals in the farms are used mostly for other uses and not so much for meat and it takes about one and a half to two years for an animal to mature before it might be used for meats so animals in the farms were hardly slaughtered for meats maybe a couple times a month or maybe a couple times a week depending on how many animals they had that means that we've never ever eaten so much meat before as much as we're eating today i believe most of our non-veg desi population are eating meat almost every day and i'm not far from this my family eats meat every single day every single meal which is which is sad but it does become our lifestyle we have a lot of meat coming in but this has had never been the case for our bodies before this is why our bodies don't know how to react to so much meat and meat has always traditionally been used for celebrations or for feasts sometimes when there are big gatherings or some guests come over then an animal has been slaughtered but they had never eaten meat on a regular basis so when it comes to meal planning for diabetes prevention i recommend try to eat at least one meatless meal every day of the week this will get you started on experimenting with different kinds of legumes and different kind of recipes where meat doesn't have to be the center of attention generally a diabetes prevention diet would include at least three to five days that are meatless but for starting i say if you can maintain one meatless meal for one entire month that is an excellent progress towards prevention of diabetes now what i would suggest in the following month is try to increase that to about two meatless days in your week now what can you have on the other days of the week i suggest if you can limit your red meats at least start with two days a week of red meats so if you are someone who eats lamb or goat or beef very often then reduce that to at least two days a week so we have one day me class we have two days of red meat i would also recommend having fish once every week now you must be wondering why fish so going back to our ancestors most of civilizations have started near water if you think of any civilization whether it be egyptian indian european any society had always been established where there's water and the reason for that is first water of course but also the sea creatures in the water fish may be the only food that had been eaten from probably beginning of time and fish has so so many benefits that we are not getting enough of from my experience most south asians hardly eat fish even once a month there are some obviously geographically if they are close to water that they have high fish in taking their diet but most south asians especially north america are void of fish in their diet fish has healthy fats which actually compete and replace harmful fats they have also anti-inflammatory power so basically having more fish in your diet improves your immune system so you can fight off anything your body doesn't need and therefore fight off insulin resistance and it's excellent for brain health for improvement of memory and for prevention of alzheimer's even so there are a lot of benefits that fish have and i can't cover all of that in today's session but my point to you is having fish at least once a week will get you started on improving your chances of reversing diabetes so when it comes to meal planning one meatless day two red meats if you're regularly eating red meat one fish day a week and the remaining days you can decide if you want to have chicken or something else eventually in a month or two i would like you to progress to having two meatless days and two days for fish and one red meat day and two days for chicken and this goal is a very very good goal to stick to you can keep this for at least three or four months or even half a year or a year if you can keep that you're still on the good place but if you want to move to the next level the best meal plan would be having meatless meals three to four times a week two fish in a week one or two days for chicken and zero or one day for red meats and this if you can maintain for the rest of your life you are on a good track of prevention and even management of a lot of diseases so to conclude my take home message to you is today first of all go and look at the food labels on your pantry and in your fridge to look for any foods that have any trans fat in them and make sure if you have even 0.5 grams of trans fat in that food put them out and then try to figure out how you can replace them if you don't know how you can replace them put in the comments below and i will give you suggestions second thing look up recipes for fish and meatless meals now there is a website called meatless mondays which actually has a lot of meatless recipes that you can try when you're getting started go ahead do your best i'll come back next week with another video of how to prevent diabetes and one more note if you want meal plans and if you can't wait till next week for another video i have made a few meal plans that you can download and start using right away and those will be linked in the description box below have a great day and see you next week", "vgkkbZRBj68": "hi everyone welcome to phone phones kitchen i'm fun fun i am a phd student at studies my university department planning and regional

or eight minutes thank you for watching see you in next video bye", "yqJVlHzuZkQ": "in this video i'm going to cover how to calculate carbs and why it matters my name is nina i'm a certified personal trainer strength and conditioning coach i also have a certification in fitness nutrition and i am an author of four books so let's go right to it the reason why you want to know how to calculate net carbs is because you want to know how many carbohydrates you're consuming so there's something called gross carbohydrates also known as total carbohydrates so that is what you will see on a package but that doesn't really matter because what you want to know is how many carbohydrates you're actually absorbing how many carbohydrates you're consuming that is the amount that's going to spike your blood sugar now this is really really important if you're a diabetic especially if you're a diabetic on medication if you're on insulin or any type of aura medication so if you are counting carbs which you should be doing as a diabetic you definitely want to know how to calculate your gross and nut carbohydrates so if you are on insulin and you're trying to calculate how much insulin to take it's really really important to do the math so i'm going to help you show you how to do that right now so let's take some common ingredients that people eat so one is quinoa quinoa is a whole healthy grain and this package that i'm showing you here i got this bag from costco it is organic quinoa you want to get as much food certified organic if you're in the united states that just means that you shouldn't be having any pesticides because that's not something that you want to consume it's very harmful for our bodies so in this package the quinoa is 180 calories for a quarter of a cup you're thinking what that's crazy but once you cook the quinoa that quarter cup of dry quinoa will be more like a half a cup so that half a cup of quinoa total carbohydrates is 34 grams but remember you take the 34 grams of total carbohydrates you subtract the 4 grams of fiber and that means you're getting 30 grams of carbohydrates now this is actually not a lot people eat a lot more carbohydrates than 30 grams people might you'll say oh my gosh well chocolate bar is 30 grams of carbohydrates yes but people eat way more than that usually like 60 to 75 with a meal sometimes even more depending on if you're going out to eat if you're eating pizza or pasta okay let's go also now let's talk about oats so right here i've got organic dry toasted oats a half a cup is 150 calories so that's typical if you're thinking about how do i calculate carbs you don't always have nutritional information on hand especially if you're going out to eat so a good rule of thumb is a half a cup of any type of grain it's typically around 30 grams of gross carbohydrates and sometimes even net but if it depends on how well it's packed so and this box the total carbohydrates is 27 grams the dietary fiber is four grams and that equals 23 net carbohydrates in this bag of tortilla chips 10 tortilla chips is 130 calories who stops at 10 chips but anyways total carbohydrates is 17 grams it has 2 grams of fiber so it equals 15 net grams but notice this also has oil in it so oil tends to increase their cholesterol levels and and also can increase your blood sugar levels so that's another reason why you want to always focus on whole foods things that are not processed that you can get from a bag that has a whole bunch of dish additional ingredients so you want to aim for about 25 grams of fiber per day that's actually the minimum and as you can see from these few ingredients those aren't high in fiber so why do you want fiber well fiber is think about it like a broom it cleans out all the gunk it aids in weight loss it makes your gut microbiome healthier and it helps lower cholesterol and reduces your chance of cancer while blood sugar is something that diabetics have to pay close attention to it's also important for anyone else who doesn't have diabetes to pay attention to so you don't want to have a diet that's extremely high in carbohydrates you want to balance it with protein and greens healthy foods whole foods so if you like this video let me know i've got some really exciting videos that i'm excited about that's coming up in january i'm going to post a video on how to lose weight

i'll see you soon", "X3824XkQwlo": "hey guys okay so today I'm going to show you how to make some creamy pecan pralines so I've never made this recipe before but it looks pretty simple but it also looks a little tricky make sure you get the right consistency but we look a bit a shot and I'm no expert never said I was so I'll just try and see how it goes but yeah so I'll stop rambling and like always make sure you guys like and subscribe and comment below and share the video and I will see you guys in a couple seconds alrighty guys so what we're gonna do is we're gonna grab a small saucepan and we're gonna add some ingredients to this so the first thing that we're gonna add is going to be four tablespoons of unsalted butter and we will be using five tablespoons all together in this recipe but we only want four right now so four tablespoons is going to be folks 60 grams alrighty so there's our four tablespoons of unsalted butter the next thing that we're gonna add is going to be so the recipe calls for a third of a cup of trim healthy mama gentle sweet obviously I don't have that you can make your own blend if you want I'm just gonna be using 1/3 of a cup of swerve cuz that's all I have and I'm using confectioner's of course all righty so there's our sweetener and then the last thing that we'll add for now is going to be 6 tablespoons of light cream it says I'm gonna use heavy cream so we'll see how that goes so I'm gonna be needing 90 grams per milliliters rather so there's our cream so what we're gonna do with this now is we're gonna take it over to the stove and we're gonna heat this over medium heat and we're basically gonna stir it until the sweetener is dissolved so let me get that going and I will meet you guys there all righty guys so here is my mixture butter is completely melted the sweetener I can't really tell if it's been dissolved or not just because it is confectioner's already but it looks pretty good to me I only took a few minutes at medium heat so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna I guess some one more ingredient before we get this going so the next thing we're gonna add to this is going to be a quarter of a teaspoon vanilla extract so I trade you the vanilla but it's already gone this is just starting to bubble up so we're just gonna obviously stir that in and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna cook this until we get a deep golden brown color and it's basically we won't it right the pork burns which obviously it's hard to tell I've read some reviews like comments that you know a lot of people think you need candy thermometer to get this right but we're gonna give it a try so once it's a nice deep golden brown we're gonna remove it from the heat and make sure you have your one tablespoon of butter handy because we're gonna stick that in as soon as we do all that I'm not sure if you're supposed to stir it right now I am just cuz I don't want it to burn but it's nicely I don't know if you guys can see that it's kind of lightly boiling simmering and I'm hoping it turns out with a sweetener I used the blend that author uses she uses like a retort all xylitol stevia blend so I'm hoping same thing will happen like I hope I get the same similar results I'm gonna say this smells really good right now so I'm gonna let this go and then I will show you guys what mine looks like right after I take it off the heat and stick my 1 tablespoon of butter and we'll see we'll see but yeah when this is done I will show you guys see you in a bit alrighty guys so I just removed it from the heat and I put 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in here so I'm just stirring it in it's not really that dark or a deep golden brown the reason why I took it off the heat was because it sounded like it was burning every time I start it so yeah ok so now what we're gonna do is yeah so you want to stir everything until it's nice and smooth which mine definitely is nice and smooth no lumps so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a pinch of salt it's gonna use some pink Himalayan just a half a turn and them are also I guess our main ingredient here is we're gonna add our toasted pecans so you want to add one cup I used 100 grams of pecan halves I'm just using the great value bread and you want to roast them in the oven for about 5 10 minutes depending on your oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until basically they start smelling really good and they're lightly browned so yeah I'm gonna add mine are already done obviously so we're gonna add these they're everything together so yeah that's my mixture so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna get some kind of if you want to use like a cookie sheet whatever you line it with wax paper and we're basically gonna drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the wax paper and then we're gonna refrigerate it until it's firm so hopefully I did it right if not I bribe people and using this as like Stoppers for like keto ice cream stuff like that so not gonna waste it cuz it's still gonna be pretty yummy I'm sure so let me drop some of these on my wax paper and then I'll show you guys what might look like before I stick them in the fridge alrighty guys so here are mine the recipe says it makes 12 I made 15 not a big deal it really depends on you know how many calories you want each cluster to be and it's a little hard I mean trying to get each one even right so yeah uh it actually does seem like it's kind of solidifying a bit so yeah I'm gonna stick these in the refrigerator and hope that they actually so little find properly and then I will be back with you guys in a little bit once they maybe in an hour to hopefully you know by then I'll know and then I'll actually try one so wish me luck and I II will see you guys in a bit hey guys okay so it's been about an hour or so and mine have like a hardened up there a little sticky but like when I peel them off the wax paper but they're not that bad I haven't tried them though but so here they are I took a thumbnail alright so yeah kind of what they look like so I'm gonna try one obviously okay so you know they're really good they're really sweet which isn't a bad thing toasting the pecans I didn't really realize how differently they taste and just like raw I guess hope you cans but they're pretty good so yeah these are really good and I believe they're around 100 110 calories per since I made mine in 215 servings and of course it'll be a little off because I didn't measure everything precisely but whatever I'll probably be the one eating these anyway so it doesn't matter but yeah so they're really good and I don't think I messed them up too bad so you can reflect I don't know but yeah so I will stop rambling and I will put the nutrition on the screen here per one serving out of the 15 remember you can make them 12 to 4 servings 20 servings whatever you guys want I did 15 so yeah and very low carbs always a good thing when that's high carbs a low I want to thank you guys for watching and yeah like always make sure you like and subscribe and comment below and share the video and I will see you guys in the next one", "wVa8CJvAUUM": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today is Saturday June 6th and I'm going to walk you through my entire day and I feel a little bit different than before also I brought you out the door so I'm like really out of breath and I like split my lip so sorry no totally um yeah today's a little different because it is a refeed day so I get to eat more carbs but that I have to eat less fat and I love chocolate so Scott was fat and all yeah so we're gonna run out the door I didn't eat breakfast so I'm really hungry so I'm gonna eat like half of this protein bar that I had left and um yeah alright Kappa oh thank you hey guys this is my mom name is Shari we are out and about running errands we are going to go to Starbucks and and Costco and then one burn so yeah it's a hot day at Maryland and [Music] all right guys just got home from Costco and Walmart and I just let the dogs out we already sunbathing Tucker hasn't peed yet today so yeah maybe he'll go pee it looks like he's going to be up that poop you don't need to see that here's a low key there was no toilet paper at Costco so mom gave me a couple packs which is great so yeah I have a lot to unload I did this will probably last us for a whole month like snack wise so yeah that's Walmart and then I got a lot of good stuff from Costco also got these pans really excited because I was cooking eggs in like a huge pan and it just didn't make sense so yeah so I'm gonna get to learning salt workout today well I've had to eat is a protein bar and a banana and a Starbucks coffee so probably gonna eat a lot of food before I work out cuz I'm really tired and I'm headache hello-o alright so just do a quick little haul I absolutely adore top corners they had just really good macros and they're really delicious hausen I really like to get these pizzas from Costco again macros are good I can have half a pizza with fat-free cheese and that's just like I can just fit it in and it's great and it's kind of better and less greasy than a regular pizza so those are great cereal for knives and I also put it on top of my protein ice cream it's just it's good I like it it's you know got all into it it's great these simple mills are really good macros awesome as well a little bit on protein but you don't really expect much out of crackers and you can have a decent amount so teen crackers so yeah it's got those to try out again I'm vegetarian so having something quick just to grab for some extra protein is always a good option for me I really wanted to try these I've had them before but they had like the chocolate things on the bottom so gonna miss the chocolate part but they just seemed like a quick little thing to grab would you leave the cat alone leave vanilla we've kissed we just hit okay sit for me okay anyway I thought these before but not the jalapeno kind so I'm really excited to try them at Costco had them yeah I usually have about like 17 pieces so it's not all of this fat yeah so it's kind of a lot of fat for chips but it's okay only have 17 oh I got these for NAS for his lunches so that's just quick and easy just throw the lunch these Robins are awesome I haven't had them since counting macros but again of course it's pasta so it's gonna be Carvey but that's great and then I just put in some vegetable broth and some veggies and we're good to go I got these I've never had the spaghetti version but it's red lentil so it's got a good amount of protein again anywhere I can get protein as a vegetarian is really good option since I love muscle I saw somebody on Instagram eating these with some Nutella and that made me get really excited I totally threw out decided to tell her that I honestly can't buy the ones from Costco because they're so big here's some coffee I just need more coffee I love getting full beans because they just I don't know full beans just tastes better because you grind them as you want to eat them garden them as you want to make coffee and when you get it from the actual location it's just better and it helps these people so anyway um now that I can eat these like really quickly obviously their car be that not that bad I don't know their halos so they're nice especially for summertime these before delicious and some peanut butter I like to get the organic you dip to stir it but it levels out pretty nicely and I can give this to the dogs too and not be worried that there's anything bad in it so yeah that is Costco I also got the pans oh and I got some salted nuts and they I usually have like a couple here and there when I'm really craving salt obviously they're a lot of fat yeah there's no reason you need to eat that many so anyway sauce to make our own homemade pizzas I've made one cuz I had like the least randomly in my house and I can't find used anywhere I can't find out far all right quickly because I'm hungry and I need to put this away some sugar-free jell-o I want to try out macros pretty good that is always what I'm looking for and there it's really not that bad at all so it'd be a nice little dessert three Greek yogurts nonfat Greek yogurt it's because I go through these like crazy they're great source of protein I wanted to make some ice cream sandwiches but with Cool Whip so I'm gonna try that out egg whites this is for litter boxes and then I got this for the couch because I have a lot of handles so baby switch this they're supposed to be barbecue but cheddar here might be cool again Packers are not that bad so the kind of almond milk I get I also drink the fair life fat-free when I can again it's expensive so can't always support that fat-free cheese I've put this on like both my likes lunch and dinner meals I got some lemons of limes because I have been putting water enhancers in my water and sometimes I just the artificial taste I just can't stand it so I'm gonna try to do the natural way some protein bars just to grab and go on days like today when I literally these are oh I did not mean to get chocolate chip hmm I feel like that was a mistake it's a fortunate mistake cuz obsolete definite there's a little high in fat but just one of the mornings okay running out vegetables I love stir-fry mixes they just everything's delicious and other vegetables if I didn't order these ahead of time at Walmart I would have just gotten them from Costco but I didn't know I was gonna say these are for NASA I put them in his lunch and then also for whatever he wants chocolate I do have dark chocolate in there which he doesn't like so I'll do those and everybody's happy this is a lot smaller than I thought might be that's the only thing about ordering ahead at Walmart you just like don't know what you're gonna get but yeah as like to have this as a dessert like chocolate milk on the milk of course was you're both lactose intolerant but sometimes we ignore that this is the enchilada sauce that I use for my casserole I wanted to get by sea oats medium sweet yeah the last one I got was not and was really boring sorry but I love spicy stuff I want to try these protein bars because I love lemon yeah they just looked really good and honestly that's great carbs protein so definitely great and I ran out of rice so I need to get more of that my mom gave me some pears and some walnuts and then these are like protein bars that she didn't like they're like called pink bars so yeah I'm absolutely exhausted and sweating and I need to eat something so [Music] it is 301 and I'm just now eating again I haven't eaten since protein bar this morning so I put together this little bowl of spot I would have put more potatoes in it but I don't have any cooked as I can eat more cards so it's got 2.6 ounces of potatoes 2 ounces of beyond meat that it has like 170 grams of just like mixed vegetables and then I put a little bit of sriracha a little bit of ketchup I don't track that cuz like why would you do that and then I put some anything but the bagel seasoning so I'm gonna eat that a lot of water it's bad scold me and probably cleaning the rest of my house because yeah right [Music] honestly not sure if it'd work out it's gonna happen today you are supposed to work out when you have a refeed day but I've been pretty active I took Leah for a walk I've been all over running errands again I saw the same as like a lifting workout now they're gonna go for our Sunday walk tomorrow and then we're also I could just double up in the basement with our body and lower body so that's my excuse if I don't workout today because maybe you want I'll feel better once I eat out [Music] and I'm starving for because I just get something in my stomach so I get other things done so I just got dishes clean and now I was able to wash my new little pan so that I can make some eggs I'm also gonna make some rice I'm gonna make 2 cups worth of dry rice and then I'll be able to have it throughout the rest of the week and yeah so right now my plan is to just do egg whites and rice and maybe some veggies this is what happens I don't plan I also had one of these they're really yummy they're dangerous if I was not counting macros I'd probably eat like 20 of them with some milk yeah [Music] what [Music] okay let's make some rice [Music] alright grace by heating it up like a medium level and I once it starts bubbling and you turn it down to like the two or three lid on and then you just kind of keep an eye on it and then once the water is gone take it off and stir it up great and jasmine rice it's like sticky rice like even when you reheat it it's like the most magical thing and it's got good nutrients in it for the longest time I thought you had to have brown rice but that I don't know brown rice is disgusting to me so this stuff we're good to go all right while I wait for this to cook I'm going to have protein shake because I ring for it you guys have seen me make this before it's just a berry I use this blend from Costco I put a cup in there I do a cup of the fair life because it gets me 13 grams of protein and two scoops of vanilla protein powder I don't usually use this one anymore but I had some left it's great because it doesn't have any like crap in it like sucralose or fake sugar which is what suger this is and the only thing is it just it has so like has a lot of carbs that's a lot and you need two scoops instead of one so I just feel like it's I don't know so another good thing to put in here is a little bit of a frozen banana which I'll probably do and then some ice and then blend it up it's great all right guys it is now 5:30 just finishing my protein shake and I'm having 150 grams of jasmine rice 75 grams of egg whites 28 grams of mozzarella fat-free cheese and then 83 grams of 85 grams frozen vegetables and then just some sriracha sauce cos everything needs to be spicy and I got this today at Costco so put one of them in the oven right now so that's bacon away you can see my giant slice of just cheese so macro eyes I don't have room I mean I could but I would be done with carbs and I don't want to be done with carbs today so I can have a quarter of the pizza this kit is like really awesome because it comes with a packet a pre-measured sauce it does not come with cheese though so I added my own cheese measured it out and put it on the corner of the pizza and then now skits pepperonis because delicious but as meat so you know what's great about this is it comes with this like other bags to put the rest of the pizza crusts in I just say think of everything so I think that's awesome anyway he thought coming soon it only takes 8 minutes to cook like what the heck [Music] not very healthy but it fits our macro so I'm gonna eat it so that's the pizza these are the Ritz and this is 15 grams but so this is what those are I tried the barbecue I really like the barbecue but they substituted these this time and a cheddar it's not that bad they have a lot of flavor and they're really light and airy and I did use the water enhancer thing instead of lemon just cuz it was just easier but tomorrow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys it's the next day and that was a really weird day evening that's not very normal of me I'm usually either consistently throughout the day and that was rough I had a really bad headache so that's what happens we don't plan when you need to eat macros because I was doing errands and I very well could have stopped into like chick-fil-a or something I got salad and you know it's just if you plan better you will have better results and I grabbed hey anyway thank you so

I've only made alcoholic drinks on two previous\u00a0\noccasions. The first time was when I made my Irish\u00a0\u00a0 coffee keto and sugar-free video, in which I use\u00a0\nthe same Irish whiskey I'm going to be using in\u00a0\u00a0 this recipe, today. The second alcoholic beverage\u00a0\nI made was version 2 of my creamy eggnog recipe,\u00a0\u00a0 which was a cooked eggnog, not a raw eggnog. In\u00a0\nthe eggnog recipe, I added a tasty spiced rum,\u00a0\u00a0 for the adult version. So, today I'm going to show\u00a0\nyou how to make my third alcoholic drink, which\u00a0\u00a0 is an acceptable and keto neutral sugar-free\u00a0\nBaileys Irish Cream, my version. I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 make a big bottle, or one liter, because I have\u00a0\nseveral more special recipes to share with you,\u00a0\u00a0 and each of the next few recipes will be using the\u00a0\nsugar-free Baileys Irish cream as an ingredient,\u00a0\u00a0 including the video I will be posting to celebrate\u00a0\nour fourth anniversary of this channel, and which\u00a0\u00a0 coincides with my birthday. As well, since I've been\u00a0\non keto, I rarely drink alcohol, but I have three\u00a0\u00a0 eager taste testers who'll be helping me out and\u00a0\nexpressing their opinions at the end of the video.\u00a0\u00a0 So, please join us for toast,\u00a0\nand their opinion at the end. Before continuing, I'd like to mention that\u00a0\nthere are certain types of alcohol that are\u00a0\u00a0 acceptable on the keto diet or a low carb\u00a0\ndiet. They won't kick you out of ketosis, but\u00a0\u00a0 they will put you in a pause state. And, remember\u00a0\nthat alcohol will affect you much more strongly,\u00a0\u00a0 if you're on keto or low carb, than if\u00a0\nyou're eating a carbohydrate-rich diet.\u00a0\u00a0 You will notice that you will feel the effects\u00a0\nmuch more quickly and on much less alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0 And, I'd also like to caution you that, for some\u00a0\npeople, even just a little bit of alcohol will\u00a0\u00a0 result in a hangover. In other words, your\u00a0\ntolerance to alcohol is greatly reduced.\u00a0\u00a0 So, if you drink alcohol to celebrate, or socially,\u00a0\nalways drink in moderation, and also stay\u00a0\u00a0 very hydrated. Spirits such as whiskey usually\u00a0\nhave zero or almost zero carbs and, as a result,\u00a0\u00a0 here's the macronutrient ratio for my sugar-free\u00a0\nBaileys Irish cream. The ratio is 15.7 to 1 with\u00a0\u00a0 0.8 grams of total carbs and net carbs, since\u00a0\nthere's no dietary fiber in this recipe. Here\u00a0\u00a0 are the ingredients I will be using to make\u00a0\nmy version of this creamy alcoholic beverage.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many versions of Baileys on\u00a0\nthe internet, and some are even keto, but\u00a0\u00a0 I wasn't quite happy with them. So, in this recipe,\u00a0\nI begin by making a fresh batch of my sugar-free\u00a0\u00a0 sweetened condensed milk. And, once you've made\u00a0\nthe sugar-free sweetened condensed milk, set\u00a0\u00a0 it aside and let it get to room temperature. Next,\u00a0\nmake the full batch of my Parisian hot chocolate\u00a0\u00a0 and, once that's made, set it aside. Let the hot\u00a0\nchocolate cool to room temperature. As well, you\u00a0\u00a0 can take shortcuts, but this is not a cheap recipe\u00a0\nto make and you really want it to be as close to\u00a0\u00a0 the original as possible, so please do use the\u00a0\ntwo ingredients that you have to do a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of prep with. You will be very glad you did. You may\u00a0\nbe wondering \"maybe I could take a shortcut and use\u00a0\u00a0 one of the pre-made chocolate syrups. Although they\u00a0\nmay be keto, they really don't taste quite right.\u00a0\u00a0 I'd also like to mention that you'll only be\u00a0\nusing about two tablespoons of the Parisian hot\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, but you can save the rest of the syrup,\u00a0\nor even freeze it, for the next few videos that you\u00a0\u00a0 will also need this ingredient for. Because, if you\u00a0\nlike this Bailey's recipe, you will absolutely love\u00a0\u00a0 my next two videos, especially the one on February\u00a0\n28th. Okay, once these two ingredients are prepared\u00a0\u00a0 and cooled to room temperature, the rest of the\u00a0\nrecipe is extremely easy to make. Begin by getting\u00a0\u00a0 your large mixing bowl, into which you pour in\u00a0\nyour room temperature, strong espresso coffee.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, I poured in my sugar-free sweetened condensed\u00a0\nmilk and the room temperature heavy whipping cream. Now it's time to also add the\u00a0\nParisian hot chocolate sauce.\u00a0\u00a0 Next, I add the vanilla, but always try to get the\u00a0\nbest quality vanilla you can get, because a good\u00a0\u00a0 vanilla will enhance the flavor. At this point,\u00a0\nI'd like to thank my dear friend Belize guy\u00a0\u00a0 for sending me this wonderful bottle of vanilla.\u00a0\nAnd then, add the almond extract. Surprisingly, this\u00a0\u00a0 ingredient is needed, so don't omit it. Now, use a\u00a0\nwhisk to gently mix the ingredients, without adding\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of air, until all the ingredients are well\u00a0\ncombined and the liquid has a homogeneous color.\u00a0\u00a0 Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to mention you have to\u00a0\nadd the almond milk in, as well. Lastly, drizzle in\u00a0\u00a0 the Irish whiskey and again gently whisk to make\u00a0\nsure that all the ingredients are well combined.\u00a0\u00a0 I wish that you could smell the aroma\u00a0\nemanating from my bowl as I'm whisking. And, we're all done. That's all there\u00a0\nis to making my sugar-free Baileys\u00a0 Irish Cream. The best way to store this, which\u00a0\nwill result in the least alcohol evaporation,\u00a0\u00a0 I have found that it's best to decant into\u00a0\na bottle with an airtight lid, like this. You\u00a0\u00a0 can buy a one liter bottle, like the one I'm\u00a0\nusing, at most dollar stores. A one liter bottle,\u00a0\u00a0 similar to the one that I'm using, only costs\u00a0\nthree dollars and fifty cents at our local store. My bottle is just slightly under a\u00a0\nliter, so I'm actually going to have a\u00a0\u00a0 little extra, which I'm going to pour into\u00a0\nmy mason jar. All that is left to do is to\u00a0\u00a0 refrigerate the bottle until the Baileys is nice\u00a0\nand cool. You'll find that it's best to serve this\u00a0\u00a0 sugar-free Baileys Irish cream when it's nice and\u00a0\nchilled. There's many ways to enjoy the Baileys\u00a0\u00a0 Irish Cream, like in a shot or over ice, but in\u00a0\nbetween uses always store your Irish cream in\u00a0\u00a0 your refrigerator, since it's using quite a lot of\u00a0\ncream which, by the way, will last several months, or\u00a0\u00a0 until you drink it. I would like to suggest, before\u00a0\npouring a shot, always shake the bottle first\u00a0\u00a0 because some of the heavier ingredients\u00a0\nwill drift to the bottom of the bottle.\u00a0\u00a0 And now, I'd like to have my taste testers give\u00a0\ntheir comments and opinions. I would like each\u00a0\u00a0 of you to give your honest evaluation as to the\u00a0\ntaste, and how closely you think this tastes to\u00a0\u00a0 the original Bailey's Irish cream. Sl\u00e1inte!\nIt's been a long time, but to the best of my\u00a0\u00a0 recollection this tastes like the original. It's\u00a0\nsmooth, creamy and chocolatey. As my mom said, your\u00a0\u00a0 tolerance is way down on keto, so it hits you a\u00a0\nlot harder, but I can confirm that this tastes\u00a0\u00a0 exactly like the regular Baileys. It's delicious,\u00a0\nsmooth and creamy, and it's just absolutely perfect. I never really cared for Baileys in the past,\u00a0\nbut man do I want more of this. Thank you very\u00a0\u00a0 much for watching my video and I hope that you\u00a0\nfound this recipe interesting and useful. If\u00a0\u00a0 you're new to my channel, welcome, and just to let\u00a0\nyou know, the link for the written recipe, as well\u00a0\u00a0 as the link for the videos I've mentioned,\u00a0\nare all posted

Laura starting from the very beginning come join round my challenge let's go hi everyone my name is Rita and welcome to the 78th day of my challenge where after having a fair share of pies I feel it's time for some muffins right and what I know I have a muffin recipe in the line and these muffins my friends will be so awesome because they are a union of banana bread and chocolate chip muffins can you feel how good they will be so before i get into the ingredients I feel I have to warn you you're about to see some quite an appealing looking bananas and there are a couple of reasons for that the first one being I keep them in the fridge otherwise they spoil really quickly like in two days or so don't ask me how I know that and as I keep them in the fridge they get darker quite sooner because of the cold and the next thing which is more related to the recipe is you want to use really ripe bananas for baking and how can you tell what it's really right oh well when you see a banana and you're not tempted to take it a needle on your own because of how it looks that means it's perfect for making so that being said let's go over the ingredients and let's get started we're gonna need 230 grams of flour 100 grams of sugar 100 grams of vegetable oil 2 eggs 3 right bananas 1 teaspoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda quarter of a teaspoon of salt water with a spoon of cinnamon quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 150 grams of chocolate chips I'm going to start by lining the cupcake tin with the liners and as it seems that this dough will come together really quickly I'm going to turn on my oven to preheat to 200 degrees from the very beginning and now the dough and I'm going to start with these pretty-looking bananas which I'm gonna mash quite well ok and now i'm gonna add in vegetable oil when the legs checked and the eggs and mix everything together and the sugar and I wanna mixed more value seats incorporated okay for now I'm gonna take three tablespoons out from the flour and mix together with the chocolate chips and I'm going to mix in all the spices baking powder baking soda salt and cinnamon into the flour I'm gonna mix in the flour mixture and I'm going to fold in the flour coated chocolate chips and by the way we did this way so that the chocolate chips would distribute throughout the muffin evenly to gain that's done it's quicker than quick I'm so surprised you never want to over make such things so that you wouldn't lose the fluffiness and likeness of muffins and cookies and now the only thing that's left to do is this distribute the batter evenly among the liners and I'm gonna use the big ice cream scoop to help you with that oh wow look how much more i have i think i'm just going to distribute it evenly I just wanted to say not a drop of batter wasted but the very seat oh well I did a great job at making a mess today anyways now into the oven for 18 minutes ok so I've used even three toothpicks and I think I should put them for a couple more minutes because there are still a tiny bit of crumbs left ok so 20 minutes did it and I'm gonna let them cool a tiny bit before trying oh my goodness this is crazy they look like chocolate chip muffins but they smell like a banana bread oh my hoe smells so nice and the other thing okay which one to take the other thing this is ridiculous they look like in some cafe like when you go and see the stand these perfect-looking muffins and cupcakes this looks exactly like that did I make them pick it up okay wait I've learned my fair share of making a mess I I want to try it so that I love warm this bakery goods like bread cupcakes cookies I know it's not really healthy to eat them while they're still warm but oh my God look seriously it looks like a chocolate chip muffin but oh my goodness I was rapping this is so light so fluffy so banana cookie so now i have two recipes for not wasting any bananas I used to every single time big banana bread because my husband loves it so much then he's buying crazy amounts of bananas but now I have another recipe and I think even if I don't use the chocolate chips or I used less of them it will still be so good Oh about this recipe cannot even tell you so you want go and check the original recipe by Laura there the written one is in the description box the only thing i'm sad now about is that you might not have bananas at this point which means you will have to go and buy and wait a bit until they get softer and write a bit more but i'm so short that you will try these muffins because there's no other way thank you so much for watching it really hope you have fun and I'll see you today bye", "V0mQnXSFiDc": "hey guys welcome back it's a holiday season again how can we have no cookies today we'll make fat free ginger cookies you can feel less guilty to eat after having a big holiday dinner since it's fat free haha come on check it out here are the ingredients this recipe calls for a lot of spices when you bake it you can smell holidays cause almost all the winter holiday spices are here let's start with grate some fresh ginger peel the ginger skin first [Music] then grate it i found that using a brush is very good to take off the ginger we need one tablespoon of ginger which is a lot yup it's gonna take forever forever later i finally got one tablespoon of ginger [Music] it's not perfectly full but i'm really downgraded grating it [Music] next take a big bowl add in brown sugar grated ginger molasses [Music] applesauce and combine them [Music] once they are all mixed up add the egg white then use a whisk and mix them well for the dry ingredients add all the spices and baking soda into the flour mix well with a tiny whisk then sift it into a clean bowl or into the wet ingredients directly some black pepper and the salt can't guess through the sifter we need to put them back into the flour then mix all the ingredients [Music] it's a pretty sticky dough make sure all the ingredients are mixed well [Music] then cover it and refrigerate it for at least 3 hours while waiting let's make some cinnamon sugar take 1 3 cup of sugar add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder mix well we will use this to cover our cookies [Music] here is a dough i made earlier which is ready to process we need nitride gloves since the dough is super sticky before making the cookies put down the gloves and rinse your hand with cold water wipe the remaining water on the gloves then let's shape the cookies take about two to three tablespoon dough and ship it into a bowl [Music] then put the cookie ball into sugar bath and coat it with sugar next set it on the baking sheet very classic way to make cookies as you can see the dough is really sticky rinse your hands and the gloves once it becomes too sticky [Music] the size of cookies really depends on your personal preference if you like smaller one just bake shorter time i like to make a bigger one since it's pretty messy to make it the bigger you make the faster you can be done with it now they are ready to bake bake about 10 to 15 minutes until your toothpick tests to come salt clean also as i said it depends on how big your cookie dough is for the leftover cinnamon sugar just sift it and put it into a container you can use it next time well it's time to check our cookies pretty big remove the cookies from baking sheets until they are totally cooled down however i know some of them can't survive that long since someone really can't wait but they are all cooled down remove them from baking sheets by hand or use a flipper they are not hard to remove let's check the texture the cookie has crispy surface but super soft center when you bite it you can taste all these spices but nothing is overpowering it's super good for holidays or daily snack it to reheat very well too just microwave it for 8 to 10 seconds it will taste just like freshly baked this holiday try some fat free cookies be healthier and happier

the smell but a friend told me that he had this and it really didn't smell crazy until you mix it up you gotta break the skin there it is oh yeah [Music] kind of funky peppery dank very earthy [Music] a little bit of lemon i think i smell a little bit of lemon in there um yeah inexperienced eyes would probably overlook the light on flavor the light light on flavor let's just get into it i hope this if it's as this is the way i think it should be and the way i've been told it is uh this is gonna just slap me in the face it's gonna put me on my butt it's gonna be a nice strong heavy indica right up my alleyway between a marijuana okay as far as flavor it's got that earthy pepper you know oh yeah oh we ain't playing games today dear old dad's trying to put himself to sleep whoa let's get it let's go in stuff is [Music] [Laughter] tasty [Music] [Laughter] oh yeah the effects are already hitting me and another potential narcotics victim flows immediate pain relief like straight to the arthritis straight to the hand um yeah [Music] i could tell that it's gonna [Music] run through my body and knock the paint out quite nicely uh i can feel it in my eyelids and the back of my head which is kind of nice usually i feel it behind my eyes but this is definitely like a back of the head feeling tingly definitely like a nice nice hug on the brain [Music] sedative definitely see why they gave it that oh man i think this is gonna be this might end up in the heavy hitters category for me right here this might be a winner of an indica i'm a huge fan of anything that'll help me [Music] get pain out of my hands because they hurt constantly or help me go to sleep at night because i have awful time sleeping because i'm in constant pain and like i'll wake up in the middle of the night at least two three times and i keep the peak next to the bed and i will wake up in pain uh get out of bed lay on the ground for a couple minutes because hard flat surfaces always help and rip the peak and go back to bed after a couple minutes of just chilling but something like this might actually get me through the night which will be nice nice heavy dab of this before bed might not wake up might not have that pain [Music] [Music] i love this thing [Music] [Music] [Music] talk about some quality medicine this is not bad i tell you strong indica [Music] eyelids are definitely heavy super heavy on the eyelids um you can tell i'm going to be hungry as hell probably going to eat a lot of food in 45 minutes to an [Music] hour [Music] so [Music] oh yep gives you a lot of that pepper a lot of that earthiness a little bit of a little bit of lemon not a whole lot though it's definitely very uh [Music] cushy and um yeah you get a lot of that kush a lot of that funky cushy dankness um it's really nice if you're into like really fire uh taste in weed that just tastes like really fire weed it kind of reminds me that kind of a strain it's kind of just like uh you know it's got that earthy pepperiness but then just kind of tastes like fire you know it's one of those so um price for the half ram 50 bones looks amazing smells light it's on the lighter side but still it's still nice you know light but nice nonetheless so light on the smell but strong on the flavor and definitely strong on the effects um coughing like that always gets me but yeah very nice um overall like pain relief is way way up there um it's kind of spacey like i could see this making me just kind of like space out like i could already tell like if i was sitting in a room with just nothing silence and just stared into space i'd probably be okay with it i'd probably just get lost in thought i feel like it's one of those like thinking about nothing but lost in thought if that makes any sense i do that a lot just be thinking about nothing but get lost in thought that's uh that's my jam so yeah uh if you're into indicus that like this killed my pain this like knocked out all the arthritis in my whole body my neck doesn't hurt my hand doesn't hurt nothing nothing hurts anymore like paper said it's good for ptsd if you have ptsd you might want to check this out it's a heavy hitter it's going to do what you need it to do if you have trouble sleeping at night this is probably one for that that's probably gonna help that out this is a good sleepy if you have trouble eating this is gonna make you hungry it's super indica but yeah very chill very nice i feel like the effects outshine the flavor even though the flavor is there and it's like really nice i feel like this one's going to be known for its effects even though all of moxie's stuff kills it with flavor this one this one might be special i can really get behind how this one's making me feel this one's i would recommend this yeah it got me it got me good i don't get i don't get super lit and this one's this one's up there this is like up there with kryptonite this is like this is some heavy stuff also i took like six rips i don't know could be you know but either way it's really strong if you get a chance pick it up i would give it a 10 out of 10. it is surprisingly strong i might pick up another one of these just because of how surprised i am by it wow i am super super stoked about this one yeah two thumbs up pick it up viper cookies by jesus og if you like the videos hit that thumbs up if you're not a

the next one [Music] peace [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "06cjMszPDow": "hey guys it's Greg the frozen food master and you're joining me as I eat my way through the freezer aisle one box at a time it is still July and it is still National Ice Cream month can you imagine a 100 calorie Ice Cream Sandwich too good to be true right there's got to be some sacrifice we're gonna find out in this episode of freezer burns hi welcome to freezerburns today we're reviewing this it is the klondike 100 calorie vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich three dollars and sixty nine cents for this box now if you were with us with our last episode we did the Breyers smooth and dreamy bar that was a hundred and thirty calories per bar and it was really good I gave it a perfect five out of five star as I mentioned in the intro it is still National Ice Cream month and today we're gonna go for this one it's from Klondike formerly slim a bear which I guess it's cute but now just one hundred calorie Klondike bar and let's see what it says on the outside it says artificially flavored vanilla low-fat ice cream sandwiches okay and it's vanilla and it's a sandwich and it's six three fluid ounce eighty eight milliliter sandwiches okay that's interesting now what are we got on the cover nothing much it's way airbrushed it's almost illustrative I don't even know if that's an actual picture but it looks like we got this little like deckle cut Brown chocolatey wafer let's see if it's cakey or more cracker like and then we got this nice swirly ice cream on the inside let's see if that rings true when we actually open it up so as I mentioned 100 calories that's 15 from fat and you know about the sugar thing 10 grams of sugar per bar I'm gonna open this up here here's what we got comes in a plastic wrap decent sized maybe about the Sun you know what this is this is the perfect size is about the diameter of a air hockey puck okay give me an idea of size not like a full-sized ice-cream sandwich or a cookie sandwich that they have this dry on the outside not spongy it's got a little give on here we do have some of that swirl but let's face it it's not as perfect as the box and and whatever is as perfect as the box see how this tears the cake the cake this cookie top and bottom tastes like a 100 calorie pack Oreo type taste I don't have you ever had those horny oh it's not in the freezer aisle but the 100 calorie Oreos it's that kind of taste of the chocolate the combination of the chocolate and the ice cream together yeah certainly tastes like a Ice Cream Sandwich but with just there is a ton of artificial type aftertaste going on here certainly not as pure as I would have liked granted its hundred calorie you're gonna make some sacrifices and in terms of taste I feel like there are a ton of sacrifices here this is the Klondike 100 calorie Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich three dollars and sixty nine cents for a box of six I applaud the 100 calorie type initiative the quantity okay it's probably good if you're carrying about 100 calories but if you truly care about an Ice Cream Sandwich taste or a taste of good vanilla ice cream I think you should stay away from this it's very artificial tasting it leaves a really weird aftertaste one that I personally do not like I give this a two and a half out of five star question of the day what is your favorite thing that's swirly leave it in the comments section or leave me a voicemail of the hungry nation hotline as always I'm the host Greg the frozen food master this has been another review of freezer burns thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "Uw-2DiM8Mvg": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] bye [Music] [Music] you", "qk6RZqpvN18": "hey guys it's time for the January keto crate unboxing sorry it's been a little while since I've done a video but I did have a loss in the family so I just took a little bit of time off and now i'm just getting back into swing of things starting off 2016 right let's look what we got in this box the first thing I'll point out is I think it's pronounced cello wisps it is a parmesan cheese crisp should be interesting I always looking for nice crunchy snacks and I'm a fan of cheese I've tried some other parmesan crisps and things like that so maybe this one will be good got some emerald cocoa roasted almonds this is actually a product I used to eat before quito I just I like almonds in general and the cocoa roasted are really really good I got some big john's original beef jerky always excited to try new jerky this one looks pretty good it's one carbohydrate per serving which isn't too bad and there's three and a half servings in this package here you can see jerky this is 1 i'm happy to see in this box i think i got it in the last so the thing goes keto delivery box it is good DS low-carb cookie mix this is really good i will say this is the first product of both the kido cry and keto delivered services well I just got into the key to cry but it's the first product that I've actually reordered that I got after subscription service got it off amazon got two bags so around christmas kind of is a present to myself i will say i love this and i'll probably order this again in the future just because it's simple don't mix with butter coconut oil an egg bake it you've got instant cookies compared to how hard it is to make your own low-carb cookies this is a lifesaver for me definitely hey guys some really good i like the name it's cute it's a savory snack mix it looks like this one is pumpkin seeds and tail should be should be good seed mix always like snacks I can take and put my desk at work so that should be a plus so I'm also kind of happy to see these there are two Vermont smoke and cure and they're just look like beef snack sticks it's a beef and pork stick excuse me and I got two in the Chipotle flavor just something I'm able to throw in my purse or on my desk at work grab-and-go which is definitely something I like finding new things that I can just take with me whenever I need them then we have a cinephile stress relief drink I'm guessing this is the opposite of an integer energy drink it promotes serotonin and dopamine so I guess if you want to chill out this this is for you now hun I've do a lot of energy drinks so I guess I'll have to find an occasion where I want to just relax for the evening um looks like it has to carbohydrates of can because there's three total carbs in one gram of her throat also i guess too that's it's for the can should be interesting to try that natural antioxidant drink and the last thing we have and this one is a cocoa polo i don't know if i'm saying that right but it's thirty-nine percent milk chocolate toasted whole moments i really like the color on the package it's really nice and vibrant and it claims to have no stevia taste hate stevia so I hope that that claim is a true one because I i'll let you know a hundred percent whether i can taste EP or not um i'm gonna get the post step on my last quito crate review soon i already started working on it just little behind right now but when i do have that up i will link it below in the Shen in the description also try and link some of the nutritional information just so you can skim and see maybe there's something that you might want to try in there and just keep an eye out I'll try and get this stuff all tried for close the end of the month and that way I can get back on schedule and then we'll be rock and roll it again just you know getting stuff you try and snacks and live in life Oh somebody found this video helpful and until my next video just remember to hydrate say she ate and celebrate throughout your day and i'll talk to you later guys do you want to say bye good good sit while us is by you say bye bye say bye bye bye guys", "KNU4y_izoC4": "alright I'm here in the protein bar section of Costco now I wasn't planning on doing a video but I walked on this protein bar aisle and I see that holy cow there is just wall-to-wall protein bars and a lot of them are just total garbage so to be completely honest I wanted to do a video to help shed some light on what you can choose to be the best option for you now truth be told you really shouldn't be relying on a protein bar to get your protein in it's more of just a stopgap let's go ahead and let's take a look at some of the ingredients and some of these things and really try to find a clear winner so that when you go into Costco you can at least find that at least top to protein bars that are worthy of taking home for at least a protein emergency so let's go ahead and let's dive right in but first please do hit that red subscribe button and then hit that little bell icon so you never miss our daily videos all right where to start for those of you that are out there that like cereal and still want to be able to have cereal please do check out magic spoon okay they're a new supporter of this channel but they're a product that I've known for a while these guys are super super super cool maybe you've seen them floating around I just want to throw it out there that they are the bomb when it comes down to a low carb high protein cereal okay these guys absolutely no sugar they're utilizing like a whey protein blend to actually make a protein cereal and you're gonna get a really good deal on this stuff by using the link that's down below so I just want to give them a big shout out because it's totally relevant when I'm talking about breakfast they've got chocolate they've got like a fruity flavor they've got a blueberry flavor they've got a frosted flavor you have to check them out you've probably seen them on Joe Rogan's podcasts all these guys that are reputable within the health industry talk about them so just because it's bright colored and it looks fun doesn't mean that it's unhealthy it's definitely a good way to be able to swap out your breakfast so highly highly highly new legitimately recommend that you try these guys at least give them a shot so the links down below in the description you can check it out after you watch this video and thank you magic spoon for making this channel possible and for helping out so many people with their health okay this first I'm going to start with is a nature valley quote protein bar now nature valley is just kind of a regular candy bar type of granola bar but it looks like they slap the label protein on it to try to capture the attention of well people that are looking for a high protein satiating snack so let's go ahead and let's take a quick look at the ingredients on this onebut flip the camera around okay so here's what the label looks like and then let's go ahead and let's look at the nutrition facts like roasted peanuts that's not too bad to start but soy protein isolate as the second ingredient that is pure adulterated soy okay pure phytoestrogens which is not exactly something that we want when you look at overall thyroid affect when you look at the effect in the body in general soy is not a good ingredient especially that high up on the list chicory root extract not the end of the world but again this high up on the list that's going to be a prebiotic fiber that is going to give you a lot of intestinal discomfort that should not be that high up on the ingredient list so this one's a little bit sketchy already but then the big scary one is the vegetable oils down there okay so in terms of the fats that we're adding to the mix here we've got palm kernel oil which isn't terrible then we've got canola and peanut oil definitely not something I want to have in there the bulk of the protein here it's coming from soy protein isolate which is just not going to be good quality stuff and not worth the paper it's really written on it so this one of course we also probably have some sugar added to it yep oh we're some sugar we have fructose okay remember fructose goes straight to the liver and doesn't really get stored in the muscle let me explain something so here's what happens with fructose and fructose gets in your body okay because fructose can only get metabolized by the liver you can only process like 30 to 40 grams at a time which means the excess fructose goes through what's called de novo lipid Genesis and gets converted into fat very easily but it's also very easy for it to contribute to a fatty liver it's very easy for it to cause all kinds of other effects especially in the world of viruses fructose directly feeds a virus so we have to be really careful with that kind of stuff just in general we're worried about health so this one's a no-go let's move on to the next frankly a lot of these aren't even protein bars so I don't want to waste the time these are just granola bars or peanut bars fruit and nut bars these grain free bars are kind of cool but they're not a protein bar once again in the world of bars though they're not that bad I just know for a fact almonds pecans and maple syrup organic honey okay we still have fructose coming from honey and maple syrup so you have to be careful with that still fructose still gonna go through that same de novo epigenesis thing but at least it's clean ingredients not something I would really feed my family but worst case scenario it's probably one of the cleaner ones now this next one is one that I just stumbled across now I haven't tasted it or anything so I can't really attest to to that price it seems a very expensive it's called a ratio bar and $17.99 for 16 of them ethyl I mean not the end of the world it's still pretty cheap but compared to like the Nature Valley bars right but those are garbage so let's take a look at what's in this one I actually was pretty pleased with the ingredients I'll spin the camera around and then I'll flip it back and explain some stuff in a minute so label looks like this okay let's go in ingredients here we got almonds pumpkin seeds soy protein isolate which is definitely not something we want as far as the protein goes coconut oil erythritol whey protein isolate sugary root extract okay so you remember how we talked about chicory root extract this is further on down the list okay which I appreciate that means it has less of the actual binding fiber that's going to give it sort of the texture but it's further down the list meaning at least prioritize that I like this stevia extract that's gonna be really solid I like that it's a river towel that's better than sugar okay the problem is once again soy protein isolate alright we have a big problem there we don't want to use that now let me explain something with whey protein isolate which I was pleased to see when you're looking for a whey protein you want whey protein isolate not concentrate it means they've taken the protein and they've isolate X Q Z they've taken the way and I've isolated the protein out of it so that means you don't have any to lactose you don't have any of the milk solids you just have pure protein now with soy you end up with a lot of the you know soy isoflavones you end up with a lot of the phytoestrogens and everything like that it's a different story what's funny is they go through the effort of having a high quality whey protein isolate but they have a high or zooming a low quality soy protein isolates it doesn't make any sense they go through might as well just use whey protein concentrate and just use the cruddy stuff point is if it wasn't for the soy protein isolate in that ratio bar I absolutely wouldn't use that I think it's a really clean one and I think it's low sugar so it's not the end of the world it's better than some of the other ones but it definitely doesn't make the top two this is one that people love all the time it's not even a protein bar it's a protein cookie now they've done an amazing job of marketing but we have to be real here for just a second because it's not a bar and it's still thing of the day just a cookie fun fact as I was filming this someone comes up to me says oh my gosh I follow you this is awesome and she's holding one of these and she says is this good or should I put it down I said put it down I could already tell I'm Keeley so we're gonna explain some stuff in here but it's actually quite simple the Linnaean Larry's cookies are not good to go but let's take a look at the ingredients just for the heck of it bad price $13.99 I mean price wise here's what we're looking at label and okay first ingredient enriched wheat flour okay every time you have gluten or wheat you are triggering the release of a protein called Zhong Yulin within your body Zhong Yulin causes a cross reaction that triggers what's called a leaky gut thus leaky gut makes it so that what are called lipopolysaccharides which are basically things that coat your bacteria can leach into your bloodstream compromising your immune system and making you ultimately feel sick okay it doesn't matter if you have a gluten allergy or not even those that are not gluten intolerant will have an issue when it comes down to week 12 Lam Ettore since we have simply over consumed it now additionally what's in there chicory root fiber as the second ingredient okay bloat City once again we don't like to go to bloat City look at the protein blend the lowest quality protein blend I've seen sorry I'm talking quiet so I don't be rude we gluten as a protein pea protein which is okay but then rice protein not even using a way not even using anything they're trying to be able to call it I don't even know how they going for plant-based I don't know what they're going for here point is very low quality stuff and then invert sugar vegetable glycerin which isn't that bad cane sugar peanuts palm fruit oil this stuff is garbage pure garbage honestly I would barely even consider that remotely healthy junk food and I'm not trying to bag on them I feel like their mission was good in the beginning but marketing just caught on anyhow that's not worth again the cardboard that it's on next one was another popular one the rx bar good clean bar but not really a protein bar once again more so just a snack bar so let's take a look at what's inside this one again I actually like the company as a whole I like what they've done with almond butters I like what they've done with some of the nut butters they obviously got their start more so with the bars so let's take a look at what's in here's again what the box looks like okay so 1999 for 16 again not a bad price but let's see what some clean ingredients I do like that dates egg whites cashews almonds chocolate cocoa natural flavors sea salt we have to be careful of natural flavors I don't say avoid natural flavors I'm just saying use caution the thing with natural flavors is there's no real regulation on them there's a hundred and fifty different ultimately chemical compounds that can go into natural flavors known as what are called incidental additives so Organic natural flavors is what you want to aim for it or a company that you know and trust okay our X bar is pretty clean so I'm not too worried about them because I know they have a good reputation so that part doesn't bother me but the protein is coming from a little bit of egg white which is straight albumin which isn't the highest quality protein in my opinion simply because it can trigger an inflammatory reaction let me explain what that means so the dates that are in an Rx bar are still pure fructose okay it's got to be careful with that but then when I was talking about what's with the egg whites so albumin it's a complete protein it's a good protein but the problem is you have to remember that's essentially the placenta for the yolk right so it's full of different immunoglobulins different things that are there to support the immune system of well growing a chicken that can trigger an inflammatory response in humans in fact if you look at like the AIP autoimmune Paleo protocols where they actually remove inflammatory foods eggs are one the first thing they remove however it's not the yolks they're bad it's the white that can be bad can be bad you just have to introduce them to make sure you don't get flushed make sure you don't feel bloated personally I feel bloated my egg whites but I eat a ton of egg yolks anyone just fun fact okay this is the big one this is the one that people ask about all the time so I would be doing it to service if I didn't talk about it the good old Kirkland protein bars people talk about how they taste really good I had on for the first time about three or four months ago surprisingly good taste but let's break down the ingredients I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this and price-wise pretty darn solid check this out can you get 20 of them for 18 bucks so less than a dollar a pop different flavors but anyhow I talked about this in another video check out the ingredient in this surprisingly not bad okay protein blend milk protein isolate remember we want to isolate isolating the protein then we have a whey protein isolate once again isolating the protein from the whey dietary fiber from tapioca starch okay so not using chicory root tapioca is a little bit better you just don't overdo tapioca because what we're finding right now is that people are starting to become sensitive to tapioca because of the overconsumption of it in a much similar way to wheat we developed a gluten intolerances later on in our generations because we've been consuming so much wheat since the 1950s with the fortification and also trying to reduce fat and adding more wheat in we're seeing the same thing with tapioca just be careful there erythritol peanut flour could be inflammatory natural flavors again questionable cocoa powder cocoa powder butter excuse me cocoa process with alkali which just means it's gonna have a higher potassium content sea salt sunflower lecithin not a big deal somewhat of an omega-6 but again this is not something you're trying to eat as a health food unsweetened chocolate so they're not using sweet and chocolate with sugar in it which is great and then we have stevia and Coleco sides which is just straight up here stevia okay that is clean in the world of a protein bar not gonna lie okay now what scares me a little bit 23 grams of carbs 15 of which are from fiber four of which are from our mr. tall that fiber is gonna send you to well you know it bloat City hashtag below city and we'll say though in the world of protein bars it's pretty clean the only thing I would have wanted to really see changed in there is instead of milk protein isolate just left it with whey protein isolate but it probably would have made it less of a creamy taste and they don't really want that so I totally did it that's a good price and that would definitely make the list so I highly recommend that one in the world of Costco protein bars oh one more thing to add to that don't eat more than one or you will definitely be in below city I promise you that making this a little quick here next one Robert Irvine's fit crunch okay these are the bright yellow ones and you can't miss I know from seeing these in other stores they're not the cleanest Robert Irvine should definitely stick to being on the Food Network because he's got a great personality on TV but I'm not sure if he's a good formulator let's take a look at this well maybe I'll meet my words this is what it looks like 18 count still a little under a buck protein blend alright wait hey I will say at least he starts with whey protein isolate not milk protein isolate but then we got whey protein concentrate okay that already kind of notifies it and then ooh soy protein isolate dang it vegetable glycerin vegetable oils palm and palm kernel that's not the end of the world he could be using canola he's using palm and palm kernel oil so he doesn't have to use anything hydrogenated which is great but sugar then sorbitol which is a sugar alcohol gelatin bovine gelatin brown rice flour maltitol talked about below city that's again that's a sugar alcohol that does not digest so basically what it does it causes something called passive diffusion okay it draws water into the gut let me explain this it draws water into the colon and it ferments it essentially rots in your gut but it doesn't digest so they can call it something that doesn't affect your blood sugar I've seen enough that ingredient list was really long that ingredient list was really dirty that one definitely does not make the gun another one that comes up in question all the time is pure protein I'll save you a lot of time and headache and just flip the camera around and get right to it but I think they're starting to get the gist about the common ingredients and a lot of these just inexpensive protein bars are so when I'm in a little bit under a buck once again oh here we go milk protein isolate not the end of the world whey protein isolate nothing up then it goes to concentrate hydrolyzed collagen so they're getting a protein from a little bit of collagen but once again we've got that maltitol in there fractionated palm kernel oil sugar again milk unsweetened chocolate and oh my gosh okay so if you're gonna put sugar in it you already have sugar and soy lecithin but you're gonna put sucralose in it too that doesn't make any sense let's give you the worst of both worlds let's give you sugar but let's also kill your gut microbiome with sucralose that's a little sketchy not make the cut unfortunately obviously the Kirkland bars were designed to kind of take them out and I would definitely recommend that one so there's an interesting study that found that in human subjects if they had any kind of artificial sweetener it would make them glucose intolerance okay and then when they took their gut bacteria after becoming glucose intolerant and transferred it into mice the mice became glucose intolerant what that means is artificial sweeteners actually have an effect on our gut microbiome which has an effect on our sugar and glucose metabolism meaning if you eat a bunch of artificial sweeteners you change your gut microbiome and sucralose has been shown in other studies to literally kill off up to 50% of your gut bacteria that is scary scary stuff so when I get upset about the fact that our dicas sugar we've already done the damage with sugar okay why do we also have to do damage with sucrose it's like one or the other pick your poison sugars gonna cause a bunch of metabolic distress sucralose is gonna cause a bunch of digestive and gut biome distress why have both so that definitely that's probably one of the worst ones here to say I hate to say it okay we're down to almost the last one here this one is one called smart for life which is a relatively new one let's take a look at the price once again they're all about the same but this is a new one so I haven't really investigated it let's see that's what the label looks like collagen infused gluten-free okay that's a plus $15.99 for 18 of them whoa that's a lot of ingredients okay so let's take just one of them protein blend soy protein nuggets okay which contains soy protein tapioca starch and salt then milk protein not even milk protein isolate so you're gonna you're gonna use soy protein as the protein source might as well try to make it a vegan bar but nope then they go straight to milk protein but again not even go protein isolate just straight milk protein collagen coming from egg and kosher bovine okay that's a plus tapioca syrup soluble corn fiber okay SCF is dangerous stuff soluble corn fiber ferments in the gut a soluble corn fiber is derived from heavy duty GMO corn starch okay bad bad bad news then canola oil oh man so omega-6 bomb that's smoked listen milk chocolate coating which has a riff through tall malt so again here's what I don't know scent you're using a river tall which is a pretty clean sugar alcohol and then you also use multi salt but then you also use sugar and sustainable for me I don't understand it the world the processed foods is so sketchy like there's so much just nasty stuff that they throwing things just to increase shelf life and the reality is if they just went a little bit cleaner they could probably sell a little bit more to be honest if people start educating themselves which they are we can make better decisions on this stuff now there's only one more that I want to show you and then we'll have our two clear winners the go macro bar but this isn't even a protein bar to be completely honest okay it's kind of another let's see here's what I like about it its organic ingredients it is vegan it's clean organic brown rice syrup organic almond butter organic protein blend which is sprouted brown rice protein organic pea protein very clean organic puffed rice organic fair trade and chocolate chips actually a very clean bar to be completely honest when it comes down to it this one is one that I would recommend it's just not the highest protein okay so we have proteins here let's see only 11 grams of protein but 36 grams of carbs okay and again the sugar is gonna be coming from brown rice syrup which is not going to be the best solution here for us so technically yes it's a protein bar but since they're using the brown rice syrup that's a again it's a syrup sugar that's being directly derived from a brown rice which is going to make it a little bit better than say I don't know like a corn fiber or corn syrup or something like that and at least it's organic so at least it's not going to be as bad so that probably does make the cut at least for the best plant-based options the go macro bar for the best plant-based non keto bar but the cleanest ones otherwise are gonna be these two I'll be say the ratio bar even though it does have some soy in it not the end of the world okay so the ratio bar does make the cut but I haven't tasted it now I just say keto friendly which I don't really buy that and sugar alcohol yeah not really kind of two differently calls itself a protein bar was not a protein bar basically a knock off of a kind bar so technically not a protein bar also not a protein bar just so you know okay protein cookie disguised in disguise our X bar not really a protein bar but at least clean go macro bar gonna be the cleanest plant-based option not Quito we got the kind bar minis which again are not a protein bar then we've got Z bars not a protein bar Clif bars not a protein bar and in the cliff builders I don't even want to touch them to be honest I already know at least they are gluten-free and low glycemic that's a plus but they don't make the cut so we had those ratio bars and then we have the Kirkland bars okay these are going to be the two that you should choose when it comes down to it plain and simple obviously I could go into a lot more depth but I want to be respectful of everybody's done so I do want to encourage everyone to keep watching my channel but also if you're interested in a video that I did on protein powders at Costco I'll link out to it below and YouTube will probably recommend it but I highly recommend that one cuz I break down a lot more of the detail of what goes into a protein powder not in just a protein bar

on keto know what is seriously this is our diet food well let's be serious we're having cookies on a diet basic ingredients for chocolate-chip cookies first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna melt down butter so I've got a full stick of butter wave and soften it up so I'm gonna put it in for about 45 seconds use a mix of brown swerve and powdered swerve today instead of using a granulated sugar with the butter you're gonna melt the butter first and then cream this work together with that milk chocolate chips so they're gonna be my old house version I'm gonna probably use a cup of these and I will put all the macros here on my site from now on for the new year for you guys that are just getting into key to oh I will do the macros for you if your screamed I'm gonna put in my sugar 1/2 cup of swerve brown sugar is in the bowl half a cup of powdered swerve now cream list together this should take you about ten minutes to make it the most it gets a super quick recipe just mix it up well sometimes the brown sugar of the swerve lumps up a bit so just push it over I'll just get rid of those lumps I'm gonna use a quarter teaspoon of salt which is about two and a half twist I'm gonna use a teaspoon of vanilla [Music] I'm going to use about a cup and a quarter of almond flour I'm going to use two teaspoons of baking soda setup just lightly and then we can throw in our eggs now since of course I've never made this before but I'm sure they're gonna be the best-tasting cookies for keto you've ever had have I sold two hands I've got the oven preheating to 350 now you can either make these with nuts or without with the walnuts in the in the description below so I've got a cup of Lily's milk chocolate chips I'm gonna put in gold lately that's it I have not been in here ten minutes you guys right now makings I'm gonna chop up a little bit of walnuts throw them in pulled in our nuts so what that was probably about two tablespoons of walnuts that's what I meant penned in the recipe okay there's your deal as good as Tollhouse we shall see put coconut oil on and drop them on the pan now since I've never made these I don't know what they're gonna taste like with the brown sugar but I'm hoping pretty good I don't know how many cookies is gonna make yet but I will like I said tell you the exact macros in the recipe and how many it makes the timer for 10 minutes cuz I don't know how long they're gonna take us this is first time making them but they just came out of the oven they're perfectly brown this has been about 13 minutes so I'm gonna let them cool this time

good third time I want to kick the carbs down so I don't want to put in more almond flour but I would cut back the butter I would cut back to the butter to probably a half a stick next time I'll make them again [Music] oh my god there it's so good people say don't eat that with the raw egg I do have another recipe here a chocolate peanut butter that my dad absolutely loves that I made when the

use them differences between the 2006 and 2016 labels who determines what nutrition information is included how food makers manipulate serving sizes and nutrition information and the consumers need to know so why have nutrition facts labels in 1990 the us congress passed and president george h.w bush signed into law the nutrition labeling and education act the act gave the fda authority to require nutrition labels for most foods it regulated primarily processed foods fresh produce was exempted because it's regulated by the usda bagged produce is regulated by the fda and have nutrition labels labeling fresh meat is complicated because the usda regulates meat produced in the u.s and the fda imported beet poultry and seafood individually sold baked goods don't have nutrition labels but in some cases they must display the number of calories packaged baked goods sold in two or more states must have nutrition labels nutrition labels can help you make informed decisions when buying prepared foods some people buy what they like and ignore nutrition labels there's a saying that knowledge is power the nutrition labeling and education act was passed to educate consumers about prepared food nutrition with home cooking you control the ingredients and how foods are prepared and cooked that's not the case with prepared foods even restaurant menu items that seem healthier can provide more calories and sodium than most people need while national restaurant chains disclose calories it can still be confusing as to how many calories are in your meal in most cases you must go to the restaurant's website for complete nutrition information and local restaurants aren't required to disclose any nutrition information with increasing obesity and type 2 diabetes it's important knowing what's in your food when buying prepared foods nutrition labels helps you compare different brands besides calories per serving you can compare the amount of saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium carbohydrates fiber added sugar and protein nutrition labels can help people with cardiovascular disease limit saturated fat cholesterol and sodium in their diet people with diabetes can limit total carbs and sugar in their diet you can use nutrition labels to increase the amount of fiber in your diet and the amount of protein while nutrition labels tell you how much protein is in a food it doesn't tell you if the protein is high or low quality to avoid food allergens in prepared foods you must review the list of ingredients food allergens are usually listed below the list of ingredients there has been no significant changes to the nutrition label since trans fat was added in 2006. there are significant differences between the 2006 and 2016 nutrition labels the first being the emphasis on serving size and second the emphasis on calories per serving but keep in mind that not all calories are equal getting 200 calories from nuts is not the same as 200 calories from a nut flavored spread other changes include eliminating the number of calories from fat increasing the daily value of total fat by 20 percent including added sugars and a daily value for added sugars the daily value is 50 grams for both men and women in the list of vitamins and minerals vitamin d has replaced vitamin a and potassium has replaced vitamin c like calories it makes a difference if vitamins and minerals are natural or added white flour is enriched to add back vitamins and minerals lost during refining getting vitamins and minerals from whole grains is better than from enriched grains or products one exception is vitamin d most foods are poor sources of vitamin d because the body makes vitamin d from sun exposure people with limited sun exposure must get vitamin d from dietary supplements or fortified foods like milk and breakfast cereals the last significant change is eliminating the panel that listed fat cholesterol sodium carbs and fiber based on the number of calories in your diet you can still estimate quantities by dividing the weight by the daily value for example 160 milligrams of sodium has a daily value of 7 percent dividing 160 milligrams by 7 percent equals 2286 milligrams of sodium but keep in mind that all values are rounded a good example is the mineral potassium 240 milligrams of potassium divided by six percent equals four thousand milligrams per day rounding can create strange values like zero milligrams of potassium providing two percent of the daily value or in this example 50 milligrams of potassium provides zero percent of the daily value if you think that's confusing these nutrition labels are for foods in small packages like condiments i find the tabular format easier to read than the linear format the linear format is one way to discourage shoppers from comparing nutrition values so who determines what nutrition information is included on the label u.s food companies would like to control all nutrition label and packaging information without government interference it's known as deregulation and reducing the size of government for now the fda makes rules regarding nutrition label appearance and what information to include in this era of deregulation some rules like serving sizes are non-binding recommendations serving sizes are supposed to be based on what can reasonably be consumed at one eating occasion some people can eat more at one occasion than others fda serving sizes don't emphasize how many calories and nutrients individuals need there are many ways food companies can manipulate serving sizes and nutrition information one might assume the average person will eat in one occasion both cookies in this package that's not what the fda and manufacturer assume according to the fda a serving size of cookies is 30 grams one fig bar is 28 grams close enough to the fda's 30 grams some people may believe the 110 calories is for the entire package not just one bar most cookie makers base their serving size around the 30 gram serving size this is one serving providing 160 calories i have friends who can eat the entire contents in one occasion about 1900 calories if you're selling cookies 110 calories per serving sounds a lot healthier than 220 calories the maker of this toaster pastry also assumes people will only eat just one even though there are two pastries per package the nutrition information is for one pastry this will change with the 2016 label the 2016 labeling rules are supposed to reflect more accurately what americans eat in one occasion for decades serving sizes have underestimated how much people actually ate again if you want food to appear healthy or low calorie limit the serving size for most people one serving of most cold breakfast cereals is a snack before adding milk a realistic serving of cold breakfast cereal can be three or more servings before the 2016 labeling rules a serving of cold breakfast cereal was about 28 grams the new recommendations increased the serving size to about 40 grams cereal manufacturers are now using the larger 40 gram serving size if you ate this 85 gram serving you're eating more than twice the fda serving size food makers can cut calories by manipulating nutrition information for example a 31 gram serving using the 2006 label added one-half cup of skim milk but so does the new 41 gram serving size i don't know about you when i eat more cereal i usually add more milk and what if you prefer whole milk to skim milk then it's up to you to calculate calories per serving it's not uncommon for someone to eat this entire sandwich in one occasion i know i can according to the fda a serving size for sandwiches is 140 grams so nutrition information is provided for one quarter sandwich a serving of bread and rolls is 50 grams this store bakery roll is 2 servings at 100 grams it's perfectly legal providing nutrition information for one half roll the fda serving size for snack foods is 30 grams about one ounce most people eat more than one ounce of potato chips and other snack foods even with the new nutrition labels it's buyer beware when it comes to prepared foods food companies spend billions of dollars marketing their products and millions lobbying lawmakers to conceal nutrition information from the public most people would think twice about eating a donut that provides 50 or more of their daily calorie needs originally food makers had two years from 2016 to 2018 to begin using the new nutrition labels as usual large food companies vocally protested two years was not enough time and the cost would be astronomical food companies routinely change the package design to reduce the amount of food update the list of ingredients for new chemical additives and preservatives for more eye appeal to announce their new and improved product and emphasize fad health diet benefits like high protein or gluten free in 2018 the maker of this product changed the package to boast it had more frosting and still use the 2006 nutrition label the reason why in just a moment the new administration sympathized with the multi-billion dollar food companies and extended the deadline to january 1st 2020 small companies with less than 10 million dollars in annual sales had until january 1st 2021 with the new label emphasizing calories and added sugar you may get more than just a new nutrition label or you may get less 2020 brought a new nutrition label and 30 less calories how did they do that the usual way they reduce the serving weight from 104 grams to 96 grams you didn't expect them to reduce the amount of added sugar and add more fruit filling you now pay more for eight percent less food some takeaways are your diet comes down to individual choices many serious chronic diseases are due to diet and lifestyle choices food manufacturers and restaurant owners have a vested interest withholding nutrition information from you they're in business to make money and will gladly sell you what you want not necessarily what you need knowledge is power you know your body better than anyone else it's your choice whether or not to use nutrition and other information to make healthy choices please leave a comment if you have any questions about this video thank you for watching and healthy eating [Music] you", "73Z5P-ies7I": "[Music] you you [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you you [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music]", "GeYMjTJTDjo": "[Music] [Music] hey everyone how's it going welcome back to chef vic cuisine today we're going to making some apple pie cookies now this is a new take on the traditional apple pie it's a real eye catcher and it's perfect for fall so let's get started all right so for the ingredients we have four main categories i'm going to start with the first so for making the caramel you're gonna need one cup of brown sugar five tablespoons of unsalted butter half a cup of heavy cream one tablespoon of vanilla extract and then a pinch of salt and now for the filling you're gonna need two pounds of apples so i normally use either gala golden delicious or honey crisp and then you need two-thirds cup of white sugar plus some additional for the topping of the pie cookies you're going to need a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon [Music] you need one pinch of nutmeg two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice so about the juice of one lemon a quarter cup of unsalted butter and now for the dough you're going to need two and a half cups of flour plus some additional for rolling four tablespoons of granulated white sugar [Music] half a teaspoon of kosher salt two teaspoons of cinnamon plus some additional for the topping you need one teaspoon of ground allspice so in this video i'm gonna ground it myself [Music] half a teaspoon of ground ginger and then one cup of unsalted butter and it's going to be chilled and then 4 tablespoons of ice water and then finally for your egg wash you're going to need 1 egg [Music] and then one tablespoon of heavy cream all right so to get things started we're gonna make the caramel so you want to mix the brown sugar the unsalted butter the heavy cream vanilla extract and salt all in a small pot and heat it over medium low heat or 249 degrees fahrenheit or 120 degrees celsius and you want to cook this caramel for seven to eight minutes and you want to whisk it often and you'll notice that the caramel will begin to thicken over time and after the eight minutes passed you want to remove that from the heat and set it aside to cool [Music] once you start to see those large bubbles form that's when you know the mixture is becoming caramel so make sure you keep mixing it throughout so it doesn't harden too much now for the fun part making the cookie filling so you want to peel and dice the apples into small bite-sized chunks [Music] in this video i'm using a kitchenaid which is a real time and lifesaver when it comes to making the filling of this cookie but you can always do this by hand or you can use an apple dicer which is a really cheap tool you can find for your kitchen your ultimate goal is to get as small of pieces you can of the apple to make it easy to fill each apple pie cookie [Music] and your goal here is to have little to no apple peel and apple cookies so make sure to remove as much of the skin as you can you also want to core each of your apples and remove any apple seeds you may find so try to dice your apples into the size of the pieces that you see in this video once the apples are all roughly chopped you want to put these in a bowl and then add the sugar the cinnamon nutmeg and then the lemon juice you want to toss the apples around in this mix until they're all well coated now in a large skillet you want to melt the butter over medium-high heat which is about 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190 degrees celsius you want to add your diced apples and cook them stirring the mixture until the sugar dissolves and it begins to simmer and this should take about two to three minutes [Music] now you want to cover the skillet reduce the heat to medium-low or about 249 degrees fahrenheit or 120 degrees celsius and cook until the apples soften and release most of the juices and that should take about seven to eight minutes [Music] after the eight minutes are up you want to strain the apples into a fine mesh sieve over a medium sized bowl to catch all the juice and now you want to return the juices to the skillet and simmer those over a medium heat which is about 350 degrees fahrenheit 176 degrees celsius and you want to do that until the juice is thickened and lightly caramelized for about eight to ten minutes so as you can see as you reduce the juice it starts to brown and lightly caramelized so this is what you're looking for before you turn the heat off [Music] so after the 10 minutes and that same medium bowl you want to toss the caramelized apples with the juice reduction and then set that all aside to cool completely now for making the crust in a large size bowl you want to mix together the flour the sugar the salt cinnamon the ground all spice and ground ginger you want to whisk that all together until it's all well combined and now you want to grate in the chilled butter and drizzle in slowly the ice cold water so as you can see in this video i'm using a food processor to blend all these ingredients together and the resulting dough will be quite brittle so you have to handle it carefully i know this looks like cheese but it's actually the chilled butter that you're grating and you want to make sure that it's chilled otherwise it'll melt too quickly in the dough and then your dough won't hold any shape [Music] so keep adding tablespoons of ice cold water to the mixture until the dough starts to take form and now you want to shape the resulting dough into two large dough mounds and then wrap each of those in plastic or place them in a large ziploc bag and chill those for 20 minutes now separately you want to pour one egg and a tablespoon of heavy cream into a small bowl whisk the egg and the cream together and then chill that egg wash until you're ready to use it [Music] so after about 20 minutes you want to remove the dough from the refrigerator and use a lightly floured rolling pin and a lightly floured rolling surface to roll the pastry dough out to about a quarter inch thick so one half of the dough is for making the bases of the cookies and the other half is for the lattice tops [Music] so cut the cookie bases using a round cookie cutter into circles from one of the rolled dough mounds and from the other mound of dough you're going to roll it out and cut out your latest top pieces [Music] and then you want to add a dollop of the caramel you made in the beginning of this video onto the tops of each of the cookie bases [Music] so the best way to start assembling the cookies is on the prepared baking sheet instead of making them elsewhere and transferring them on there the cookies as i mentioned earlier can be pretty fragile and so you don't want them to crumble apart as you transfer them all right so for forming the cookies you want to add about one to two tablespoons of the apple pie filling to the center of each circle base and then you want to brush the edge of each cookie with the egg wash i mean how good is this looking already [Music] now from the other rolled out dough mound you want to cut out the lattice pieces about one inch wide and four inches long and you want to arrange the lattice top and brush the top of these cookies with the egg wash again [Music] now once you've assembled your cookies you want to cut and remove the excess dough edges of the lattices with the cookie cutter you use for the base so you can clean up the look of each cookie for finishing touches i normally will always add a sprinkle of additional sugar and cinnamon to each of the cookies and now you want to bake all of these at 350 degrees fahrenheit or 176 degrees celsius for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're golden brown [Music] and just like that [Applause] this recipe is such an eye catcher it's perfect for the fall perfect mix of flavor and flaky crunch and this recipe makes more caramel and apple pie filling than you'll need for the cookies so you can always store it for future use or use it as a dip and don't mind the mess that the caramel makes after you bake it these all clean up really nicely [Music] if you want to make more cookies i would say just increase the ingredients for the dough amount as i mentioned earlier the ingredients for the caramel and apple pie filling are more than you'll need for this recipe so all you'll need to do is make more dough to make the cookie bases with as always this recipe and many more can be found in my cookbook chef vic cuisine finding your inner chef and that's available on amazon and i'll make sure to leave the link to that in the description box [Music] these cookies are super soft and they melt in your mouth and they'll be gone before you know it [Music] don't forget to smash that

you're joining me as i eat my way through the freezer aisle one box at a time it is still july and it is still national ice cream month can you imagine a 100-calorie ice cream sandwich too good to be true right there's got to be some sacrifice we're going to find out in this episode of freezerburns hey stop hi welcome to freezerburns today we're reviewing this it is the Klondike 100-calorie vanilla ice cream sandwich three dollars and sixty nine cents for this box now if you were with us with our last episode we did the briars smooth and dreamy bar that was 130 calories per bar it was really good I gave it a perfect five out of five star as I mentioned in the intro it is still National Ice Cream month and today we're going to go for this one it's from Klondike formerly slim a bear which I guess it's cute but now just 100 calorie Klondike bar and let's see what it says on the outside it says artificially flavored vanilla low-fat ice cream sandwiches okay and it's vanilla and it's a sandwich and it's 63 fluid ounce 88 milliliter sandwiches okay that's interesting now what do we got on the cover nothing much its way airbrushed it's almost illustrative I don't even know if that's an actual picture but it looks like we got this little like deco cut brown chocolatey wafer let's see if it's cakey or more cracker like and then we got this nice swirly ice cream on the inside let's see if that rings true when we actually open it up so as I mentioned 100 calories that's 15 from fat and you know about the sugar thing 10 grams of sugar per bar I'm going to open this up here and here's what we got comes in a plastic wrap decent size maybe about the Sun you know what this is this is the perfect size is about the diameter of a air hockey puck okay give you an idea of size not like a full-size ice cream sandwich or a cookie sandwich that they have this dry on the outside not spongy it's got a little give on here we do have some of that swirl but let's face it it's not as perfect as the box and and whatever is as perfect as the box let's see how this tis the cake the cake this cookie top and bottom taste like a 100 calorie pack Oreo type taste I don't have you ever had those oreo it's not in the freezer aisle but the 100 calorie Oreos it's that kind of taste of the chocolate the combination of the chocolate and the ice cream together yeah certainly tastes like a I scream sandwich but with just there is a ton of artificial type aftertaste going on here certainly not as pure as i would have liked granted it's hundred calorie you're going to make some sacrifices and in terms of taste i feel like there are a ton of sacrifices here this is the Klondike 100 calorie vanilla ice cream sandwich three dollars and sixty nine cents for a box of six I applaud the 100 calorie type initiative the quantity okay it's probably good if you're carrying about 100 calories but if you truly care about an ice cream sandwich taste or a taste of good vanilla ice cream I think you should stay away from this it's very artificial tasting it leaves a really weird aftertaste one that I personally do not like I give this a two and a half out of five star question of the day what is your favorite thing that's swirly leave it in the comments section or leave me a voicemail of the hungry nation hotline as always I'm your host Greg the frozen food master this has been another review of freezerburns thanks for watching and I'll see you next time me", "OdDURorBE2U": "hello everyone my name is Angelica today we're in my kitchen and you may not be aware about this on your feet you don't really see me in this way very often because I mean I'm not a good entertainer and the really lazy I don't want to put makeup all and most of the time girls like today but who cares and so today we're here for a very special recipe and I'm a very big chocolate fan absolutely love chocolate I will eat chocolate any time of the day but I'm aware of the risks are not following a healthy lifestyle so obviously we have an amazing vegan protein pudding and the dry mix which is chocolate flavor I mean it's called chocolate and reality's flavored we've actually reduced pa\u00e7oca so it doesn't have an artificial slavery to give the cocoa flavor to the e to the powder I'm not a good Baker but I absolutely love eating chuckling gooey cakes or brownies with my coffee so I was crawling lean again and stuff and I was looking for like a protein mud cake I've been finding a few and then realizes like I've got such an amazing product the consistency of our chocolate but particular thing is just so creamy I'm rich I was like I need to try it in a mill cake recipe so we did and guess what it came out amazing so it's like four ingredients it's absolutely quick to make so even if you're in a hurry absolutely five minutes it's done you can it on the way you feel like I don't know if you're willing to take your mug outside your house I don't know we don't judge but and you stay with me 35 minutes and that's ready so let's get cracking right so everything is already being set up here and I've really mixed my powders here we got our almond milk this isn't sweetened we prefer to any sweetened because our vegan protein pudding mix it's already been sweetened the wheat sweeteners however if you prefer is sweeter obviously you can add any sugars we can all of choice and we prefer it this way but again it's done to your personal taste now I don't have a gluten sensitivity so about that normal white flour but if you do have gluten sensitivity obviously you need to use a gluten-free flour our vegan protein pudding just a reminder it's absolutely allergen free so it's suitable for any free form from diet so anyway back to my mix here we have equal parts of vegan protein pudding and flour now I'm going to leave in the description the quantities of each ingredient but yes it's flour and vegan present whether you need to be in the same and quantity so and also got a little bit of become what it become right so that because although I'm not a good Baker out of the basic so knowing it's your eyes so I just mix the powder it's new in a bowl you can actually do it directly in the mug if you like needs a clear month because I'm obsessed your mugs and so yeah we just gotta mix it and then we can add our almond milk so our vegan protein protein is absolutely easy to mix it's very easy to mix because of its formulation we shouldn't get any lumps at the end of our mix it's actually harder to do in a bowl I usually do it in the month of cause I am very lazy I don't wanna worship anything I'm always in a rush you know before lockdown waking up early everyday having you to be out of the house early and whatnot so I was always always trying to like make things quickly so I usually do everything in one pot or you everything in like you know in this case I do it directly bug I'm just doing it in here just like for shop purposes they say that I'm making a mess here guys so as you can see Lord these are absolutely like mixing so well obviously I need to finish here there is some more but as you can tell there is no there is no love she's like quite screaming for assistance consistent so basically ready if you feel like you need a bit more if you feel like you need a little bit more liquid obviously you can it's all down to the flower you using as well or how much powders you using and as I said all the quantities for the for my recipe will be below and I'm going to put a picture or I'm going to write down in the description the nutritional value because it's been calculated just like if you are following a certain ratio of macros you know you can't keep track of that as well no I realized through cacao really transfer it into my mop so let's go read the offs before let's pour it in a mother trying not to like I spill it everywhere I don't know if you can see looks who's ready to see break GUI so now we're gonna put it in the microwave microwave hum speak to the other nor what's happening so you're gonna put it in the microwave and my suggestion is to you know set a time like a couple of minutes and keep checking on it like I don't know every every minute or so just like you've check in because again different ratios of power there other if you want to make more of this quantity obviously might need to cook more but my issue is if you cook it for too long it may get it's not even doing it well but it gets chilly and so you need to keep cook it the right amount of time you're gonna be able to see it because on the top it does look like kind of a browning kind of thing so kind of put now in the microwave couple of minutes I'm going to check through it just to make sure that when we take it out it's ready and then I'm gonna promise you it's gonna look ugly but it's gonna taste delicious so let's go to the microwave so that was already set guys so two minutes I put mine on the high just because stars an alarming patient it might be even best to make it you know like you know the power made may be best to be a little bit lower you can just like test it with your microwave and we're gonna check through it and once it's ready I'm gonna get back to you and I'm going to show you how gooey and how chocolate this mug cake is gonna be so guys Dizzy's our mug cake once it came out of the microwave like look at how chocolaty and gooey it looks like accommodated and it's later just four ingredients just four ingredients not even two minutes because I've stopped it at one minute and a half so and it's a protein mug cake hard to believe right you have an amazing chocolate cotton ball cake to demolish and right I can't wait to eat it and just prove my very good double espresso like the great something about and yeah can't wait to have it don't forget that you can request your free software on the website so you can try it out on yourself and also don't forget that at the moment we have 30% of using the code fifth thing it's a the header of the website so you won't forget and I'll see you next time thank you for watching and enjoy your day", "pikFbVxG7rU": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel if you notice anything different yes i got a new camera so this will be the first video with this new camera i have really been craving cookie recently basically just any sweets so i guess today i'm gonna make my favorite chocolate chip cookie and i'm gonna make a video this specific recipe i use is egg free so if you're someone who doesn't want any egg in your cookies or in your diet in general you can maybe consider this recipe first thing first we're gonna need 40 grams of butter and 10 grams of milk i have this bowl from tupperware so i'm gonna put the butter and milk in and then i'm gonna put it in the microwave for around 10 to 20 seconds i actually already put a little bit more milk but i guess should be fine because the very small amount of milk i use it's actually already a bit hot i'm gonna use this spatula we have to mix them together and mash the butter a little bit right now the butter is all in some tiny pieces so i'm gonna add the sugar in we're gonna need 60 grams of sugar i actually put more sugar than the original recipe because it's cookie it needs to be sweet i don't want a dozen cardboard i just need one very good cookies [Applause] the sugar is already inside and now i'm gonna mix them together usually when i'm cooking i try to use the minimum amount of tulle as possible so i don't need to wash so much of them afterwards although we have a dishwasher at home still so now i'm just going to put one pack of this vanilla sugar inside actually i should have weighed it with the rest of the sugar so the total amount will be 60 gram but i forgot a little bit more sugar wouldn't hurt the texture looks like a bit like this now i'm just gonna put one pinch of salt and 60 grams of flour and one gram of baking powder whoops that's actually already two gram i just preheated all the never 170 celsius and with the the mold with the wind yeah and now i'm just gonna mix them all together oh i'm so sweaty now it's basically done this dough is a bit uh this dough is a bit more dry than the usual cookie dough but i think it worked just fine and now i'm just gonna put in some chocolate chips to my liking which means a lot you can of course use some cocoa powder i'm just gonna go for it and everything in this is actually a very small amount of dough as you can see so if you're if you live alone or maybe just with someone else so two person it won't be too much i'm so sweaty i guess but let's see how many cookies this will make it smells very nice uh can you see it now i'm just gonna put the baking sheet and put the cookie on top of this tray [Applause] i'm actually pretty nervous because last time i tried to make a baking video i didn't even end up posting it i'm gonna use this small spoon just to help a bit with the cookie now the cookie is finished i finished putting the cookie on the tray now i'm just gonna flatten them a little bit with the spatula if you don't do this those weird bit that's sticking out with the tips those might get pretty brown i'm just trying to do as best as i could they don't need to be perfect i'm not sure if you can see the sweat from my face but i'm literally sweating like a pig anyway let me show you the cookie before they go into the oven so this is my tiny cookies they have some mark on it but i guess i hope they'll be fine i'm so so sweaty anyway the cookie is already in the oven and usually it takes 10 to 20 minutes but depends on your oven basically when you see them [Music] golden brown or any color you prefer you can just take it out easy as that when the cookie is ready i'll show you the final result and i'm gonna have a taste test so i just took them out and this is how they look i'm gonna let them cool off a little bit on this trade and i will transfer them to a play or some sort i

welcome to another episode of the blue wizard makes I'm what what do you mean hold on [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh hey and welcome to another episode of the blue wizard no Banks I'm Joe the blue wizard you know throughout my life I always heard the phrase easy as pie but then what I actually started making pies for myself I got a little confused because pie is it very easy everything from making the perfect pastry dough to rolling it out thin enough to forming it properly to making the perfect filling to baking it for just the right amount of time I mean it can be a little bit finicky and with Thanksgiving coming up here in the US there's a lot of pressure out there to make the perfect pie especially when it comes to pumpkin pie so that got me thinking I should put together a recipe that allows you to make the perfect pumpkin pie but doesn't take a lot of work effort or a lot of stress and that perfect pie is my no baked pumpkin pie it tastes just like the original but none of the stress so let's head over to the kitchen so that we can put the easy back in easy as pie all right so now that we're here we're going to do what we normally do well almost we're not going to be preheating our oven today because remember we're making a no bake recipe however we are going to be getting our ingredients together so that we have everything we need where we need it when we need it so let's make some magic all right so now that we have everything together it's time for us to get started with our crust now since this is a no bake a pie we're actually going to be making a graham cracker crust for this recipe because though you can make a graham cracker crust you don't have to and so that's gonna make our crust really easy to do with our no big pie so we're gonna start off with one package of graham crackers and this package holds nine graham crackers which is about the cent about standard not the same if you go up to ten not a big deal and I'm gonna take and place these graham crackers into a gallon sized and black bag don't come for me I know that it's holiday and it's not the holidays yet I get it okay it's just the ones that I had like around the house alright so now that we have graham crackers in the bag we're going to take and break them up and crush them with a rolling pin now there are two ways that you can go about this you can go about it the nice easy way gently pressing against the crumbs or you can do it the fun way all right so what you're looking for us to get some nice fine crumbs you don't want to have any big chunks inside of there okay and so I think that that's a good consistency now if you have a food processor you could always take and put the graham crackers inside the food processor and give it a couple of pulses and then it's done just in a few seconds but I figured why not we do it this way this way you know that you really don't have to have any sort of like super powered equipment in order to get this done well after our graham crackers have been crushed up into nice fine crumbs we're going to take and add in some coconut oil so coconut oil is a solid at room temperature and so it could be used as a substitute for butter in a lot of recipes so this coconut oil even though it's a solid at room temperature I've taken and melted in the microwave for about 30 seconds this way it's going to be able to coat our graham cracker crumbs a lot more easily and I'm using about four tablespoons of the coconut oil in here so I'm just gonna dump that right in the back this way we don't have to dirty another dish and then I'm going to take and sort of move it around inside the bag and notice I'm being very careful because I've left the top of the bag open I feel like if you seal the top of the bag there gets like air trapped in there and then it's harder to move around so I actually leave the top of the bag open I'm just very careful when I'm moving it around so it doesn't spill out the top so now that all those graham cracker crumbs are coated with the oil I'm going to take and place it into our pie dish this is a nine inch pie plate that I'm using and you can see it a lot easier from this angle but our graham cracker crumbs are the consistency of wet sand and that's exactly what you're looking for if you find that they're a little bit too dry you can always add just a little bit more coconut oil all right so now that our crumbs are inside of our 9-inch pie plate we're going to take and press them in and I want to press the crumbs in to the bottom of the pan as well as up the sides and you'll notice that as I'm pressing them up the sides that I am making sure also to press against the top of the side portion as well this way we get a nice clean top to our crust and after I get a nice good shape to it about what I want I want to make sure to press these down firmly with a flat bottom object I'm using just a little cup that I use to measure out my coconut oil and again we want to get that pressed down nice and firm so that the graham crackers hold themselves together when the pie is done and ready to go [Music] and if you see any cracks like you see right here you could just instantly press more crumbs into that area it's very forgiving very easy to do and that's good all right so now that our crust has put together and is well formed we're going to take and place it into the fridge to chill while we're putting together our filling and the colder that this crust gets the more stable its going to get so we want to leave it in there for a good probably about 15 minutes before we start filling it but now that our crust is in the fridge and it's getting nice and cold it's time for us to get started with our filling so I have a large bowl here and into that large bowl I have already added four ounces of cream cheese and this is actually light cream cheese because as we know we're very health conscious on this channel two and a half sticks of melted butter pick up one stick of butter 2 cups of sugar into the mix I'm gonna take a mixer and I always like whenever I'm doing something with cream cheese or with butter I actually like to get it blended up a little bit first I think that it makes the cream cheese or butter or whatever you're using blend it with the other ingredients a little bit more easily so I'm just gonna do that right now the other ingredients that we're going to add the first one is going to be a half a can of pumpkin puree now so half a can is going to be about like seven ounces if you're wanting to weigh these types of things if you don't want to weigh it then it's just under a cup if you add in a cup it's not that big of a deal all right so we're going to add in that pumpkin puree and again this is not pumpkin pie filling this is pumpkin of pureed all right so don't get pumpkin pie filling that stuff already has other things inside of it as well as other spices and we don't want any of that because we're going to add all of our own so after the pumpkin puree we're going to start to add in our spices I'm going to add in one teaspoon of cinnamon half of a teaspoon of ginger and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg cloves and allspice at these seasonings that we've added are the same of spices that are inside of a pumpkin pie spice that you can buy at the grocery store so if you don't want to have all of these things inside of your pantry that you could just buy a jar of that and amp up one tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice to this mixture and it will do the same thing next thing we're going to add is a quarter of a cup of powdered sugar and then we're going to take and blend it all together [Music] so you want to get that blended together to be nice and smooth but to make sure that we get it nice and smooth we have to first take and scrape down the edges of our bowl just to make sure that we get anything that was stuck to the sides and then we go in and blend it again all right so that gives us a nice and smooth consistency that you can see and all together that took me about two minutes together okay blending it and scraping down the sides and then blending it again but one thing I actually did forget to add to the mixture before I started blending it together was one teaspoon of vanilla because you know we don't measure vanilla here on this show and then it's really easy to just mix it in without even using the mixer which just goes to show you that even if you make a mistake in a recipe you can always go back and fix it not a big deal now the last ingredient that we want to add into this filling is going to be some whipped topping and again I'm using a light whipped topping again health I'm we're only going to add half of this container of whipped topping into this Victor we're not going to use the whole thing I promise you though we will use the other half later anytime that you're adding something like a whipped cream or whipped topping into a mixture you don't want to lose any of the air that is inside of that whipped topping so we're gonna do a process known as folding where instead of mixing it together really rough where we pop all the air bubbles we're gonna do it up look nice and gently alright so the way that you do this is you go down the center with your spatula and then fold over the top and then go down the center fold over the top and you keep doing that and turning the bowl as you go until eventually you're going to see that there's no white streaks left and you can see that after about 30 seconds of holding you have no more white streets no more dark streets and you have a nice homogeneous mixture which is exactly what you're looking for for good now that our filling is done I grab two our crust from the refrigerator and I'm going to take the filling and place it inside of the crust so I'm just going to take and scrape that in make a nice big mound now you could just move this over with your regular spatula but you guys know that I'm a little bit extra and so I'm going to take an offset spatula and I'm going to spread it out with that just to make sure that my top is nice and smooth so now that our filling is nice and smooth over the top we're going to take this and place it into the fridge just so that the filling can firm up in the fridge and get nice and cold so it's gonna sit in there for about an hour just to make sure that the filling gets nice and firm and sliceable so let's do that the wall ends in the fridge chilling I just want to remind you guys that if you liked this video and you want to make

ideas for future videos you can always leave me a comment down below I love answering your questions and I'm always willing to try new things well I think that our pie is ready so I'm gonna go head over and grab it from the fridge alright so now that this has been chilling in the fridge for about an hour it's time for us to add a topic onto the top so I'm going to be using the rest of the light whipped topping that we use to make the filling a little bit earlier and I'm just going to place it and spread it over the top [Music] so once again I'm going to go in with my offset spatula and I'm just going to gently press the whip topping into the edges of the pie and once again I'm trying to get a nice smooth top [Music] so now that that topping is nice and smooth we're going to just add a little bit of cinnamon to the top just a little sprinkle just to make it a little bit more fancy and that's it the pie is done now that our pie is done it's time to cut out a slice this is always the most nerve-racking this time we take it tastes awesome it has that fantastic pumpkin flavor to it plus you can taste all of the spices that we put in there it really tastes like real-deal pumpkin pie but it didn't take us that long to make and it was pretty easy so I think that's a win well that's all that we have time for here today on the blue is our bass I really hope that you try out this recipe so that you can put the easy back into easy as pie well now it's time for me to go so I'm just gonna grab this and you know find a corner somewhere bye remember you don't have to be a professional chef or a wizard to make a magic and education [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]", "euQJsgUxo34": "how to easy make jalapeno poppers if you're craving your favorite restaurant

most days most weeks it helped me to lose weight I don't need to tell you again I previously lost 40 pounds four years ago and last year I lost 10 pounds I'll tell you why it helped me to lose weight and get healthier because when a meal prep my meals are ready they're ready to go they're already prepared I don't have to try to make healthy food decisions over and over again and then you know when I get lazy and I'm tired after a long day it's easy to make an unhealthy option grab the unhealthy option you know and we're gonna be making enough meals for five days so Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday we're gonna be making breakfast lunch dinner and snacks actually I get my meal prepping done and as little time as possible I've said this to guys before I try to get it done in an hour or just over an hour if I do that on a Sunday or Monday I've got all my meals for the week and it just saves me so much time during the week to get it done in roughly an hour I always start with the ingredient that takes the longest to cook and then we work our way down in that order of things that take the longest to cook to things that are the quickest to cook and then right at the end of this video you'll see all the meals come together really quickly once all of the ingredients are prepped I'll show you how to do it it's so easy so this week of weight loss meal prep is actually from my eBook weight loss meal print for women it was out in January I do actually have a free grocery shopping list download that goes with this video it's for free you guys can go download it on my blog I'll link that below in the description box for you if you want to follow along with this video all the ingredients that you'll need will be on that grocery list and you can just get them and then you can meal perfectly you don't need the e-book to follow through with what I'm gonna show you in this video but this is just one of the weeks in that book just a few of the recipes and there there are four full weeks of meal prep and healthy recipes in my ebook this is just one of the weeks as in my ebook there are also substitutions and alternatives for lots of ingredients that are used there are also gluten dairy free and not free alternatives in the book as well as plant-based and vegan options although in this video I will show you vegan options for anything that's not vegan gluten free and dairy free we'll be making to breakfast options to lunch options to snack options and to dinner options I'm trying to show you guys a lot of variety if you want to reduce cooking time and prepping time even more you can just double up the ingredients of a certain recipe and just make one option for each meal time instead of to this meal plan that I'm going to show you today is based on roughly 1400 calories per day I will show you at the end of this video how you can easily adjust the calories to get 1200 calories 1600 calories or even 1800 calories per day you can easily adjust it to get the calories that you need to lose weight before I forget don't forget to pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit or about 200 degrees Celsius and we can get started I'm slicing up some red bell pepper roughly 300 grams to be exact I'm gonna share exact amounts with you if you want to follow along with that you can a calories sake or four just to get the recipes exact I'm adding those sizes to a baking tray with baking paper and then I've rinsed about 3 cups of cherry tomatoes and I'm adding them to the tray too I'm just adding a quick spray of cooking oil with a regular salt pepper you can place that in the oven for about 20 to 30 minutes and then take it out when it's ready the next step is really simple again we're gonna cook some grains some quinoa and some pasta you're gonna see me make a lot of quinoa and pasta but that's because I'm prepping some extra for Rob to add meals the exact amount you'll need would be about 1 cup of dragging where you can add that to a small pot with about 3 cups of hot water just bring that to a boil on the stove and then you can reduce the heat covered with a lid let it simmer for about 15 minutes and or until it's fully cooked you can add some more water along the way if you need to then for the pasta what I do is bring a large to medium pot of water to a boil on the stove before adding the dry pasta into the boiling water I use brown rice pasta or quinoa pasta you can use any kind you will need about 85 of dry pasta to make about one and a half cups of cooked pasta now we're going to boil some eggs if you want a vegan option do not worry I'll tell you how to use pinto beans instead I'll show you a bit later if you do want to use eggs though like I'm doing you can add a pot of hot water to the stove with six eggs in it just bring the water to a boil on the stove and let it cook for about eight to 10 minutes until it they're hard boiled once they're cooked you can remove the pot from the stove and pour the hot water out what I like to do is rinse the eggs under cold water crack them open a bit and let them sit in the cold water for a few minutes this makes it much easier to peel them and then after a few minutes you can peel the eggs and then set them aside to cool down super easy and yeah we've done a lot already now we're gonna make our first pop a meal we're gonna really get into it we're gonna put together this quick chicken and vegetable stir-fry I will give you a vegan option in a minute I'm using one and a half onions we'll use the other half later for something else I'm just chopping those into strips and adding it to a frying pan with a quick spray of cooking oil toss that on the stove over medium to high heat until the onions start to brown you can add a small amount of water to the pan if it gets too dry to prevent the onion from burning but this is a must because cooking the onion first and just allowing it to brown just a little bit will add a lot of flavor to the meal and then what I'm doing is cutting up some chicken breasts need about 270 grams to be exact into small pieces and adding that to the pan along with the onion if you'd prefer a vegan alternative you can use 1 cup of cooked chickpeas instead of the chicken and you can just toss that into the stir-fry I like to add some onion powder some oregano some salt pepper and then lime or lemon juice for flavor and then I'm using about 300 grams of red bell pepper and about 450 grams of zucchini which we call baby maro in South Africa these measurements aren't totally exact I'm just giving you rough estimations a rough indication of what I've used it doesn't have to be completely exact I'm starting up the ball pepper and the zucchini adding them to the pan once the chicken has started to cook and then you can just cover the pan with a lid tossing it occasionally every few minutes over a medium heat once it's cooked you can remove it from the stove remove from the heat just leave it to cool just make sure that chicken is fully cooked before maybe not from the heat this one that we're gonna put together now is actually my favorite meal from the week I really like it I like all of them but this is my absolute favorite it's so good so I used that one and a half onions for the first recipe now we gonna use the left of a half now so just half an onion chop it into small pieces I'm cooking it on a frying pan with a small amount of cooking oil spray over a medium to high heat until it's lightly browned again same procedure as before then I'm rinsing and slicing some mushrooms and shredding some brussel sprouts into pieces use about 300 grams of mushrooms and about a hundred grams of Brussels sprouts and then add them to the pan with the onion I like to cook the vegetables with pepper and lime and lemon juice over medium heat that keep tossing that covered with a lid I'm not going to add salt to this one though you'll see what what I like to do is drain and rinse the fully cooked lentils I'm using canned lentils and then add them to the pan once the vegetables are almost fully cooked I'm using about one cup of those lentils okay the most important ingredient it's an essential ingredient to this recipe the marinara pesto sauce this is gonna make the entire meal don't skip it I like to use the Rao's homemade marinara sauce you can use any tomato based or any marinara pasta sauce that you prefer I recommend using one that's between 80 to 100 calories per half a cup serving so I'm using about 1 cup of the pasta sauce in total so just toss that occasionally on the stove until it's fully cooked now we're onto something fun we're gonna bake some healthy snack cookies this is one of the quickest cookie recipes that you'll ever make there are not traditional cookies so don't expect that they're their healthy snack cookies that I'd like to make okay so this is important you want to reduce the heat of your oven right now don't forget to do it to about 360 degrees Fahrenheit or about 180 degrees Celsius I'm adding two wrap and on is to a mixing bowl and smashing them up with the back of a fork just roughy the wrap of the bananas are the sweeter the cookies will be you kind of want to use a banana that's got like the little brown spots on it and then you can add 2/3 of a cup of dry rolled oats and also some cinnamon to a ball I use about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon mix that together a bud then I've got about 14 role islands here just being very specific for you but roughly that you can pop them up a bit and add them in and then I'm adding a quarter cup of raisins before mixing again so I've got a baking tray here lined with baking paper I like to grease it with a small amount of coconut oil just a small amount and then I measure out about a heaped tablespoon size of batter at a time adding about it to the baking tray just to make rough cookie shapes you want to make enough cookies to have three equal servings this recipe should make between 15 to 18 cookies or about five to six per serving I was clearly confused when I filmed those because I didn't do that as you can see I did not I made one extra random cookie but it you know it's okay it'll all be okay it's not a big deal so if you do that don't worry it's not the end of the world so once all of your batter has been used up you can bake the cookies for about 20 minutes and then we're onto the next thing we are gonna make an incredible recipe these are toaster pancakes I always start by blending up some whole rolled oats in a blender to make a flour this takes a takes less than a minute or you can use the same amount of oat flour that you already have I use about 2/3 of a cup of dry oats next I'm healing to medium wrap and honors and adding them to a bowl again you want to use the ones that have like the little brown spots on them because they're going to be sweeter and it's gonna make the pancakes taste better I'm adding them to a bowl and smashing them with a fork just roughly you can also just throw everything into a blender it's much quicker but you can also do it in a bowl which is what I'm showing you now just in case you don't have a blender then I'm adding four large eggs mixing them and if you do want a plant-based substitute for the eggs you can make cheer eggs they're really easy to make you can make them in a separate bowl using chia seeds and water and just leave them to soak until the chia seeds have a gel-like consistency before adding them into the blender or the bowl with the other ingredients use four tablespoons of chia seeds and twelve tablespoons of water to make the amount of 40 eggs don't forget to let it soak for 5 minutes before you add it in and then add that oat flour and some cinnamon and once all of the ingredients have been added just blend them together or you can mix it together in the bowl to make the batter so now the batter is ready we're going to heat a pan on the stove and just started at about a medium-high heat and then just adjust the heat as you need to what I recommend doing is using a nonstick frying pan as this it really does make better pancakes you will get much better pancakes you can do a quick spray of cooking oil if you need to add heaped tablespoon amount of powder to the pan to make small medium pancakes I usually make three or four small pancakes at a time in the pan when the pancakes start to bubble on top then they should be ready to flip and when all of the pancakes are ready when they're cooked on both sides you can just add them to a plate to cool them down just keep doing that repeat the process until all of the bad has been used up and you'll have a whole big plate of pre-prepped pancakes what I like to do is to start prepping the next few food items while I continue to flip the pancakes because that's just really the easy jus I can just keep an eye on the pancakes and I can get started with some other easy things you don't want to take on a big task what you do this but we're just going to do some quick things so we're gonna make some smoothie prep we're gonna make some overnight oats and we're gonna make this sandwich filling prep while we finish the pancakes we're actually really close to being done the rest is gonna go very quickly so don't give up just yet I'm opening some black beans and I'm draining and rinsing them you can use black beans that you've cooked yourself or you can use canned ones you'll need about one cup of cooked black beans that's about 170 two grams roughly this is really easy it may seem weird but it's really good so I just spread out the black beans to cover a bowl and smash them with the back of a fork it doesn't have to be perfect just rough and I've got two tablespoons of pre measured out tahini here some fresh lime or lemon juice and adds really great flavor so I do quite a lot of it I'm using about one small lime and some salt and pepper mix that all together I also added some onion powder and some oregano for extra flavor that's it very easy I'm dividing that between two containers which are stored in this is the best thing to have pre prepped in the fridge to make quick sandwiches with so we'll come back to that in a minute or so we're gonna prep some other quick things just leave that aside don't forget to finish flipping your pancakes if you still doing that Ivan and oats is it's literally the easiest meal per breakfast recipe ever you'll need two jars or containers to make and store them in I'm measuring out about half a cup of rolled oats to each one then I'm measuring out about 24 almonds 2 teaspoons of chia seeds half a tablespoon of cocoa powder 1 teaspoon of maple syrup and a pinch of cinnamon to each jar add about half a cup of water to each jar and mix all of the ingredients together with the water and then I just use frozen blueberries because they're cheaper and they taste just as good unless I add half a cup of frozen blueberries to each jar mix it again it is easier if you add the water and then the blueberries not like how I did it in this video it's easier to mix if you add the water first and just cover them and place them in the fridge overnight and that's done now we're making the final thing before we finally put everything together you will see that's when it gets super easy this is my favorite snack smoothie all you need is three ingredients frozen mango pieces milk I use unsweetened almond milk you can use any milk and protein powder I use a dairy-free plant-based protein powder I'm starting with two reusable Ziploc bags and measuring about 1 cup of frozen mango pieces to each one then I'm adding half a scoop of protein powder to each serving so just one scoop in total you can use any protein powder that you like but I recommend using one that's slightly sweetened and flavoured with vanilla if you do want a calorie reference the protein powder that I use is about 110 calories per 31 grams scoop of protein powder and then I'm measuring out about one cup of the almond milk to each container to make two servings you can use any milk of your choice as I said dairy or non-dairy just for a calorie reference again if you do want one I use an unsweetened almond milk which is roughly 30 to 40 calories per cup you can just measure out the milk on the day if you like but you know if you want everything pre-prepped then you can do this and don't forget to add the seblak bags to the freezer and the milk to the fridge if you're going to use reusable Ziploc bags like I'm doing for two you hold some of the ingredients I recommend actually reusing them to avoid plastic waste or you can just use reusable containers I got this bamboo plastic drying rack on Amazon it's really easy to wash it by guard hang it up reuse it you know let it dry round about now is when I you start to get pretty tired and restless and wanting it to be over but we're so close now all that we have to do is put the mills together so this is actually really the easy part and it's like the most satisfying part because you just you just see everything coming together and it feels like really rewarding and then we'll have our meals the whole week you just got to keep thinking about that you'll have your meals for the whole week ready and you'd have to think about cooking again though let's finish putting together we'll have the pancake breakfast the pancakes have cooled down by now we can store them and dividing the pancakes between three containers there's actually quite a few per serving depending on how big or small you you make the pancakes obviously just use the map and so they're all finished and then these will be the toppings for the pancakes I'm measuring out about one tablespoon of peanut butter to each of these three small containers and I've got roughly two cups of fresh strawberries here which I'm making into three servings I'll only rinse the strawberries on the morning that I eat them so they don't go soggy and bad and moldy and stuff in the fridge so for each morning that we're having toaster pancakes which is three mornings we'll have the pancakes the peanut butter and the strawberries you can seal the Ziploc bags cover the containers definitely stole the pancakes and the strawberries in the fridge so that they stay fresh and we're onto the next thing the overnight oats are they're ready for two breakfasts two mornings this week so yeah if you haven't put them in the fridge already just cover them with a lid do that now get them in the fridge and that's that's good to go the black bean and tahini sandwich you might be wondering how this is coming together we're going to finish prepping those right now you can use any bread that is roughly 100 calories per slice just roughly that amount these are the two brands that are sometimes use this genuine Bavarian sunflower seed rye bread or the gluten-free ancient grains one from three bakers you can use any bread that you prefer though if you want to use a gluten-free one then do that now we're making enough for two lunches so we're putting together two servings of two slices of bread each then I'm putting some cherry tomatoes and some leafy greens into small support bags I've just used two cherry tomatoes for each serving and I know the seems ridiculous you'll see why when I show you how to put the meal together I only use a very small amount of leafy greens you can use mixed greens a regular rocket spinach whatever you want I'm just using mixed greens so for each day that we'll be having the black bean and tahini sandwiches you'll have the black bean and tahini spread you'll have the bread and the salad ingredients just make sure everything's covered sealed with airtight containers stored in the fridge I keep the bread in the fridge that's just my personal preference and we're finishing up lunch to you guys see how quickly this is going out at the end it's the best the ball is rolling so to start we're using the rest of the mixed greens I'm dividing that between three Ziploc bags so you want it nice amount because we're making a salad then we've got the boiled eggs which we already peeled and we've left them to cool down so they're cool now we can I like to leave them whole so that they stay fresher for longer and I'm putting two eggs into each of the three containers to store them as a plant-based or vegan alternative to the eggs you can use pinto beans in the salad just drain and rinse the beans straight from the can you can store them in an airtight container with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to keep them fresh and when you're ready to eat the salad just toss the pinto beans in with the other ingredients you can substitute 6 large eggs for about 2 cups of cooked and drained pinto beans so divide that between three this is a topping for the salad I'm using 3 tablespoons of sunflower seeds I'm adding a tablespoon to each of these 3 containers and you can also use pumpkin seeds if you don't have or don't like sunflower seeds now I'm going to show you how to make this very quick easy salad dressing and this is the one of the last things we're making so it all goes really fast from here I've got 3 small containers I'm squeezing the juice from 2 limes here between the three containers and then I'm actually using some rice vinegar you can use you can use however much you like or any vinegar that you like to use on salads use somewhere between one teaspoon and one tablespoon per container I actually like to use one tablespoon per serving and then some salt and pepper mix it up and cover each dressing with a lid and then the roasted vegetables and the quinoa they're both ready I've got another three containers here and I'm serving half a cup of cooked quinoa to each one I'm still going to use some of the quinoa for one of the dinners and I've made a lot of extra quinoa for Rob he'll eat and then just serve all of the vegetables are between three containers just get them into the same container as quinoa if you want to they look amazing that first of vegetables so for each one of these lunch salads you'll have a serving of the quinoa and the vegetables you'll have to boil eggs the leafy greens the salad dressing and the sunflower seeds as a topping so that's everything in total for three lunches cover all of the containers with lids seal the airtight bag store everything in the fridge for mealtime from here it's really easier than you could ever imagine everything's actually already finished so snack one is already finished so let's work for you less work for me right now at each snack time where you're going to have those protein smoothie you'll have one of the mango and protein powder packets and one serving of the milk so in total you'll have two of each of those stole the mango and protein powder packets in the freezer and keep the milk in the fridge I bet you're wondering what happened to these cookies I was actually starting to wonder it's been a while since we sold them but after 20 minutes in the oven I took them out let them cool down on the side Rob helped himself to one as you can see you don't often see him in my videos but you sometimes get to see what he eats as I said earlier you want to make enough cookies to have three equal servings that's not a train smash if it's not you know whatever anyway Rob wanted one he was hovering around when I was bringing the cookies out and so he got to have one and we've got three equals that means now so so the cookies between three containers or whatever you're gonna store them in and that's a yummy healthy snack that I will be looking forward to Jenna we're on dinner we're weird but we're basically done now so hang in there we're so close we're literally done with everything we just serving out the last two meals the stir-fry is done so I'm serving it out between three containers to make three portions and if you watch a lot of my videos you knew a big mess was coming at some point so we've got that out the way now I'm serving half a cup off the cook quinoa to each one of these three containers and then I'll have I'll have some olives a lot of olives I'm using kalamata olives you can use roughly ten olives per serving that's about 30 in total you can keep those in small containers or just serve them out on the day up to you that's it for each of these three dinners you'll have the chicken and vegetable stir-fry you'll have the quinoa and you'll have cover all of those things up and get the get everything into the fridge and dinner too my favorite one best for last the brown rice pasta with marinara sauce that's good lentils and mushrooms and brussel sprouts in it this is my favorite thing so we're just serving this out the marinara sauce with the lentils the mushrooms the Brussels sprouts so there are between two containers to make two portions and then the pasta is ready you can serve about 3/4 of a cup into each of these two containers I've made lots of it to have leftover for Rob and that is it we are done we have finally done just cover all of the containers with a tidelands remember to put everything away in the fridge or the freezer with that we are done it feels really good as you put everything away in the fridge and clean up the kitchen which is not a mess I'm really glad that I stuck to it and I finished it I'm always so glad and then you know it just feels great this is Snowie my pile of a metallic let's get to the next part I am going to show you how to put everything together on the day that you eat it the reason I call these pancakes toaster pancakes is because I heat them up in the toaster when a meal prep them this is life-changing if you're a pancake lover so I take one of the pancakes soybeans out of the fridge and place one or two pancakes into each slot of the toaster at a time just watch them so they don't burn they heat up quite quickly actually in the toaster and then on the morning that I eat them I rinse and sauce up the serving the strawberries and add them as a topping on top of the pancakes drizzle the peanut butter on top of that and that is how you can have healthy pancakes for breakfast every single morning and two minutes when you want to eat the overnight oats just take one of them out of the fridge and you can eat it straight out of the job with a spoon if you like you can take the jar or the container to work or school with you or you can serve it in a bowl like I'm doing you can heat it up really quickly in a saucepan on the stove if you like to eat it warm I just eat it cold I actually like it like that I topped this one with a few fresh blueberries as you can see this is a really low calorie fruit and it won't add too many calories if you're concerned about that but I would generally just eat them as they are this lunch sandwich is really easy to put together it takes two minutes you can do it in the morning before school or work or you can just make it at lunchtime if you're working or studying from home so I get the bread on a plate as you can see I actually like to toast the Lackey before I eat it and then I add the black bean and tahini spread on top you can make an open or closed sandwich whatever you like and then I'm adding some of those leafy greens on top and now for those two cherry tomatoes I'm slicing them up and adding them on top it's just a sandwich topping or sandwich filling which is why we only need a two cherry tomatoes per sandwich and that's good to go I love this recipe I've made it so many times it's filling it's nutritious that's great for this lunch we've got quite a few containers and things here but it's also really easy to put together on the day just grab a plate or a bowl if you'll be putting this together at lunch time at home or you can grab a bigger container tutorial into if you want to take those to school or work for later I'm adding the roasted vegetables in the quinoa to a plate with the leafy greens I'm starting up the boiled eggs and adding them on top and then sprinkle the sunflower seeds on top and lastly I'm adding the dressing drizzling that over and that's very easy and you can enjoy a pretty fancy looking lunch that took practically no time to put together that day to put together this mango protein smoothie it's again very easy you can grab your mango and protein powder pack out of the freezer and just add it to a blender with the one cup of the milk I'm using my nutribullet you can use any blender and just serve it into a glass it's a really great pre or post-workout snack if you need a little pick-me-up it's very refreshing and the snack cookies they really don't require any further effort as you can see they're ready to go you can just grab them enjoy your snack wherever you are and you know you you can take these to school work with you wherever you're going or you can just enjoy them at home at your desk while you're working or studying and you need a little extra energy a little little snack for the chicken and vegetable stir-fry you can easily heat up the quinoa and the stir-fry together in a frying pan on the stove sometimes I do that it's very quick and easy or you can heat up everything in the microwave you can heat up the quinoa and the chicken and vegetable stir-fry in the microwave or even in the oven just make sure that your containers are microwave or oven safe just don't overcook them or burn them when you heat them up and the chicken and everything will get really dry and you can serve them onto a plate with the olives and you're ready to eat takes two minutes and the final thing the brown rice pasta with marinara sauce and the lentils and the vegetables I heat this dinner up the same way that I do the previously one you can either heat it up together the pasta and the the saucy vegetables together and a frying pan on the stove very quick and easy to do you can just pass them around there till the heated or you can just heat them up in the microwave and serve them on a plate just make sure your containers are microwave safe if you're going to do that please keep in mind that we're all different like I'm

sandwiches and the on the cauliflower thins yep keto turkey sandwiches yeah amazing let's just fall out of the package making her own sandwich she's never buy the fridge so she's having a great time and then another thing that we eat all the time is the sauerkraut yeah and rose loves it too it's great to introduce that to little ones as well i started introducing this to rose when she was about like about 10 months old or so it's fermented though that's that's that's that's the best fermented naturally fermented sauerkraut very important just salt and cabbage that's it so you gotta watch out for that don't get the ones that are shelf stable because they have vinegar in them okay well uh i think bobby wants to take it over from here hey rose i'm actually gonna start with the almond milk because if you can see this almond milk it's super rich and creamy and i talk about this all the time you really want to avoid the almond milk with all the gums and emulsifiers and gels elmhurst from thrive market and the thrive market brand are two of my favorite shelf stable ones that i use for smoothies all the time this has no emulsifiers this only has one most in the grocery store have three to four and they're vitamin fortified those are fantastic because they have four to five times the amount of almonds per cup than like a silk or one you find at the grocery store load up on that when you click my link down below for 25 off your first thrive order get the almond milk either elmhurst or thrive market is fantastic jesse talked about putting the pecan butter on toast we're literally eating this every day it's a little bit of a healthy habit right but this keto bread from base culture a florida based woman-owned company cinnamon raisin and cheese bread you always always see me talk about the ones you don't want to get in the store this is the kind you want to get i mean these ingredients are amazing no process no refined oils no gluten no wheat the ingredients the macros this is fantastic now it's a whoa chug-a-lug duggy it's a little pricey i think i do have a 20 off uh flav city uh promo code on their website filler up barkeep rose isn't joking here it is saturday afternoon it is saturday after all okay um also in here what i love siete makes the most amazing paleo burritos bigger than rose's head but normally burritos are made from wheat and gluten these are once again paleo cause they're cassava flour based but avocado oil the key is you have to heat these in a very large comal or like a cast iron pan how good are those burritos we're making lately we're making breakfast burritos that are too legit to quit they're just absolutely fantastic um what else is in here so this is in here we're going to a barbecue this afternoon this is what i'm calling the best pastries slow grown heirloom heritage breed want that bread roast chicken on the market and it's the thrive market pasture raised box this is pasture raised cook's venture chicken and heirloom or pasture raise is good but heirloom slow grown is even better i'm telling you the texture and flavor of this chicken now breasts are great but i have the whole um spatchcock chicken and i have um the chicken uh wings is amazing i've been talking about them so much they're sold out currently on their website but go on their site click remind me like carrie underwood remind me when that chicken box comes in stock it's about 770 a pound but with 25 off using my promo link down below it's under six dollars a pound every fan who's tried that has literally gone loco and la cabeza they love it okay nana here okay next course for rose here we go there you go sweetie yes yes [Music] tortillas nuts what else real quickly in here this is such an underrated condiment people don't know about harissa theresa is a north african pepper spread and mina is such a cool company look at these ingredients it's actually made with extra virgin olive oil i talk about it in my new cookbook because it's a great store-bought ingredient and we do tons of stuff with that she was just storing her almond milk in the little cubby hole in the fridge right here now she's coming back to it oh my god rose you are hilarious um and that's about it for the fridge let's go to the freezer real quick rose okay in the freezer i gotta clean up after rose here but this is honestly one of the most life-changing ice creams in the world and it's dairy free it's coconut bliss i got it it's sprouts and for some reason it's so hard to find but sprouts farmers market has it this is coconut bliss what is this chocolate walnut brownie but this one's even better this is chocolate peanut butter with the crazy face on the front look at these ingredients okay it's a little expensive it's about seven dollars a pint but best in class ingredients one of the only ice creams that don't use natural flavors and it's only 12 grams of added sugar per serving most ice cream steps here are like ice cream speaking of speaking of ice cream most ice creams are about this actually only has 2 grams of added are 18 to 20. this is not a moo which is not bad but coconut bliss is where it's at um here's what i was talking about this is the pasture raised thrive market chicken spatchcock meaning the bone the backbone is removed you can put the whole thing on the grill or oven crispy skin for the win this is amazing so make sure to uh get that using my link down below and uh i did try the thrive market 100 grass-fed um steak box didn't love it to be honest but it is very high quality and what else is here oh i keep this always in the freezer this is pre-cooked frozen organic brown rice it's nice because it's already cooked so at a moment's notice you can have brown rice which normally takes about 45 minutes to cook you can have this and if you make a stir-fry or fried rice with this it's actually better than fresh rice because this is a bit dry and it will soak up and absorb the flavors of the pan when you cook in there um so that's what's in there rose let's do a check in with rose here rose how's the ice cream is it good and then last but not least over here does we installed this this week and tons of people are asking about it um this is our under counter reverse osmosis alkaline water filter so it's a three stage reverse osmosis but then it has alkaline minerals in here and it alkalizes the water to a 9 ph we're very big on that and then a lot of people keep asking me where to get it the thing is it's from a tiny shop in venice beach called um better water company it's very hard to like you can't even order online so i'm going to try to find one online that's just as good as this because this is fantastic and the water is so clean and has that nice alkaline balance a lot of people are asking about that um and i think that's it so that's what's in our fridge in our freezer right now um scoop that but also like i said this brand right here a lot of people asked when i showed the other day this a cure makes a super clean in the world of cosmetics it's very dirty conditioner and shampoo at whole foods it's 9.99 on thrivemarket.com it's 6.99 i think you're done with ice cream rose and we're done with the video that's what's in the pantry i'm sorry in the fridge and the freezer right now um we did have ice cream now it's a little less but that's actually very low in sugar

going to how these baby Howdy's now my American not British shall we say viewers probably will not know how d you would if you're from Germany because that's it's a German cheaper shop over here now but they've got bigger and bigger and bigger and a lot more people go there and they are the best for gluten free they are the best so they're a mini supermarket chain here in the UK but growing very fast probably been voted the UK best supermarket or the last tool through user record saying gluten free though it doesn't actually state on this particular packaging that it is gluten free the ingredients guys are milk chocolate coating sugar cocoa butter whole milk powder cocoa mass white powder which tells me that it probably is gluten free and vanilla flavoring and obviously rice it does say though it's only suitable for vegetarians there we go vegetarian but doesn't state if it's actually gluten-free for my celiac the viewers out there and the girlfriend so I was a bit disappointed in that so I went on to a website I'll just put in harvest more rice cakes milk chocolate are they gluten free and they come up with the this website celiac Society of Ireland Republic of Ireland I'll put the link in the description below and on here it there's a lady here we've seen that disease wanted to try these and it states and she's put on there they're the only states that it's suitable for vegetarians and we don't actually know what's gluten free loads of people have come back and said they are gluten free but what I will say is from the ingredient I would say that we've been rising that that they are gluten free but we can't suspect lyc\u00e9e 100% until we have someone from from harvest more and actually say that they are gluten-free if you guys do know anything different and know that these are definitely gluten-free then I'll put gluten-free on it but I'm not gonna say they definitely are and so I know but I will wait for a response on this celiac Society of Ireland websites and I'll look at loads more celiac websites but because our these aren't huge and this is like one of their own sort of Manx it's that they're not going to be top of people looking to see if they're gluten free or not but I will try I will keep continue to try but we do know that they are vegetarian so but I'm guessing they're going to be gluten for it I'm guessing but after I won't say they definitely are just in case they're not I don't really want to be you know making these guys heal so in this we have three packs of three what we get so they look really nice really nice indeed it looks like a big milk chocolate biscuit donate look at that oh I'm quite I'm call it before word to this now milk chocolate all over it as well so deftly vegetarian hopefully gluten free I'm 99% sure that he will be we're gonna try a make some milk chocolate biscuits or milk chocolate cake or milk chocolate rice cakes so we'll do a review on on a cake we'll do a review on a gluten free chocolate biscuit and then we'll decide on which one we want to recreate so that's it's quite a big guys it's quite good okay that it's looking good all that rise anything put quite a bit there definitely bigger than I thought I thought they were gonna be rectangular anyway oh it smells very chocolatey anyway I hope this is gluten free for you guys so here we go moist mountain here we go hmm that thanks gorgeous the chocolate makes it but the rice the rice cake bit at the bottom it's country country crunchy flavorful that's really good guys really really good like I say to come in packs of three so you take that to Luxuria honey lunch box and you get three packs in there so you get knowing basically that 150 grams and a 30 category 30 30 calories per one I need to put me teeth back in there not seriously hmm guys they are beautiful that is definitely definitely a king guys picks up down around these Saudis Roy's page bloggers say I'm the Roth or something in the future we also get a response from this celiac Society of Ireland or if I do find out any other way or unless you guys know if these are definitely gluten free I'm 90 99 percent sure that they are and like I said this lady wants to know as well so in getting touch with this lady and see if she's found out anymore so yeah these guys for this one pack so you get nine in this pack from Audi's he's one pound 35 very very cheap very very nice after King I can't wait for the gluten-free cake and I can't wait for the gluten-free biscuits just stay tuned for that I'll try them and then we'll recreate them what it's Chris to the best one see you later guys and so watch him bye", "2iBSu_5Pu2g": "hey everybody surrogates stone here today I'm going to do a cannabis review on Oklahoma's on marrying mechanics brand they threw me a half gram green crack cartridge to try so we're gonna check it out today um overall my first opinion on it is that it's packaged very nice it's very appealing I love how they put that it's a sativa on here and the name of the stream I like how they have all the percentages on the back and they let you know all what's in the cart that says it's a ninety one point nine eight percent THC and zero point eight three percent CBB um unfortunately they did not have a matching battery to go with this cart so I'm going to use my own battery today but it is a universal 510 thread so it should fit on most standard batteries it's easy to open but still childproof I got my my battery here and it's already turned on I'm already preheated my battery so you guys may want to pre-heat your batteries and I was told that the marry mechanics doesn't need too high of a heat on your battery setting but I'd like to set him up for hot with these carts make sure they don't pop or clog on me okay sorry I have applied this marry mechanics cart on to my battery I'm going to take my very first hit of green crack sativa by marrying mechanics so first thoughts and opinions that it's way stronger than I thought it would mean mm-hmm it hits very smoothly hmm you would definitely not need to set this a high heat setting maybe a medium to low the velocity of the car is somewhat thick but still moveable I didn't experience any clogs which is great because other brands I've tried they've instantly clogged first hit not even getting anything so I love that my medicine was dispensed appropriately um I had a good flavor profiling - it was sweet yet earthy it's really smooth I can already feel some effects just after two hits yeah I feel instant relaxation calming on my nerves and anxieties and my quads were a little sore before I started this video I did some exercises this morning my legs are kind of sore from that I just made me kind of sluggish and not wanting to do anything today but I'm already feeling the effects of this sativa I'm ready to get up and go start doing other things with my day than make videos um overall marry mechanics green crack half-grams sativa cart I would totally give a 4 point 8 out of 5 stars I'm only gonna give the point two off because I felt that the taste wasn't necessarily what I'm looking for I could sense that there was a terpene profile in there but I don't think it's necessarily terpenes that my body craves and enjoy so I was just a personal thing um so it's really close to five stars I really enjoy it I love that the picasa d is not too thick and that the car hit real smoothly didn't clog on me the medicine was dispersed smoothly and evenly and I love that I don't have to hit the cart too many times to start feeling relief and effects of the pin so I really like it so once again marry mechanics cannabis thank you again for giving bed tender surrogates stoned sample for reviewing and I definitely recommend this product for patients that are looking for mild pain relief and energy something that will motivate you to move beyond past your pain I think that this would be a good product recommendation for you so thanks again for tuning in to my channel you guys and have an awesome day", "cdmNSgKaxdw": "alright today I'm gonna make this Heath milk-chocolate English toffee bar premium dessert bar next makes an email a pain which I have here 110 calories for one sixteenth of the package so if you make cutting 1/16 squares then it makes its 110 calories that's the mix along which is completely stupid prepared it's a hundred fifty calories for one sixteen so I don't want to give you that it's not like you're going to eat this by itself what you need is you need three tablespoons of butter to melt it which I already have in the bowl mostly melted in one egg and that's for just the beta mix and then for the chocolate frosting you need another two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of milk which I'll get at the tone you heat your oven to 350 which I already have it's already preheating and probably already preheated by now I greets the bottom of this pan I just use cooking spray and spray right there and just spray the bottom of the pan just to lubricate a little stick so we're going to stir the bar mix the three tablespoons of melted butter and eggs until a soft dough forms oh by the way we got this admirer and it was 246 at Meijer so yeah big selling pretty much everywhere and they also have these a Reese's version and a Hershey smaller version too and we have the Reese's version we're going to do in another video in this one the s'mores I've seen that we have to do so I'm assuming I'm just going to do the the yeah we're not going to do that we're just gonna do that and fifth or necks right there is no notice that yeah just to make sure you get the right one we're late the bar mix the butter and the egg that way I can throw my eggshell in and we are actually using butter butter not margarine it's actually real butter yeah we're just gonna mix this up until a soft dough forms break egg make sure your butter this will I do I smash it just like I waited for the with a cookie mix paint cuts I mash it with the back of your spoon it tends to get all the butter squished let's get rid of stir it hit the add a mixer you can we cook Nixon good that looks pretty good so it says take this and put it press evenly in paint it smells good it feels like my head the texture like brown sugar like the grainy texture of brown sugar that's what it feels like yeah thin bar unless it rises it might very well Roz okay and then what you do is you take I don't know if I can get it out for my sticky fingers but we're gonna take I think let me wash my hands when I can move that study back all right got my hands wash sorry if I actually sprayed my hands with cooking spray which has been easier but so what we're going to do is you take half of this it says about two tablespoons of the toffee mix over the the top I'm just gonna guess to me make sure that way I won't over yeah that's back so I'm just gonna sprinkle these over the top and once you get these sprinkled on top what you're going to do is you're going to bake it as directed and for this size pan this is an 8 8 by 8 pan it's going to go 19 to 22 minutes so we'll put it in 19 out to see if it's ready and pull out this is baked into its golden brown and then you let it cool completely don't you don't want it to be more scuzz than all your frostings gonna melt so I'm gonna give this I was corrected by Tammy this is a 9 by 9 pan not a mate made it actually says it on the bottom you won't be able to see it but anyway it's on the bottom printed on the bottom it's a 9 by 9 so 9 by 9 pain is 15 to 18 minutes so so I'll put in there 15 and then I'll check it it's home I'll be back ok here it is out of the oven and focus focus there it is you can see the little toffee bits kind of melted into it and it did fries lose like it rose a little bit but anyway that's what it looks like that's the golden brown they're looking for is actually in more like 17 minutes so and it probably could have 15 min we wanted a little bit browner so it up in there 17 and it looks like this so we're gonna let it cool off completely but while it's cooling I'll be mixing up the chocolate frosting okay I'm gonna mix the frosting and now get the frosting mix right here I get stick to it and cut that it gets into it again I've got a the two teaspoons or two tablespoons of butter it's been softening in this bowl you can see it's soft drop this round top of it and then it needs 2 tablespoons of milk that's about it for this without my gonna have two tables with all right okay and then I've just gotta I'm just going to use a hand mixer I didn't want to get my big mixer out for this I just got a hand mixer with with beaters on here hopefully I'll stir it up a hand this purse I got that seems silly but if I turn it on with all that powder in there I'm gonna make a little cloud Pazuzu do anyway 1 3 4 30 seconds and there's high for merit and you are gonna clean the print out of it I'm gonna same Tammy sped that up if she leaves it in there at all you have to do it for a minute and I know it seems like a really long time because Tammy sitting there going it's because she wants a trial bite and she's impatient you have to do it for a minute because she's like fluffy not thick and goopy set actually see how fluffy it is almost like whipped cream you so I'm just gonna spread this all over it has the consistency of like a mousse now not a mousse mousse is a little thick this is more like a whipped cream they take your remaining coffee pieces and we're just gonna sprinkle on top it's ready to cut so let me clean up here a little bit and then we'll get a knife and cut it out and be back to let you know it tastes like okay where I sit down this is how it looks up close hopefully you can see that but we haven't tried it yet and our pan I was able to cut it in 16 pieces so this is the serving size look at cookie on the bomb no sorry living for bugs as more above chief level mm-hmm I get the toffee pieces though those were really good I like those toffee phases and their chocolate frosting it still just tastes like a cookie it was some toffee pieces out it really is it's good don't get me wrong it's really good very sweet I don't know that it's worth whatever we paid for I know I just don't know that it's worth the time and effort and I hate to say that it's not as Wow that's a really good flavor you know what I think would've been it for me is if they had used like regular chocolate frosting instead of having you whip this thing up to where it was an edge chocolaty tasting that's true or if they'd had talked of just a chocolate patches right yeah to make it true chocolate instead of this whipped because it's good but it's not nearly as sweet it's just a regular milk chocolate frosting would have I think that's where maybe they lost me so if they had I had milk chocolate and like you said squirt it on there and they don't the coffee pieces yeah that would have been really good and it's good there's nothing wrong with them I probably probably won't bomb again I'll make them or anything like that just because the taste wasn't that overwhelming especially since it was supposed to be heath bar right and you do get the toffee but but overall it's just a cookie right so anyway hopefully you enjoyed this video I know that no one requested this one but I figured someone had requested the racist bars which we plan on making those very soon so hopefully you enjoyed this one too and thanks for watching", "B0OJPOYMTRQ": "Put all of the powder in it then sieve it. sieve it again to mix evenly. Chopped it a little. Stir well the room temperature butter. Add sugar and salt, stir for a little (about 2 minutes). Mix well with butter. (Don't need too much mix it.) Add vanilla bean paste and mix it. Put all the powder in a bowl, Mix it gently using spatula. Put the rest of the ingredients and complete the dough. Do not knead to long time, and when the cookie wiil de a lump, finish it. Place the cookie dough on a paper foil Sprinkle the powder and shape it into a cylinder shape.

Enjoy it with home baking :)", "TGhxf7MO4Js": "hey guys what's up finally got a video coming up right now definitely something a little bit different than what you'd be used to but a pretty cool food review nonetheless and the main reason videos have been coming up is because I haven't had a tripod I haven't had a few things going on right that just really weren't making quality videos cuz I did actually make a Mik rap video and I haven't already reviewed the bacon cheddar burger from Burger King and both of those on the computer they're just not edited because they really didn't turn out right and I didn't want to throw up another shitty little video just to get one up I actually wanted a decent video so I'm most likely gonna refill those and get them uploaded soon so stick around for that but as for today I just got my tripod and setup for my phone and at that same time I got that package this package also loop gain which is McVitie's jaffa cake so now for someone who's never heard of that I could understand because these come all the way from the UK as with nowadays you can buy pretty much anything off the internet and get it to you so sure enough this actually came all the way from the UK and I honestly never heard of them before until I saw a video on the sordid Food Channel really cool guys check them out link down below they did their own video on how to make these now these are a UK staple these are something that you know every UK kid would get in their lunchbox or you know they know about them and it's a great treat me personally they look pretty interesting and they sounded delicious and what they are exactly is McVitie's jaffa cakes the original blend of dark crackly chocolate light sponge and a smashing orange bit and not only is that nothing sounding like american marketing i mean you could tell just by the package alone the way you know everything obviously in grams kilograms and you know one two three four healthy ballots eat healthy snacks are great for you suitable for vegetarians store in a cool dry place we'll get into that in just a moment and then we got a all the ingredients right here not too bad we got 12 light sponge cakes with darker crackly chocolate and smashing orange center overall pretty decent packaging pretty small but obviously a little light cardboard it's made for being inside of you know obviously a grocery store or something like that these coming all the way from the UK me living in a little town and areas the jaffa cakes themselves got a little bit beat up I actually have them in the fridge right now cooling down so the chocolates not melting everywhere so I'm not gonna let better affect the review for the cinema fact that it traveled all the way across the world and sat in the mailbox per day and like 90 degree weather besides that let's go ahead and get those and check them out all right so I got them out of the fridge and they harden up a little bit but honestly it wasn't enough to save them being that there is jelly and chocolate together it kind of just sandwiched and stuck them all together and I tried separating them but there's no real look of actually getting one out by itself so I'm gonna just go ahead and might kind of show you what we got going on here as you can see each one is a little cake and then we got a layer of gelatin like a little gelatin orange disc cover with nice dark chocolate as you can see there's the orange disc right there chocolate cake still gonna taste great I might as well take a bite and just see how it tastes so for my first product that I personally bought and got from another country I'm pretty pleased with the results now honestly all looks aside going completely on taste for this review obviously this is about the best I could do to get an individual jaffa cake as you can see it's they're not the biggest thing but honestly if you have an individual one and you eat it the way you're supposed to starting you know from the bottom to the top you get it a nice layer of flavors you get a little bit of light airy sponge cake on the bottom not too much flavor coming from that then you get this gelatin disk of like orange deliciousness and finishing off with a nice little dark chocolate bite on top it's a perfectly great combination and I think it deserves a easy 9 out of 10 and it definitely doesn't taste this processed is some of the foods here in America man keeping the gelatin like most gelatin that I eat like you know gummy bears gummy wearing those things like that here in America have this really weird artificial flavor taste and it's made me really stopped liking gummies now this gummy inside here is like a see-through gelatin and it just tastes like a sweet gummy there's no like weird artificial taste it has a nice strong orange bite to it closest thing that I could resemble would be like those orange chocolate oranges that you just smash you know and you get a little piece and a piece that's exactly what that tastes like and it's absolutely delicious but I figured I'd just try and review something different and give a quick test out on my new tripod and make sure everything worked right and I think I couldn't have picked a better thing to review but thanks for watching guys plenty more videos coming now but I got my setup all fixed let me know what you guys want to see I'd love to make it happen thanks for watching I'll see you in the next one", "7CwkydXAV6o": "[Music] today I'm going to show you how to make these peanut butter and ham heart cookies okay so what you're gonna need is 1/2 cup of natural peanut butter at room temperature so no sugar added basically a 1 large egg 1/2 cup of the hemp parts which are just shelled hemp seeds 1/4 cup of granular sweetener of choice you can use erythritol or I'm using the stevia blend here 1/4 TSP of baking powder 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and then you need 1/2 cup of sugar free chocolate chips now I'm a hard time finding those where I live so I just buy a sugar-free chocolate bar and chop it up myself ok so I've got the oven preheating to 350 Fahrenheit which should be about 180 Celsius and then you're going to want to line your baking sheet with baking paper or parchment paper um if you've got a large sheet like this otherwise you might need to smaller pans so to start with in a large bowl you're going to put your egg and we'll add the peanut butter just use a whisk to combine those now once that's combined add your hemp arts sweetener baking powder and vanilla mix that together with a wooden spoon yeah it just says to fold in your chocolate chips remember mine are a little bit bigger because I had to cut them by hand than your normal chip size so now for this you can use a cookie scoop or if you haven't got that just as Onis fine a good sized tablespoon you want to get 12 balls out of this all up so I just kind of divided my dough in half and then in half again and out of each quarter I'm getting about three so I'm just going to go ahead and scoop it a little bit and place that on the pan we want these about two inches apart now you just want to flatten them slightly now you can use a fork on the back of your spoon and the dough may stick a little bit that's all right you just want to flatten out a little bit so now I'm just gonna pop those in the preheated oven you want to cook them about 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown and slightly firm to the touch that's been almost 14 minutes [Applause] getting golden-brown for sure so I'm gonna go ahead and pull those out now it's probably gonna be the hardest part you need to leave those sit and cool in the pan for about 10 minutes otherwise they're going to fall apart if you pick them up they are peanut butter hemp heart cookies or chocolate chip peanut butter hemp heart cookies actually they're really quite good I did notice they continued to brown a little bit even after I took them out of the oven so it says 12 to 14 minutes I went almost 14 um next time I think I'll take them out of 12 but otherwise they're really quite good I hope you enjoy them [Music]",

Please check well :) For a clean cross section, first cut to the middle with a saw knife Use the knife to cut the rest part If you use only a knife, the whole almonds are not cut well, so the dough is crushed and brittle If you use only a saw knife, the bottom part is not cut cleanly, and there is a lot of crumbs So I used two knives for a clean cross section Put the biscotti on a pan then bake it secondary to crunchy Bake twice, crunchy biscotti It is savory and delicious even if you eat it as it is It's fantastic when you eat it dip with espresso You can't stop to eat it, even you can eat 5-6 biscotti at one time.

Laura starting from the very beginning come join on my challenge let's go hi everyone my name is Brooke and I'll continue 215 40 48 yeah some day of my Challenger I'm gonna try a really interesting recipe for me I love such kinds of days where I'm trying recipes which I basically have no idea what I'm going to try and it's soft weight sausage sausage stuffing yeah I believe destiny I get such a weird name for me I would think when I read it when I resonate that it will be a recipe like literally to make the sausage mix like basically your homemade sausages clearly that's not the thing is America so we don't really stop so it's like chicken or turkey we don't really cook turkey that much my family tried the whole burg and saw the whole bird when I cooked it for the very first time on the challenge of mine so yeah like sausage stuffing I don't know I'm really curious to see how it will be though looking at the ingredients I'm waiting for something really yummy so bread kind of where I don't know anything it was a really really new for me and I'm quite familiar with cultures of three countries Lavinia well I shouldn't say quite familiar with Alexis Turkey and Iran because I'm residing mostly in these three countries for the past five years or so it's mainly in Iran and then sometimes in little anarchy I was getting so sidetracked even though I know this engine will be so long so bracers for that reason I have these here if you want to just click ahead and go watch the actual recipe but before that and I am treating this challenge of mine and this challenge Channel and these intros is kind of like little entries of diary almost exposed wise because I am trying every single recipe for the first time some this I have more ideas about what's to come sometimes it's really interesting to just look back and see what I was thinking going into something and how it ended up so also I want to mention a couple of things and then just like share some thoughts which are already doing excuse me excuse for my Japanese I just had a cup of coffee and I feel like you know sharing my thoughts with you so the first thing I wanted to mention is the actual Italian turkey sausage if you'd be with me for a while then you know that I don't really find like meat raw meat kind of sausages in Iran and whenever I had something like that come up in the recipe I was usually skidding them less usually I was giving them until one day it was it just dawned on me away you can actually make it yourself so as that was I did for today's recipe especially because you're supposed to take all this meat from these sausages and like remove the links and use just the meat inside those just perfect so if you also cannot find like meat sausages or this particular one Italian turkey sausage that I will leave all themes like measurements of all these different ingredients actually spices I used for this mix so you can check it out and I can throw in the link where I'm trying it for the first time just you know for the heck of it the other thing it was mention is poultry seasoning now recently I've come to turn that I'm a spices junky I have so many spices it's ridiculous but I just somehow love love it so much I open my spices like for the drawer how do you call it again good even own it open the door and altima wait what it what isn't call now I cannot remember the name hmm like cupboard cupboard doors so I open the door and it's like so crazy is all full actually to the extended I actually needed to move away some spices to some other places just because they weren't sitting there and it's really funny having in mind that I say maybe three-quarters or like maybe two-thirds of my spices are already in another country not here with me and the fact that I could make not only poaching seasoning of bust Italian turkeys sausage mix from there like spices I have you can really surprise and when you look in the written recipe and see just how many spices there are in these mixes I think you will understand why so anyways I made the poultry seasoning blend myself as well just because as I mentioned I have so many spices I really don't see the point in buying like ready mixes so if you are like me and love spices and lots of spices just check the written recipe so you could see what spices you could use to make your own Portuguese in England and the last thing I promised which I wanted to share with you it's kind of funny okay how to say this this recipe calls for stale bread but for the amount which normally I don't think you would find at home just because you know Freddie something you use daily and even though you might have some like little pieces here and there of stale bread you won't have the amount you need for this recipe like you know at once so you actually have to make this mindful conscious decision to go buy bread and make it scale so it was really funny for me when I was going to him to kill my husband to the bakery to buy fresh bread so that I could make it old so how much is so funny to me so this actually being everything I wanted to mention so now let's go over the ingredients and let's get started we're gonna need three links of Italian turkey sausage links remove do you remember two grams of stale bread cut into two and a half centimeter cube 600 milliliters of chicken stock oh one large onion chopped 4 red bell pepper chopped 3 stalks of celery chopped alone 2 clove of garlic minced 30 grams of butter divided into 16 and 15 grams one and a half tablespoon of olive oil 1 tablespoon of poultry seasoning salt and pepper I have my largest nonstick skillet here the largest one I own right now here to which I'm going to add my olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter and I'm going to preheat some over medium-high heat and a 1 everything is really really hot I'm going to add my turkey mince now breaking it apart with a wooden spatula and we'll cook for two minutes [Music] two minutes have Fathoms innocent how it looks like nowhere near being fully cooked but now the time has come to add all of the veggies in so that's the pepper celery onion garlic I'm going to season everything with a little bit of salt and pepper and cook for 7 minutes 7 minutes of fast and now lastly I want to add my poultry seasoning and click it chill for 30 seconds or so to waken it up and now the next thing time I have a large bowl I haven't learned food everything large because I have clearly a lot of stuff I put no felt that it will be less but this is really a lot so choose this largest ball just because so that just because so that Oh about the show we say leucemia Lithuanian from Jenna thing is ball so that it would be easier for me to mix I'm going to add my bread top it with these I don't know how else to call it in the yummy-looking mixture I'm going to be adding a little bit chicken stock at a time and then just mixing with my large spoon until everything is nicely mixed through [Music] and now let's elbow into this and then they think this should be a way bigger this is my small baking dish or cake pan pic of it and I'm going to use this one just because I don't have currently any of my other vacant pants you do want the bigger one just think if you have a bigger one you will have more surface which will get crunchy and crispy so that was now looking at this look I'm not really sure will it fit I'm hoping through the beds with let's see so there's going into here [Music] okay if you like a little bit pushing is what that will do now I'm gonna top it where the remaining one tablespoon of butter and actually that's why I cut it into these little little cubes because I'll just drop them all around the top of this Oh mixture and then put it into the oven for 25 minutes and I totally forgot to mention that I turned it on to preheat to 200 degrees at the same moment I started cooking well well now I'm mentioning so once that's gone I'm going to put it into 200 degrees Celsius Spritle oven for 25 minutes [Music] oh my goodness I'm so curious because well first of all it looks like a mess I own life but I know what was inside and I'm so kid with Brett well chase assemble now see bite and I feel like I'm making a mess oh no you're through okay to leave mmm-hmm just nice bread is still very weird I remember it's all good but Oh another thing either you're not or the cloud of celery I think maybe skip the celery in this recipe just because we're not cooking that long so it's really keep this picture and strong flavor I already got you to using celery in soups and stews because while you're cooking really long it kind of melts into the whatever dish you're cooking and like just gives a lot of flavor but you don't taste it that much but here like I did I know I don't like it that much and it's really crunchy and it has celery taste which but the thing is it quacks like a duck it walks like a duck it's a duck so it's a celery all right the bread is really soggy I think it's totally due to the small baking dish I use because in it was big then the liquid that was like there's still a little bit liquid it would have been a thinner layer of the liquid and it wouldn't evaporated if you like court now and totally what I was checking on it didn't burn I don't know saw that the liquid was bubbling away to the top off the baking dish which claimed the bread I mean there's nothing wrong with a bread super flavorful the little bit soggy bread how do you eat it I mean if there was no bread I imagine I could make some mashed potatoes or some rice or something like that or some noodles or whatever another is bread what am i serving with Oh celery I can double with you how I will be like removing it one by one don't get me wrong I got you salary but not that much this I'm still very curious about this dish what kind of often Jessica it's really new you and just because she like because baking dish and maybe because of the fryer you give you needed to make a folder you get older um kind of got into this whole one there are some parts of bread left but basically kind of like disintegrated that you like and then I have no idea how to eat them I think I will make a salad today but tomorrow I don't know by the way I totally remember that I didn't mention it in this particular turkey sausage we mix mix mix I actually use chicken just because I couldn't find any part of Turkey anywhere so there you have a little secret in the areas so if you know the dish could you let me know how it should be I do at the top got a little bit more crunch here but the rest of it will definitely like soft feel like this would be a very good meal to someone who has big teeth problem can super soft and you think we don't need to choose because for the nickname is based upon the mrs. perfect like grandma grandpa having issues with tip for cookies food a human anyways I could chat on and on just because it's really new I'm like bombarded by lots of different kinds of thoughts and ideas about this but for now I'll leave it happen yet so if you are going to take the original recipe we learn it there you can find as I mentioned the written recipe in the description box down below even if you don't try this recipe and oh maybe mark somewhere or something this is a great mix for these sausages I promise you that I made it I don't know how many times and I keep making it because it's really really nice and what else oh ultra seasoning awesome anyway I shared everything when I can share with you thank you so much for watching I really hope that it was fun and helpful please let know it is what I was supposed to get or should it should have is all these they're crunchy do you like such things do you eat such things where you live because I know there are lots of people out there watching me who are not from Canada or um yeah I'm there so that's the word you purchase some real victory is are you familiar with such kind of vision if not would you dare to try like veggies and meat with bread still sounds kind of change in such warm because I were watching your now see you soon goodbye [Music] you", "j4lYOolCKNc": "dealing okay so today I'm going to show you how to make epicures 15 minutes cauliflower soup so I have a multi pot here which I am simmered five cups of prepared vegetable boo Yong of course epicures vegetable boo Yong is this jar this jar gives you about thirty two cups of prepared boo Yong and hence has only 40 milligrams of sodium per cup so for those that are looking for a low-sodium

three ingredients is that I'll be using for the soup so epicures vegetable do epic here seasoning for roasted garlic aioli awesome alternative for garlic powder garlic salt but has a wonderful recipe

cup of water and I'm going to be adding two tablespoons of olive oil into that mixture and I will let it sit while I prepare my soup so 2 tablespoons of olive oil is mixed to this wonderful sauce this

wonderful pot for those that are campers by any means I did put five cups of epicures abu jaan and i added a head a medium head of cauliflower here and you would be able to use it as a blender since i
