{"G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope everyone is having a good ass day today I plan to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]",

eve um this was my first time ever trying an edible and it was the first time my parents ever caught me off the edible so i had 150 milligram um corova brownie pretty much the same size as this but it was 150 instead of a thousand and i [ __ ] blacked out for like at least three hours i woke up and it was like two o'clock new year's day um my homie was like oh your parents are calling you gotta go home and i was just across the street i go home and all my all the neighbors are outside they all see that i'm bonked and i like i'm almost falling over as i'm walking home so it was terrible um and my parents grounded me and that was the first time they figured out oh my god my kid's a stoner but now now they're out shopping and they're gonna come back and they're gonna just enjoy this oh his brain tastes gross this much two more bites you guys i'm not gonna lie the taste of this alone is so disgusting i [ __ ] hate brownie edibles so much the final bite that bite right there goes out to

another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "SWOwtIkGLRU": "[Music] welcome to my complete guide on how to make edibles at home I have made edibles like tons and tons of times and I usually never D carve I weed before making the can of butter and I like making very strong potent edibles and they always come out really well so if you're trying to save some time you can totally skip that step if you want to other than that you do not have to use butter you can use any type of oil you want and before I start the tutorial I'm going to do a step by step guide with all of the math right now on how to specifically dose your edibles that guide that I'm gonna go through is going to help you in deciding what ratios and quantities to use so what you're gonna need for this whole process is going to be your weed you're gonna need one to two sticks of butter you're gonna need some water a nonstick preferably nonstick saucepan a metal meat thermometer or you could use like a laser thermometer you're also gonna need some cheesecloth it's usually in the aisle buy like all of the cooking utensils like the spatulas and stuff like that it's usually in that area and then besides that you'll just need some type of cooking sheet or baking dish or jar to solidify the butter and oh and you'll need like a grinder or something to grind up the wheat obviously but with that being said let's make some edibles so the first step when we dose our edibles is we want to find the THC percentage of our weed now I made this little chart right here for you guys in case you know maybe you didn't get your weed from the dispensary if you catch my drift if you do get your weed from the dispensary the label is going to tell you the percentage but in case you don't know so we that you just get off the street that's like hey it's pretty good it gets me high but you know it's not like super frosty top shelf [ __ ] that is gonna be typically five to ten percent THC potency higher end weed something a little bit nicer that's gonna be like eleven to fifteen percent so I would say like the ten to fifteen percentage range is probably pretty average and then if you get your weed at the dispensary it's usually gonna be fifteen percent up to even thirty percent now the national average percentage THC percentage is ten percent now that we have figured out the percentage of THC in our weed we have to do some math this is optional this part right here which I'm going to explain to you guys there is actually a THC a to THC conversion so like I was saying earlier let's say your weed has 10% THC a we're gonna multiply that by 10 to get the milligrams per grams ratio so if your weed is 10% we multiply that by 10 that is 100 milligrams of THC per gram 100 milligrams of THC M equals eighty seven point seven milligrams of THC per gram that is all very confusing and you know eighty nine point seven is close enough to 100 so for simplicity reasons I just use 101 THC to THC ratio so 100 to 100 that way you don't have to you worry about this whole conversion here we're just gonna use a one-to-one ratio in which case you can ignore this conversion so now that you have your percentage of your weed for simplicity let's just say that your weed is 10% THC or 100 milligrams of THC per gram as I was explaining before that's the national average so I made this little chart for you guys that you can also screenshot so in this chart we have this side here is going to be our available amount of weed the total milligrams per batch this is how many milligrams of THC are in each brownie or cookie each individual serving if you have 1/8 of weed which is three and a half grams that's gonna be 350 milligrams per batch if we divide that by 12 that is 29 milligrams per brownie or per cookie so obviously like I said before for a batch of 24 servings you're going to divide the total milligrams per serving by - since we're doubling it honestly if you're gonna be using a full 1/2 ounce or a full ounce of weed I would say go ahead and make a batch of 24 I mean that's entirely up to you but if you put half to a full ounce of weed into half a cup of butter it's going to taste very like earthy and weeding again this is up to you use this table for reference and you can tweak the numbers as needed so yeah guys that is how you dose edibles if you have questions just leave them in a comment and I will be happy to answer those for you and then I'm putting these full pages out here so you can screenshot them and here I have the entire step-by-step guide to actually making the butter but if you want to go ahead and screenshot this for simplicity purposes please go ahead so first grab a cookie sheet line it with some parchment paper for this batch I am not using flour like nugs I'm using our shape jar so every time we've been rolling joints or blunts and there's leftover shape we put it in this jar along with the stems so I'm going to actually wait and see how much we've accumulated and I'm gonna use that and I know it looks like super stemming and everything home but there's like a shit-ton of Keith at the bottom if you could see that in the previous clip so I'm just gonna go ahead and weigh all of the shake and stems and see what we've got over time and as far as my dosing goes I'm just gonna say that the shake is about 10% put that in the oven to the carb at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes and every like 10 minutes or so you're gonna want to take that out to kind of stir it so the surface area is even so coarsely grinding the D carved weed is going to help the butter taste cleaner but you can use a coffee grinder I just don't really recommend it and then I'm turning my stove on low and we're putting in a full cup or two sticks of butter in there along with one cup of water so you want equal butter to water ratio and what the water does is helps it to regulate its temperature regulating the temp is key with making cannabutter so once the butter is kind of melted in the water as you can see you can go ahead and add in your ground-up flour and just mix it in there and then once the mixture has started to kind of simmer like this we're gonna go ahead and take our thermometer and take the temperature so the key here is we want the time sure to always be within 160 and 200 we do not want it to be over 200 so after I let this cook for 3 hours you can do 2 to 4 hours that's what it's gonna look like go ahead and grab a dish and some cheesecloth so I'm just taking the cheesecloth and we're going to you'll have to cut it because it comes in huge pieces to fit over a bowl that's what I'm using you can also use a jar or something like that and we're gonna go ahead and pour all of that mixture into the cheesecloth [Music] so once you have that all in there you're just gonna go ahead and wring out all the butter don't squeeze too hard because the cheesecloth can rip and then you'll have to start over that's happened to me before but yeah once you wring it out all the way you'll see what it looks like when it's dry [Music] yup Phelps like literal [ __ ] so we're gonna now transfer the butter to some type of cooking dish if you don't have a glass dish like this you can use a cookie sheet I've done that before and then we're going to saran wrap this and put it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours to solidify and then once we take it out of the fridge it's going to look like this and go ahead and take off the saran wrap and we're going to scratch the surface to see if any water has separated under the butter so if you added a lot of water throughout to regulate the temperature you'll have to crack the surface and drain the water out from the butter but since mine was good I'm good about regulating the temperature all the water evaporated from my butter while I was cooking it so now we are good to go we're making brownies so melt that butter back down put in a cup of white sugar we're gonna do 4 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract [Music] so next I'm just sifting in the dry ingredients it really makes a difference it's 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and then a cup of all-purpose flour go ahead and sift that add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking powder not baking soda and then go ahead and mix that up [Music] I'm putting this back into the same pan because it already has all that butter residue on it so it's like pre-greased then we're going to stick this in the oven at 350 degrees if I remember correctly for 25 minutes but don't quote me on that and this is the finished product you guys all done and ready to be eaten and I did testis and they were fired but thanks for watching", "SO2E5AwtXsk": "so what's going on boys what did we just find out we found out that the live show may or may not be not happening yeah and yeah

before you mix in your grinded up cannabis with your butter if you're gonna go ahead and turn your oven on to 220 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit and it puts your cookie sheet with some parchment paper I'm leave it all in there for about 40 to 45 and record deep carving but it's a super easy process I have no problem doing it so now you're just gonna want to stir it get going mixed in there nice and then just let it sit for about 3 hours minimum you can let it go up to 810 hours I mean I mean you'll be fine with about 3 hours 4 hours if you're just you know making some butter for yourself now you're gonna want to give you cheese cloth in the metal strainer over a container and just squeeze it all out so you could once you filter all the butter out of the cheesecloth you could also filter and again to another cheesecloth [Music] okay so I'm sure you can able to cool it down you don't want to store it in the fridge the freezer like a tub where there's something glass door and also don't ever microwave your butter or oil and yeah", "QLWn2LfVjMY": "I mean I'm hi I'm Tommy Chong and good day Tampa Bay Josh Hamilton said he could smell it on the field you were part of that marijuana

like comment subscribe new videos every Tuesday and Thursday yeah this is not a five we'll do it [Music] lazy", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or

in the last clip chance to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we

senior stoner back at you for a comparison of opiates vicodin to edibles and during the comparison discussion what i'm going to do is give you a peek behind the curtain if you will on how senior stoner manages his pain with less of these more of these which means edibles versus opiates here we go first of all i have to say that what's happened is i've been able to take my opiate use down from fentanyl patches 75 milligrams to one vicodin a day three time four times a day and sometimes i don't have to do that and the reason i've been able to do that isn't because they've solved my spinal condition isn't because i've been able to be operated on they've all refused isn't because i've been able to have the spinal stimulator oh well your pain changed mr senior stoner it's not going to work now carry on well i didn't take it sitting down this was all happening during pandemic and you had to wonder how was he able to survive you survived with the love of mrs senior stoner and you survive with the love of your family and the love of sugar and you all but you survive by finding a formula to conquer the pain and make you in control of the pain as much as possible you can't do it with all these because with all these you'll stop going to the bathroom you'll yell at your family and friends you'll have other complications you know what i'm talking about those of you who use these okay so how do we take these and use less of these i'm gonna take four vicodin for vicodin and put them on the table here in front of you all why okay there's four of that baggie there that's a day for senior stoner instead of 75 milligram fentanyl patches by the way did i tell you it was in addition to 20 milligrams of the lord of the day which is morphine essentially now down to uh you to some people this is very strong but i'm down to four vicodin a day how how is that possible unless if i really try if i grip my teeth or if i'm using alternative methods and that's the key here what is the alternative method what i have found isn't something i cook anymore okay it's a way of looking at it a way of measuring it a way of using the edible a little bit here and a little bit there instead of bang like that okay no sledgehammer you don't want a sledgehammer that's the first thing you need to understand you want a graduated effect you want to be happy dude and lady you want to be happy we all do you want to be out of pain but how do you get out of pain we can't get out pain got to get happy how to get happy you got to find something that makes you sing find something that makes you go find something that makes you move okay a lot of times unfortunately unfortunately because doctors have a lot of things it's not going to be these four pills they operate in the background it's like an aspirin what i've done is i've found nirvana two things blackout brownie and animal crackers you're gonna go what is he talking about well it's a thousand milligram blackout brownie and a package of seven pieces of 50 milligrams each animal crackers they're by the cookie factory i'm sorry i can't tell you where to get them how to get them i'm sorry a fairy drops them off here i'm sorry you know in the air a stork whatever but what i want to talk about is how i use them okay put any of your edibles that you can get in your hands here's how i use them forget the brand 350 which is five seven piece units seven five seven fifty milligram units one one thousand milligram brownie well i've tried eating the whole thousand milligram brownie and i almost didn't wake up it was unbelievable i got the shakes the shivers you know what it was crazy so what you need to do very simply a company called corova used to include a grid on how to cut it because what you have to do with this brownie if you have to take it out and score it you're going to say what do i mean by score well this already comes 7 50 milligram pieces so you can take it as you need it i take one or two a day depending okay but my primary edible is the blackout brownie and how i do it is the following way for you guys simply you're gonna measure it take a tape measure and it's gonna measure roughly three inches square three inches by three inches so what am i gonna do i'm gonna make tic-tac-toe out of it essentially what you're gonna do is you're going to cut it into 10 equal pieces you're going to say why why because you want to take it with you let's say i'm going to put away my pills why because you might want to take it with you number one why because that way it's pre-measured okay and it's easy that way you put it back in there and you have the pieces well that's really the textbook way to do it i'm gonna tell you guys again under the hood i'm giving you a picture a look behind the curtain i don't do it that way okay i take it as i need it and sometimes i'm off that's not good which means sometimes i haven't had enough and sometimes i've had too much there's a sweet spot it's like with a tennis racket or with a golf club you know what i mean when i say sweet spot so what you're going to want to do is you're going to simply want to cut this into the piece that makes sense for you everybody's going to have a different size piece they want okay i usually start with about 1 10 1 9 of the unit and i go from there so for example i'm going to cut a piece about this big you'll see i go on the corner and i cut careful with the crumbs this is very powerful stuff so you can't even leave crumbs around for children or pets i'm serious about this don't take a chance don't leave it around if you have a cat so here's where it comes out you're going to joke and say senior stone you're going to be kidding me that's about 1 12 1 12 1 10 yes it is okay because you can always add more with an edible one of the bad things about edibles is you can't go back and give it away oh i had too much sorry you got to wait it out so i recommend you start slow do not i repeat do not eat a whole thousand milligram brownie and think i'm a strong person it'll be fine don't do it so here it is right here all right the rest i put back in now an hour from now i'm going to reevaluate i'm going to say gee do i need more now part of the day today remember what i say before it's about being happy i said part of the day unfortunately with this storm i've been very stressed out which doesn't help pain but i would like to go watch tv and relax with sugar and sing for mrs stoner when she comes home so this particular brownie the blackout browning is as it says it is it is extremely strong wow i'm already feeling it believe it or not this is a little different feeling i'm almost gonna say it's sativa versus indica strong indica with a hallucinogenic element but the animal crackers are a nice enhancement animal crackers candy coated covered with the little sprinkles are really tasty excuse me for eating and the effect is going to be like a wave now you've put these two together so what i've learned to do and what i hope you all will learn to do with your edibles is take your time know what you're doing but know what you're doing you know what i'm saying it'd be a shame to have all this knowledge that we all have about edibles and then cut it in half and take 500 milligrams and think all's going to be cool because i'm going to a party it won't be cool all right somehow it's the way this brownie is engineered it's too strong layer in something like this which is a little bit of a pick-me-up it'll have a hybrid effect is what i would call it and now you've woven in two of the best things i can think of to keep yourself happy the whole discussion could have been framed would you rather be happy than in pain well do you have the secret way to do it you're looking at the stack of how to do it and i have the stack here and it's important you're looking at the stack for the right reason it's not because i want to show you my inventory you've seen that before you can see my you've seen my inventory not because i want to show you all the packages because i want to show you that i have a lot of them more than this and then i can control myself and that's the key you need to have self-control success with edibles success without a self-control equals success with edibles okay you know a doctor gives you a prescription the vicodin take one a day senior stoner uh four a day one four times a day okay or up two they gave you the prescription it's not on here in these packages it has ingredients it does not tell you how to take it it says seven servings per container on here probably because they wanted the package to be the same my point is that's 135 milligrams that's a lot for a person who hasn't had inevitable before for example so your individual use your individual judgments maintain your individual tolerances measure it out just like i showed you use a grid make your own template if you have to and remember it's very simple you want to use more of these and less of these this is the real senior stoner have a great day everybody if you thought this video was good please subscribe cheers", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "7E71_IYhPGc": "hey guys welcome to hot box it's a little straight my boy will today we got a dope review for you guys oh yes

psychoactive ingredient in marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "C3-Xrlo8rc8": "[Music] hey everyone what's going on hope

for those of you who don't know today i'm going to show you guys how you can eat the oil in your carts or how you can use it in edibles i'm going to show you guys how to make butter infused butter with your carts it's very easy once you get the distillate out of the carts you can use it in many different ways such as just plain straight up eating it adding it to butter you can also use it in quite a few different recipes i do have a few on my channel that i think it would go very well with such as adding it to oreos or to dummies um i'll post the links of some suggested edible videos for you guys to make below and check those out you can use the oil in most of the carts at least the ones that are distilled which if you're getting them from dispensary that's what they should be if they're ordered online it's hard for us to really know um i tried one of or some of the oil from one of mine that i ordered online and i'll show you guys the clip here of me um trying it and it really worked just straight up eating it even just a little bit of it i'm also going to show you guys in this video how to add oil to butter so you guys can have infused butter that way and in this case you guys don't need to decarb or anything like that because the thc is already activated when i show you guys how to make the butter with the oils in the cart you could also do the same thing with purchase the salad so in any recipe where it calls for half a cup of infused butter a quarter cup of whatever amount of infused butter if you don't have that infused butter that was made the traditional method you could also just add distillate to butter which is what i'm going to show you guys how to do in this video so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass today i will be showing you how to use carts and edibles or how to um just straight up eat them slash what happens when so um i have a bunch of miscellaneous cards i have um some that i ordered online a long time ago um and then i have some that are from dispensaries um and i don't really want to vape the ones that i got online i just don't know if i really trust them anymore i even have like um a whole full one that i'm probably just gonna eat somehow um but yeah so what i wasn't sure about is they should all be distilled and they definitely will be um the ones i'm getting from the dispensary i definitely know are with one's online i'm not so sure um but it's like a 95 chance that the cards that you have are just phillip um but that's what this method i'm going to show you guys is for and if it's a different type i don't um i can't confirm that it would work the same one thing i wanted to try is if i would eat some of the liquid what would happen um and i did that a few days ago i recorded it and i'll put that in here and i'll show you guys exactly what happens okay so i have one of my cards here which is mostly empty and i'm going to um consume it i don't know how much i'll see how much i can get out um and we're going to see if this is going to do anything because i don't know if i need to heat them up first for them to work or if they're just gonna um work on their own so instead of trying to just figure it out because like i said i bought these online and i don't actually know how legit they are um so we're just gonna try it and we're gonna we're gonna see if that works i'm going to i couldn't unscrew this by hand so i'm just using um a rubber glove for a little bit of grip or this isn't rubber i don't know what this is called but and then um these for some more grip and that comes off pretty easy i think yeah so there's that [Music] i guess i should turn this right here [Music] um i'm just trying to see if i can pull this thing out okay i think what i should do is put this in some i'm gonna put this in a cup of hot water first so that the uh liquid will warm up and kind of i'm just gonna place it like um this direction so when i take it off the liquid will be down here okay so i have a i just have a shot glass that i put um i filled with hot water from the top and i'm gonna place this in here um like this so that um the water will heat it up and it'll drop to the bottom where i need to access it from so i'm just popping that in there and i just made sure that there was enough water to actually cover um all the way up to here so i had to fill it up pretty high and then i figured this was probably going to cool off pretty fast so i got another bowl of just some water that i put in the microwave for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna place this into the bowl to kind of like just keep the water warm and i'm just gonna check on it every so often and then um put warmer water in there although it's already dropping down so we might not even need to change that so yeah i'm just gonna leave this here for a few minutes okay so i had to warm up the water once through this whole thing it took about like 20 minutes for it to um melt so there it is there's still a little bit there but i'll just dig it out okay so i'm just gonna dry this off there we go and then coming undone there okay so i'm just gonna use this toothpick to to get it out i'm just gonna straight up like eat it [Music] it doesn't taste bad it doesn't really taste like anything i hope this works so yeah i'm just scraping it out with a toothpick it's a little bitter and then i'm going to take a lecithin pill and i usually just take these when i take edibles just because it helps a little bit so this is how much is left in here and i'm gonna get the rest of that out which i got almost like i consumed almost all of it but the little bits they're sticking to the side i'm gonna get out when i um get the rest of all of my cartridges like when i do the whole thing which is this what this video is for um but yeah so it is 3 13 so 3 o'clock and i will report back and see if this works or if it does absolutely nothing and i'm really hoping that it works because it's gonna be so much simpler to utilize these carts um if i don't have to deal with heating them up and making sure that all goes smoothly but yeah so i'll be back in a few hours so it's been it's five o'clock so i don't know two hours oh my it worked for sure um i think it's just you know when you take some edibles and you're like oh they're not working i should take some more and then you take more and then you're like oh my god i shouldn't have taken more that's how i feel right now my mouth is so dry so dry and some juice um sorry yeah it definitely worked and i don't know how much stronger and how much more it's gonna kick in like for how long for but i can't even think straight but um this is like really good because and i didn't smoke any weed today at all the only thing i consumed along those lines was that um little cart thing so because i wanted to be sure about it like i was tempted to still hit the pen but i was like i want to be sure that if i feel something i know it's from the pen but yeah okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna reflect back more on this when i'm in another in a better state in the video part next okay okay bye oh gosh i'm so chill very very guys this hits hard okay i feel like i could have taken less you know just be careful with how much you take i think it's a very good amount that i took i think hopefully it's snowing outside also which is insane [Music] october and freezing too so yeah as we see clearly it worked very well i actually was licking some earlier and i shouldn't have because i have to make sure what i'm doing is correct and even just a little bit of it like works very well and i find i have a pretty high tolerance for edible so i was surprised how little of it it took for it to have a strong effect i'm gonna try this one that was broken i'm just gonna like lick whatever is left off of there so i was just playing around with my cartridges to see how to open each one and i was going to open this one and when i was using the pliers to turn it it wasn't i'm turning up here so i decided to put um this onto the glass part in turn and even just a little bit of pressure and it completely shattered so just an fyi when you guys are trying to figure out how to open your carts don't put your pliers directly on the glass i know it's common sense but i still did it so just fyi i don't know if we'll be able to salvage any of this i'll see what i can do but i don't really wanna end up putting a lot of glass in my mouth okay so with the broken one it's not really there's so much glass on it so i don't really know how else to use it so i'm gonna try adding it to this pipe that already has like some stuff in there it's mostly burnt um i'm gonna try and melt this into here and i don't care if there's a little bit of glass in there um because that's fine i'll just throw it out after um so let's see if this works i'm just gonna use a blow dryer to melt this off of here okay so with just using um a little bit of the blow dryer already started to kind of melt off so i'm gonna just yeah see it's a little sticky just try and like push that off into there so there's the glass in there and it was honestly very difficult to get the rest of the oil out of the cart so i kind of think you just kind of have to go with whatever chunks of broken cart you have and just kind of throw them in there so when i light this i'm just going to light it pretty much just like on the like around the glass like on the other side of it just kind of heat it up and then yeah i'm just going to hit that this looks sketchy as heck oh i got quite a bit out of that okay so let's just take a look at it after it's been smoked yeah it all came off pretty well with just a couple hits so your first step is to figure out um where your wear slash how your cards open so for a lot of them i find um you can twist them off by hand at least the ones i ordered online i find if you have um some grip just this glove here yeah now i can't open it once the camera's on okay there we go so yes that comes out um so just figure out where your cards open i assume they should all be on the top but i can't guarantee you want to put the cart so that wherever they open which for me is the tops of them um is on the bottom so that when all the liquid melts down when we open it it'll be easy to access okay so i just had a bowl of um hot water here and then a shot glass michael jackson and i'm gonna fill up that um shot glass with that hot water and then put it in the bowl with hot water to keep it nice and warm now i'm gonna take my cards and place them um with the tip up so that the distillate will fall to the tip which is where i want it to go and i'm actually just going to pour out enough water so that the um water isn't going into the the uh the part that gets screwed in but just enough to keep most of the distillate warm so it can melt properly and then we're just going to wait for this and as it cools down i'll just reheat it or add um more hot water until all of the liquid in the carts fall down which i think will take about 10 minutes ish okay so the water that i used was not warm enough so you want to make sure this water is really hot almost boiling but not boiling um and then it should take about 10 minutes so there's a couple ways you can consume these and the first would be just straight up eating it so let's start with this cartridge here i'm just gonna dry that off and then i'm gonna twist it open [Music] okay so there is our oil i'm just gonna lick this right off here and because it's really warm it came off really easily super easy to get off and then for the rest of this i'm just gonna take a toothpick and do that and then i'm just going to eat it right off the toothpick and then repeat those steps until i have ate all of this little bit of oil in here it doesn't taste the best it's not gonna lie i find that um oops the um the ones from the dispensaries taste a little better than the ones that i ordered online okay so i got pretty much everything i can get out of this one you can either throw this away or you can refill it with some more distillate and another way to eat it is similar to just eating it but if you kind of want to avoid the taste and are looking for something easy i suggest using oreos now yes these are oreo minis but you could use whatever oreos you like this is just what i had at home so i'm gonna get another cartridge here let's pull up this one isn't that beautiful that's one nice thing about getting your carts from the dispensary they're just much nicer looking much nicer looking and this one here is my favorite it's called spinach and the top part that you uh the mouthpiece it actually moves around let's see if you guys can see that see so yeah most of them don't do that so i really like that okay now we're going to open this one and i need to dry that off again too this one is a lot harder to open and while i'm doing this i'm just tasting the one that i had in my mouth and honestly it leaves a pretty gross taste i don't really love that but if you eat something else that's thick it'll probably um disguise it oh my goodness i could not get this open this is going to be an issue i have a feeling because these are from dispensaries it might be what the heck am i tightening it the wrong way so i really cannot get this one open i don't know what it is so i'm just gonna set it back and i think i'm just gonna break into it um to get the rest of the distillate out but for these oreos i'm gonna use this one to show you guys so it seems like the ones from like i said the ones from the um when you order them online or off the block market or whatever these are very easy to unscrew um but the ones from dispensaries not as much kind of makes sense because they're probably trying to avoid you from using them over again so yeah i'm just again gonna um look whatever's left off here tastes horrible i mean it's not that bad i'm being so dramatic okay and then i'm going to um use the toothpick i just have a fresh toothpick here to get the rest of this out okay so i'll just take that um right out of there and i'm gonna put it right into the middle of my little oreo and close that and then that is good to eat and i'll do the same with the other oreo here and you can put as much or as little as you want oh look at that one right here this one is made to put a whole bunch in there and guys i'm not serving these to people so don't don't be saying how nasty this this looks or is because i'm just eating it myself and then the cooler this gets the harder it's going to be get um to get out so work fast um or just put the screw the lid back on and put it back in some hot water but yeah we got most of that out okay so there's one way to do that and then the other is if you want to um use your carts in anything um that would usually require a infused butter or oil you can do that with this so here i have some melted butter this is just regular butter and then i melted it um and then i'm going to directly add my carts right into here and mix all together i'm also going to add some lecithin in here which is going to help bind the butter to the distillate as well as help our bodies absorb the thc i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own and the specific amount doesn't really matter i probably put more than i needed in there but oh well so we're going to add in our carts and all we're going to do is just scrape them into here and mix it really well and then you can use this butter in any recipe that calls for infused butter so the ratios doesn't really matter if you want to put 10 carts in here go put 10 cards if you want to do one cart just do one cart and then say you wanted to make brownies and your brownies call for half a cup of infused butter you can use half a cup of your infused butter so this is really it essentially is the same thing as if you were to add the cart directly to a um say like a batch of brownies but the thing is it would be very hard to distribute that little bit of distillate throughout the whole brownie so by putting it into the butter we're able to get the butter to go throughout all of the brownies instead of just working with you know this much liquid we're working with this much or more so now let's add these ones and so because there's such little left in these in order for me to show you guys how i would actually do this slash how you guys should do this i'm gonna um use this full cart that i haven't used yet and like i said i don't want to use the one i don't want to um inhale the ones that i had ordered online back before so this is a good way to use it so i just heated up a cup of water in the microwave it's almost boiling but not and this came in a package i'm just going to put it right in there and let it actually i'm going to turn it around so that we have the bottom going in first so we can melt this liquid a little bit more so it'll be easier to pour into our butter so i'm going to leave that in there um for a few minutes i just got a comment and say be careful because i've been licking these and like the toothpick and stuff and it gets hitting me hard and i don't know i know i should stop but for the video you know i just want to taste like icings i think i got some oreo icing in it but be careful with how much you use okay this has been been in here for about like five minutes so it should be oh my god it's so hot okay so it should be good if you don't have it doesn't come in one of these bags which i know most don't just put it in a little plastic baggie to be honest it's probably fine to go in without anything but i mean why not use a bag isn't this packaging super cute i love these ones but i don't know i feel weird about using the ones online so i'm just going to open that because i gotta dry it off again there's our brand new cart and i'm gonna open um this part right here and then we're gonna pour all this liquid into our butter that's been melted so this should come out pretty easily because um it was in the hot water melting yeah you can see we got most of that out already okay and then whatever is left which there isn't much um i guess we'll just use a toothpick to get that out but you could use a blow dryer too to kind of push it down but yeah that came out really easy and it was only in the hot water for um like three or four minutes and you know i really don't like the taste of the back of all this like in the back of my throat like as i'm doing this because i've been eating like eating a little bits throughout and it just does not taste good so i really think it'd be nicer with the oreos and stuff so that you can kind of have something i don't know so it doesn't have to like line your mouth and throat it can just go right into your stomach and see now i have um it's all over this and i can't get that into the butter so i'm just gonna have to like suck this off of the toothpick how delicious okay this one doesn't taste as bad kind of tastes like lip gloss cool so now that we have um that poured in we're just gonna mix it into this butter and it's fruit punch flavored flavored i guess scented no i don't know i'm not sure but it doesn't really taste like fruit punch it does when you inhale it but the actual oil doesn't so that mixed in very very well and at this point you can just put it in the fridge and it's good to use in your recipes a nice easy infused butter i think i'm going to um scrape out the rest of my three cartridges and put them in here but because there's such little left in here it might be best to just um scrape it out with a toothpick and just kind of like eat it directly off not right now because honestly i've had too much and i can already tell it's like i'm going down a bad road with how much i've had and it hasn't even been that much but i still have to make dinner and stuff so i got to be capable of doing all that and i don't know about you guys but the one thing that i need to realize i shouldn't do when i'm high is cook because every time i cook when i'm high i mess something up and i'm not type person who usually messes things up when i cook but oh my goodness the nastiest the most gross dish i've ever made or the only like really bad dish the grossest dish i ever made was when i was high it was just i was making oh i don't want to tell you guys it was so gross but yeah so for these cards that i can't open i think i'm just going to straight up break them and do that to get the oil out um so yeah let's try that please tell me if there's a better way to open these because i feel like there must be something or i am just a major weakling and i can't open them i'm just gonna get this out of the way i'm gonna oh god how should i do this i think i'm just gonna like smack it with this oh god i'm so scared yeah okay what the heck there we go okay so i broke that there's the oil and then like i said we could put this without the sticker in um a pipe and use that because it'd be too hard to scrape this off i don't know how many times i'm going to tell you but it really does not taste good in in the mouth i need to go eat something like chewy to get get rid of the taste okay so these pieces i feel like need to go into the pipe so i'll put those there so we got all that there and then i'm gonna get my pipe this honestly feels like the most sketchy ghetto thing ever like literally smoking pieces of glass just be careful if you guys are gonna do this i'm assuming everybody is a grown up with a fully developed brain don't hurt yourself okay and then i'm literally going to smoke this these pieces of glass like a huge sketchy person but it works it really does work surprisingly now we got my glass that i'm about to hit okay let's do this yeah something's sparked so it's just like should i continue doing this you know what i don't suggest smoking the glass okay i did it if you choose to do it it wasn't me who's recommending it so just keep that in mind because that was a little bit sketchy and like what if you lit it up and then uh like glass sparked into your eye you know what i mean okay i'm so scared something's gonna hit my eyes let me just i'm still gonna do it even though i don't suggest it but just give me one second i'm back and i'm protected and i'm ready to try this again actually one second okay now that i got my personal protective equipment i think i'm ready to try this again i'm gonna get rid of that one with a little bit of something else on there i think it was like a sticker or something and let me just yeah there's still a little more there okay very fruit punch not really under the sea under the sea darling gets better down where it's wetter take it from me so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass but yeah i took the glass out not a good idea don't do it i mean you can but i do not suggest i'm good [Music] too um um yes thank you guys again very much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and i apologize if it's all over the place because i'm a little high right now but when i wanted to show you guys in the last like 20 minutes i had let this butter sit out when i was [Music] smoking i don't know what i was doing and this is what it looks like just so you guys can kind of see it has stayed um emulsified uh you guys can't see that too well can you there you go so yeah that's how the butter looks a little a little weird-ish texture but yeah that is just regular unsalted butter one cart and some lecithin mixed it and i'm just gonna go store this in the fridge and then i'm gonna use it maybe to make um some toast tonight perhaps okay guys so to summarize a few different ways we put our distillate directly into our oreos just open them up rub some onto the frosting we melted some butter and poured in some warmed up distillate mixed it together with a little bit of lecithin i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own but if you find that you're mixing it together and it's not mixing just put it in the fridge go buy some lecithin and you can always add it later it's not going to hurt anything to add it um a little bit later instead of at the same time thank you guys so much for watching this video i apologize if i am being a little bit confused in any of the video because i've been needing the oil the whole time and it's just like it's hit me and i also was smoking my glass so that hit me real hard um as well speaking of which i do have the rest of mine that i'm going to hit right now but thank you guys very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give it a thumbs up and subscribe you", "AZynhX-qcc4": "it's been a nice two hours of high getting a little bit progressively stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm glad to be back on youtube i've missed you guys many more videos to come just you wait but my name is jeff peace", "kTWnxUdXWik": "[Music] wha-wha-wha-what will welcome two weeks y'all we got our fancy wheats plates you know what that means it's time for my favorite name of any edible goodies find the Gooch best name for taste and potency I can tell you from our last movie to review neither of those things is actually true best known for ok taste and lackluster potency should be their their name or or mabushii silly name so so animal that is what we were looking at today is the Minaj fudge brownie welcome to week skies weeks is the show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today is a week's mini where instead of our customary comebacks at 30 60 and 120 where I just come to you guys today and back you at 2 hours and let you know how we're feeling for these lower ghost edibles so this much as you can see is a hundred and eighty milligrams I believe the last one was a hundred and seventy that we tried and it wasn't the most powerful hundred and seventy milligram edible I never purchased now I believe I got this for seven dollars in a dispensary in Orange County so rather affordable but you know okay here we go hashtag stay Micucci I use that hashtag don't think anybody else has ever used it alright here's a brownie and a nice very standard issue looking brownie nothing rages here smells like a brownie no wheat smell really and that I can discern there's a good brown yeah on the fudgey or end of brownies let's kick you more fudgy mmm slightly taste but just a hint I mean just a hint nothing that's gonna make you gag nothing it's gonna make you not like you did but just be aware there is an ever so slight we taste to it but on the whole I have certainly had worse brownies got brownies okay nope excuse me I don't know why it's easy I like to talk with my mouth bullets sometimes in another times I'm bashful about it who the [ __ ] knows anyways I'm gonna finish my booms here I'm gonna statement Gucci finish this off and I will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling see you then bye guys it's been about two hours since I consumed this Maggie or Magoo CH or however you say it and it's 2 for 2 in terms of megachurches to maggots to meg Gooch's skipping the brownie tasted okay but it's been about two hours I certainly feel a little high but for a hundred and eighty milligram edible you would expect or hope to feel quite a bit more than this if your tolerance is really really low and it's really cheap at the dispensary and this your only option maybe go for it again it's not the worst edible I've had in terms of potency or taste I've experienced worse on either end but it's just there's just nothing special about it again if you see the goodies by the brooch and your dispensary nearest you hard pass I won't say soft pass soft pass with that thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you out on the next review", "X1U2wEtzooE": "hello everyone we are back with another episode of weeks today we are going to be looking at the MILF and cookies brand [ __ ] brownie 375 milligrams of THC so first and foremost we've got the name noth and cookies which is on I guess it's a play on milk and cookies but mom I'd like to [ __ ] and cookies makes very little sense to me anyways uh 375 milligrams as I said the [ __ ] brownie it's got some shitty packaging just a plastic wrapper oh this isn't edible that does not require refrigeration unlike different companies but let's open it up and take a look and try fight alright so here we go here is the [ __ ] brownie not much of a weed smell very very very very small hint of cannabis uh it looks like a brownie cookie hybrid with some Oreo like bits in there and some chocolate chips again this is our [ __ ] 375 milligrams brownie from cookies I bought this from eleven dollars from a dispensary in Orange County this I think again is on the low end of how much you could find this for I'm guessing this probably normal it's runs about fifteen bucks and most dispensaries so yeah without further ado let's give it a buy here see how it tastes well it's not bad um very little wheat flavor on the Sun but not anywhere near the best brownie I've ever had in my life it's a little dry the Oreo bits taste suspiciously like hydrops they still make eyebrows I don't know but it's not bad it's not bad you're not gonna gag eating this one for sure um but the most important thing as always is how this makes us feel and as always guys I'm gonna finish this here and I will check back within you with you guys in 30 minutes one hour and two hours and let you know how we're feeling so I'll check back with you guys then thanks for watching weeds hi guys welcome back we are I'm checking in with you here at the half hour mark for the experiment with our milk and cookies [ __ ] bratty I went ahead and uh dusting off that bad boy again not the best tasting brownie in the world if you hate the taste of marijuana it'll be fine for you because it doesn't really have much of a weed taste but but yeah it's it's not a good brand as a brownie uh ingredients nothing too strange in here lots of you know we got some partially hydrogenated soybean or condensed cottonseed oil not a big deal okay so half an hour and most important question how am I feeling this is this was a 375 milligram and which is pretty potent edible half an hour and I'm feeling a little bit as expected won't be feeling 100% strength just yet but there's a nice little mind hike coming on nothing quite in the body yet but a placid peaceful hiya so far I'm looking forward to seeing how this will feel in another half hour when I'll check back with you guys the hour mark so let you know how this brownie is feel and then thanks so much hi guys I'm back it's been an hour since I had that milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie thinkin warm not sure why it's called a [ __ ] brownie I don't know if that's really a name for a brownie cookie hybrid thing um you might be wondering why I've got this rice krispies treat with me that's because I want to eat it and you might be wondering why I would want to eat a giant rice krispies treat after eating that entire giant brownie that's a great question and the reason is because I ate that entire brownie and it makes me want to eat rice krispies treats now not a very good feels pretty good this has been one hour mark catch you guys in another hour this time I won't have one of these ciao ciao now that's what I call milligrams 375 mm in fact milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie it doesn't taste very good but it'll do the trick I give it four SOI lectins out of five canola and or palm oils that's next time PostScript I think at the one hour mark while also I think I forgot that the last mark was two hours I forgot to mention that the last time I talked to you I was two hours the time before that the one hour mark I promised you I wouldn't habit of miss left but I do and I just want to apologize for that catch you next time on weeds just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends

episode of wheats thanks for watching we'll catch you guys next time", "0V7Z3GQX1xg": "[Music] hello friends welcome to week 2 marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking lol edibles free Lupe's what a fun name to say fruity Lupe's fruity Lupe's fruity Lupe's just like Froot Loops but with weed if you saw my last video with my lol edible its reviews you saw that I reviewed their chronic toast crunch and found it to be a real pleasant surprise these advertise they have 400 milligrams of THC which I still don't believe to be true or its I know I don't believe it to be true but I do believe them to be a good value these cost 10 dollars I think I got it for 8 with a discount at my dispensary and it's a nice small little discreet package unlike the other cereals what you have to eat a whole bunch of this is just a quick little thing you can snack on yourself and it's pretty potent again I don't think it's 400 milligrams or the chronic toast crunch I don't think was but it's still potent enough to get me pretty high so this is the fruity Lupe's variety as you can see which again is just Froot Loops lol pack lol animals packaging leaves a lot to be desired ingredients on the back pretty basic doesn't have any sort of nutrition information but I guess you can just go look up for loops and see what the nutrition information is there but yeah I hope I hope that this is just as good of a pleasant surprise as the chronic tears crunch because this is a good value if this gets me just as high I gotta say this great value but let's go ahead and open her up give it a taste I've got a sneaking suspicion I've got it I know how this is gonna taste but we'll go ahead and do it anyways tastes like fruit loops with weed except more stale than I was hoping for it pretty stale actually hello I'm Justin I'm just gonna munch on it no big deal even if it is a little stale I'm a little Wiggy tasting it's not terrible you're not gonna hate the taste of this you can get down just imagine stale Froot Loops with a slight weed aftertaste and you know exactly what fruity loopies are going to taste like but as we all know the most important part about any edible review it's not necessarily the way it tastes but how it makes you feel and for that I'm have to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this fruity Louise fruity loopies are landing so thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll see you in about two hours peace folks it's been two hours since I had the lol edibles fruity loops and I'm pleased as punch to say that they are just as good as the chronic toast crunch that was the name of the other the chronic toast crunch again do not believe them to me 400 milligrams but I still believe them to be a pretty good value at 10 bucks this is this is gonna get you pretty stoned if your tolerance is anything like mine even with a high tolerance I'm still filling it it doesn't taste wonderful doesn't taste terrible as we said before tastes like stale Froot Loops with a weedy aftertaste but I'm high on these no pun intended I have changed my opinion about lol edibles slightly which I said in the last review from them as well I'll be more open to trying products from them and hoping for the best [Applause] and also changes my opinion a little bit on the breakfast cereals the 2ia are the different brands I had done before the side found wanting and these I Fiat found both I like that they're both more compact you there's less to have to eat and I found that I was higher and at the same price so the LOL LOL edibles are the way to go when it comes to the cereals and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching we

cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "JfIpLufN8O8": "what's poppin faves okay so um tonight i'm going to try an edible i literally posted the other day that i was gonna take an edible and show you guys the effects of the edible whoopty i ended up taking that edible and it did not like it did nothing i was literally up till like five o'clock in the morning like and nothing happened what's poppin face oh i took away what but um so i'm live from my room today i actually love this ring light and i 10 out of 10 cannot wait to film other videos with it but today we are going to be trying an edible um i opened it already and i took out like a eighth of it so it says the recommending so the recommendation is that you eat an eighth of it which is 50 milligrams that's like the thoughtful portion that's what it says like right here i can barely show you guys but um yeah i'm just gonna eat the whole thing the rest of it i took off like an eighth um this is 400 milligrams so the rest of it should still be like 350 milligrams i haven't ate that much or 300 at least um yeah and i'm just gonna record my reaction for you guys record how it makes you record how i feel um personally i'm taking edibles before so i've done it before so that's the only reason i'm eating the whole thing if you've never tried it before i recommend trying the thoughtful portion and then maybe working your way up to more so make sure to subscribe to my channel if you're new what's poppin if you're not thanks for watching let's get it that's what we do when we oh my quarantine i'm struggling because this is what it looks like actually it's smaller than i thought that's what it looks like a bunch of nerds just fell off of it oh my gosh nerds are difficult so i don't know i don't know if it's in the nerds or this rope thing or whatever but i'm gonna just eat the nerds that are in here and i'm gonna eat the rope oh my god so i'm not encouraging anybody to take edibles or to do anything everybody's who each their own i'm just doing it for me i think i like it whatever i think it's fun um and i just want to show you guys like the effects just in case you were interested or anything you could see firsthand on somebody else but if you were to take anything make sure you are home in a safe place and not driving on the road or nothing putting you or anybody else in danger what's up guys so i'm kind of hella disappointed it's 1 21 it's literally been like two hours right and it still hasn't hit so i'm like 10 out of 10 want a refund so i went out and i bought some new edibles from i'll drop their instagram in my description actually um and yeah they're supposed to be good so let's see i bought different types i bought well literally i got this rice krispies which is like it's supposed to be like a cereal bar that's like 65 milligrams um i got this cookie it's actually broken but this is supposed to be 150 milligrams i believe and then i got what i'm trying tonight which is a brownie a s'mores brownie and that's supposed to be 300 milligrams so the milligrams is basically just like how much is in it of course like the ones that are higher are more potent and the ones that are lower are less um so that means just like it's supposed to have more effects but you know you could never be too sure so let me show you guys the ones i'm going to be taking so this is it it's a s'mores i had to adjust that a little it's a s'mores brownie and i don't know the bottom there's the people it's called a hotbox baked pinco um it smells good like it smells like how edible supposed to smell i've took edibles before so i kind of know a little but yeah smells good it smells like it's gonna be crazy i'm i'm like low-key lit like i'm low-key excited but i'm looking scared uh because i don't want to be knocked out ages is back here being a criminal she's gonna literally but um now i have it i'm like can this camera get right so i'm eating the fork because i'm being bougie today so get on live you're gonna eat online ain't nobody gonna see it why

anxiety because i'm like when is it gonna happen but right now we're just watching youtube videos i don't know if i did a good job at showing that but me and my peanut okay guys actually guys it's 3 27 so it's been over an hour and i literally feel completely okay so this is about to be another fail but maybe not but we're painting to see if maybe that'll get us into like our artsy type of thing

guys but i'm trying to see the painting so update okay guys time check it's 404 um we're painting still asia just finished her painting but we decided that we're just gonna take the other two ones because the ones we took didn't hit and um yeah so let's see this they literally smell so strong i'm trying to whisper because my parents are sleeping oh wow it smells so strong but then like this is less milligrams than the other ones so i'm like hmm so i'm eating half rice crispy and a half of the cookie we like to put in halfway my eyes are like low but i'm like tired in general so i don't know it won't focus i look hawaiian okay so i think something happened i keep hearing noises like i keep hearing like i keep hearing like footsteps and like i keep feeling like stuff is on me once i start whispering you know but at the same time i don't know i think you made me tired but i think i'm just going to go to sleep anyway so i'm kind of tired it was a good nature song i got so high that i saw jesus look at the ring light how are you feeling i feel good do you how i'm tired you're trying to make me feel really clean not like oh my god it's gonna fall out but i could go to sleep it's five o'clock we did it you've had better edibles though right yeah yeah all nighter", "tCfqRz4dbCI": "[Music] we8 es sweets wheat sweet sweets welcome to weed skies the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today and any time it's a classic ass that means it's inedible why don't we call these classic ass episodes edibles classic ass if you're a newer member to wheats uh our for our first year or so here on wheats we only reviewed edibles everything else has come since then so we call all edibles classic ass previous we just clone classic but I decided to start calling classic ass for some reason so we are reviewing an edible today and what edible is that a very classic brownie good old-fashioned weed brownie and this is from Wow brownies THC infuse excuse me Wow edibles 300 milligrams of a THC oh this is a THC infused brownie it cost me 15 bucks at my dispensary it is very shitty packaging this is a 300 milligram edible uh which is an illegal edible and I got it from my black market dispensary in Long Beach that's why it was so cheap there's a conspiracy theory part of my brain that tells me Wow edibles is just a rebranded version of what I'll call the wheats nemesis I don't know if that's true but I intend to do some digging I've got a sneaking suspicion that there are a few companies operating under an umbrella to sell edibles and devices under a bunch of different names and when one of those names one of one of those reputation starts go down the toilet they just amp up production on another I haven't figured that out if that's a hundred percent true but look for that video in the future Wow edibles so we'll take this as a as if this I didn't have any of those suspicions now if you know I do have some reservations the price the packaging all those things are red flags to say this brownie may not be as potent as advertised uh I don't like how heavy it is not to eat a big heavy brownie and if it really has three nur milligrams of THC it's probably not it's gonna taste like [ __ ] and I don't have to eat a [ __ ] ton of shitty brownie so let's go ahead and open it up uh get a smell a taste all that good stuff and while I'm pulling out I'll explain the REITs reviews process pretty simple gross dude ooh it seems nasi um the way our reviews work is I will eat this whole goddamn but I really don't want to it weighs like four ounces I guess it's not insubstantial oh I'll wait this whole thing over the next hour so and then after I finish it two hours after I finish it I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you care about in the edible review you know isn't really gonna get you high you know we want to know if it tastes good but you really want to know if it's gonna get you [ __ ] up Oh so the it's covered in like sticky oil or [ __ ] everywhere it's disgusting it's I mean look at that it's just sticky and nasty it has not really any cannabis odor to speak of it it looks like a very fudgy brownie let's give it a taste YUM well it's bad but it's not bad because that as a canvas tastes as a little bit maybe but not a lot um as a matter of fact a disarmingly little tiny cannabis taste what it does just have is a the taste of a shitty brownie like you know like you'd go over to a sleepover at your friend's place and his mom would make some brownies but his mom really sucks at making brownies and you just have to pretend that you like the brownie and you want to eat the whole thing that's what's gonna happen here this is a shitty mom brownie oh well all this [ __ ] I better get something out of this guys I'm really hoping um so my face off this shitty-ass Barney oh and then sorry to complain so much I'm sorry [ __ ] sandwich guys to to to to to all right I'm a business guy two hours after I finish it I will come back to you guys and let you know about this Wow edibles the THC and use browning fingers crossed guys so fingers crossed thank you so much for watching weeds guys and I'll see you back here in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back to week skies it has been two hours since I had the well animals th infused brownies it's just a brownie I don't know why it's plural curious anyways it's not bad um totally worth the 12 bucks I paid for it it tasted bad really I mean it didn't have a bad cannabis taste it just tastes like really shitty brownie like you know like I was just sitting there chewing like it's like sub Little Debbie quality brownie so bad um but I am pleasantly hi I mean look at my eyeballs pretty pink eye I am really surprised outrageous lehigh in it I don't think there's 300 milligrams of THC in there to be honest uh but it is worth the $12 I paid for it nope I have no problem saying that I even if these guys are the guys that I think that they might be and I have some investigative work to do there uh this is not a bad product again don't like the taste don't like how much you have to eat it's it's a lot I mean it's a [ __ ] ton of bad brownie but it is a good value there's no denying that and speaking of good values I want to share with you guys a little cherry on top

description is it is a rogue like deck builder if both of those terms mean nothing to you good for you it means that you are not into video games and that's probably good for your social life but if

stoner fans happy holiday this is another in our rolling series of super reviews of cool things we're staying on edibles and trying to get people to understand them use them effectively and get relief from them today we're gonna talk about kana candies wild cherry belts this includes 400 milligrams of THC in 8 and digitally infused 50 milligram belts it's thunderstorm calm is the company name let's take a look these candies are from kana candies and they were joyful journey pure experience remember the joy and playfulness found in life's journey to provide a pure experience kind of candies uses highest quality co2 extracted cannabis oil standard warnings and here's my experience with this get down sir there's my experience with this the belt actually tastes good that's the first thing that's important secondly they separate very easily for sure get down there separate easily from one another they also are efficient what I mean by that is you can separate them which is me and you don't waste much you get 50 milligram belt chew it and you have seven belts left so it really works effectively for people who like myself don't have strong fingers don't have strong hands it's a way to easily medicate yourself you don't have to do biting and cutting and tearing and ripping it just pulls right apart no the other thing to remember is that 50 milligram belt might be too much for somebody start with half a bell start with third of a belt get yourself comfortable I don't want anybody being unable to drive this holiday season or just falling euro into an uncomfortable state so kind of candies is info at Cana candies calm these really are cool they come packaged really safely and well you could repackage them as well and is this locked off from the packet to come did enjoy everybody and this is today's edible review by senior stoner", "LIxWizJSaRA": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] no [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what up with everybody hope you're doing great today we're going to be doing a little review on these nerd ropes i got two of them and i'm gonna eat them both so one of them says 420 milligrams and the other one just says 400 milligrams so usually with these they say 1 8 of a whole nerd rope is one dose which is only a little piece so we're going to eat it all and i'm going to give you my honest opinion on these and tell you if it's worth it or not if it really gets you faded so without further ado let's get into this video first i'm gonna be doing a dab and then we're gonna get right to eating them and uh and then i'll come back in about an hour 30 minutes i don't know whenever i start feeling it and let you see the results so here we go stab up [Music] [Music] before we eat these let's check out the package i'll show you the uh so berry cherry because it's basically the same as this one but it doesn't have a flavor on it so up top you got the medicated nerd got the ca over here tear and share 420 milligrams most of them say 400 milligrams some even say 500 but you could buy this package online empty and make your own so that's why it's sketchy buying these because you never know if they're real or fake what's in them but so that's it for the package you know the other side has some instructions warnings all that ingredients 60 minute activation so this package is basically the same it just has different milligrams 400 so combined these should be like 820 milligrams of thc so i should be pretty faded if that's accurate so there we go that's the package let's open these up and get right to it now i was gonna try to eat them both like at the same time you know but they're kind of melted so i might just have to do one at a time so let's start with the silvery cherry you can see it's all uh broken up in there i don't know if it's because it's so hot or what this is hot as hell today okay right there easy to open let's do it so very cherry i know there's going to be some nerves that fall out first you can't waste the nerds each one of those is like a micro milligram of thc oh [ __ ] yeah you could see it's kind of melted that's it for this one cheers another day another bake [Music] um okay definitely tastes weed already so that's a good sound now let's open up this one kind of tastes like cherry not very cherry but there's some cherry in there it's pretty good i like it could definitely taste the weed in it so now let's try this one all it says is uh medicated nerd bro super potent formula unknown strain let's see what this one's about don't want to lose any nerves you know even though the nerves don't have any bleed in it all the weeds in that gummy there we go it's all right there let's do it not really tasting any weed in that one [Music] i'm trying to think of the flavor i don't know [Music] but there we go second one down the hatch almost [Music] how's this flavor definitely like um the very cherry batter than this one now this one don't taste any weed so we'll see hopefully uh next time you see me i'm nice and faded i'm gonna grow up a j so when i come back we could smoke up get nice and stoned so let's see 60 minutes i'll be back all right back roll the j it's officially been 60 minutes a little bit longer and i'm pretty high i went for a little walk and i could definitely tell like i heard all the birds chirping i heard a lot of noises you know all the sounds were just hit me a little harder you know my eyes started feeling a little happier but i'm not that high so we're gonna rate it on a scale one through 420 and uh on a scale one through 420 i would have to say i'm gonna give it like a 300. so i'm pretty stoned but for eating two of these i should be passing out sleeping right now so let's light this j because i was talking to my mom and she said she had some of these but from the dispensary and she said that she she didn't really feel it but she doesn't really feel edibles either that's the same as me my tolerance is also really hot so usually adipose i don't feel i just get a little sleepy but i'm not even that tired i'm definitely high but i can always i might need about maybe six of those to get where i want to be but they're pretty good i don't know if i would recommend them off the street because with the black market truth is you never really know what you're getting anybody can make these you could buy these packages bulk online cheap make your own enemies cunning bears and nerds [Music] but if you could find these from the dispensary or after this pressure i would say go try them out because they're pretty good very cherry that's definitely good maybe if i had two of those i would have been extra extra faked but uh oh yeah getting high off candy who would have thought future is so cool you know living in the future getting [Music] cheers [Music] thanks for watching i appreciate you guys hit that thumbs up subscribe to the and hit the channel stay stoney live it up until next time guys [Music] still checking peace places",

and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a couple of thongs of snake oh my god I might not be able to smoke anything I don't really know that but we'll see from there yeah so cheers noise [Music] very tasty I did like them I do like Peter sweet son Peter sweets

without further ado here is the review of elder tree sap the tree sap maggots keep in here right now guys but I had to I was looking for bang for your buck and the tree sap this was 400 milligrams for this little thing it was only like 15 bucks so I figured we'd give it a try now first off guys I do want to say that my tolerance to edibles is just ridiculous I'm coming to the conclusion I don't know if I have something to my liver that makes stuff bypass differently or just the fact that I dab all day long but the four hunters didn't really do much to me personally I've had a lot of good feedback from them I heard a lot of good feedback from them but to me I mean it's uh it's a cannabis extract agave water and natural flavoring all that has is THC 400 milligrams so I've got the pitchers on the end but to me guys I mean when we're talking on packaging and everything 400 milligrams THC that's all it says you know is it just THC is a THC a is a delta-9 is a distillate is it actually you know what is it is it what's the full breakdown I mean again I would like to see a lot more on this other than just THC and if it is just THC at least let us know which one it is I assume it's delta-9 I'm converted over probably just a distillate I based or something but it doesn't say whether its water soluble says cannabis extract with the agave so I assume it's probably infused into the the agave and then just just mixed up in there y'all see the pictures on the end and I'll also have the little um when I was drinking at the flavor the flavor first is RI but it's got a definitely got a weird twang to it so that's not too terrible at first trailermate kinda got after flavor here's a nastiness in your mouth but don't quite go away this you need a chaser for the chaser on that one guys mmm for 100 milligrams we'll come back later with let you know goes it wasn't pleasurable for me if I had you know a final recommendation guys this isn't something that I personally liked it's it's I had to chug it even even in the mixture in Castillo had to chug it down because it was just such a weird twing afterwards and I just wanted to get it over with but yeah I mean if tree sap I want to see a lot more on there personally I we need a lot more than just four hundred milligrams me personally keep it up though see what else we do got the the flight bring I mean the flavouring wasn't terrible guys it was just it was weird it was if it just it just wasn't for me personally so there we go gasps that is tree sap you", "iKVMI3_j-OY": "hey what up homies welcome back to wheats today we are talking MILF and cookies again with their fancy new packaging and today we are looking at their 250 milligrams budge brownie no pan cookies sponge brownie let's read their ridiculous overwrought description on the back our fudge brownie will astonish even the most die-hard chocolate lover spoil yourself with this sinful blend of silky rich chocolate our brownies are deliciously dense with a moist intensely chocolaty interior somewhere between a chocolate truffle and a piece of fudge this confection will lead you into temptation and satisfy your chocolate fix we shall see about all that I don't know why these things so difficult to open but I'm looking for - so MILF and cookies we've reviewed a couple of their products in the past including I believe a chocolate chip cookie there's and a different brownie - slave right I found them to be all sort of middle-of-the-road edibles about average and I'm looking forward to try this brownie seeing how it fares with all the other brownies we have done thus far 250 milligrams is about normal for me in terms of potency oh it is a very very very falling apart brownie oh boy so it's incredibly crumbly a lot of the brownie feels like it's lost huh well let me show you guys so the packaging has left my brownie very crumbly which is kind of disappointing when you pay for it you know that's that's some money that's some product right there I'll take it up by crumbles anyway it doesn't matter all right let's give it a taste let's ignore those crumbs mmm I would describe it someone between a chocolate chocolate truffle and a piece of fudge no I wouldn't I would just grab his a shitty brownie um no we don't very little we'd taste but it's not a very good brownie it's it is fudgy er like they say not gonna confuse you for a chocolate truffle that's for sure but it's not bad it's small although I again must take on some point software it's very um crumbly nature there's again that is a significant part of your edible that has been reduced to crumbs okay well I'm gonna polish this bad boy off and as we all know it's not about how it tastes but rather about how it makes you feel so like with all our wheats reviews I will be back in two hours to let you guys know how this fudge brownie is making me feel thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we'll see you very soon bye welcome back to wheats we're talking MILF and cookies MILF and cookies brownie yes guys we're talking the 250 milligrams fudge milk-and-cookies brownie I didn't really like how it tasted I didn't really like how it all was crumbly and fell apart and hard to know if you're getting all your brownie or not even but I do I like how it makes me feel I gotta say I'm pretty pretty high um for a 250 milligram animal this seems to be on the upper end of that and it's a pretty affordable I think it cost me seven dollars maybe eight dollars I can't remember exactly seven or eight dollars so yeah pretty affordable doesn't taste great actually tastes pretty bad and it does have some problems when it comes to being too crumbly and falling apart in the package but still it got me pretty pretty faded so if you see the in open cookies bunch barely 250 milligrams at a dispensary near you wheat says go ahead and make that bad boy up you're not gonna be disappointed and with that thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any

probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria you would think on both of you were you Ray Oh ten nine hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make the og stoner snack infused brownies this is literally the easiest recipe to make I do a lot of baking at home myself but brownies are one of the things I always use a box mix for there's something about a store-bought brownie mix the honestly is just so good I'm also gonna show you guys a couple tips and tricks on how to make your brownies even better I hope you guys enjoy this video now let's get to baking like I said this is the easiest recipe and you can use any cake mix you can find I happen to have this giant cosmos icebox of RW brownie mix so we're going to use this one when it comes to making this the ingredients you're gonna use are gonna depend this on the back of your box so it's gonna call for like milk water eggs and butter or oil just the ratio would be different so you follow whatever is on your box and for my mix I need 1/3 of a cup of water 1/3 a cup of vegetable oil and one egg so what you need to do is wherever it says butter or oil you just replace that with your infused butter oil I have my oil here that I melted I do think you'd be better with butter than it would be with oil but I'm using what I have this says to preheat the oven to 325 degrees I already that force my oven is ready to go so the instructions on here say and these are going to be very similar for most box mix it's placed water oil and eggs in a mixing bowl and stir it until fully mixed so water oil and eggs and we need 1/3 of a cup of water just a little tip here some of these call for water someone call for milk and some him call for milk or water this one specifically calls for water and usually if it just calls for water it's because there's already a milk powder in here so we don't need the English additional amount of milk but it never hurts to add milk as well we only creamy value ingredients make everything taste better the end but these guard le ones are like super rich so we have our 1/3 cup of water will pour that in there we'll crank our 1 hag into there and then our most important ingredients are butter or oil like I said I have already warmed mine up so I can measure it out better and it calls for one third of a cup so on that for one third of a cup if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup or whatever cup you use whatever is on the box so I poured a little bit too much I'm just going to force them back a jar there we go so 1/3 of a cup going in to the mixing bowl and then we'll just mix that a lot let me add in the brownie mix it smells so good I love cookie dough but I really loved round batter too there's something about raw baked things that well before they're baked that is just like so delicious it'll of scraping off the raw batter off after now a little like extra tip is if you want things to be like extra rich and extra chocolaty you add a little bit of espresso or instant coffee I have a stress up here I'm going to add a tablespoon of this hope it's not going to be too chocolatey by adding this because these are deli ones are already so chocolatey to start with but the espresso just helps bring up the notes from the chocolate just like adds of a more complex layer to it so now we're just going to mix that all in there's so many trunks of like there's chocolate chunks in here already but if you're going to have that you can add America like you could throw in a bunch of chocolate chips at this point you could add in I'm M&Ms or Reese's Pieces or what love Reese's Pieces I'd be so good but yeah you'd be having anything you like sure and you want to add something like Oreos I would add them once this is fully mixed and then just like fold them in so they can get to chunked up I don't know and that's literally it that's all you have to do then we just have to pour it into our baking dish and cook them with the same amount of time that's been recommended on the box and they're good to go now we'll just line our dish with some parchment paper and we'll pour the brownian directly in this box says to cook them for 45 minutes that seems kind of long but I'll check in on them so I'm just going to talk this into the other and set a timer to check on it in 30 minutes to get really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually look under cook them a little bit but if you go overboard they'll be like really gooey and gooey which like I don't really mind it's like brownie batter but if you're ever trying to decide how long to cook it for always take it out a little bit before you think it should come out because it probably will taste better when it comes out the oven it dries a bit and then it will be like the perfect texture so the brownies are done I ended up cooking them for 45 minutes so I actually did do as long as the recipe said to do here's how they look they kind of came out a little bit lumpy because the way I put the parchment paper in there but that's all good I'm thinking of doing Detroit what you think I can do edible cookie cookie dough for the top layer before you eat the cookie dough 100 cooking the brownies I already did that these are gonna be really good I'm talking to you not like I'm talking to you but like I'm just like saying these are gonna be like tasty so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria oh fast we got the try brownie oh I would they look good feed me well I wish when should I have well that one's just taking vitamins you can eat the rest after yeah I think that one you would take on dog with you send it back hmm what's a boy were you Ray a 10-9 mmm what we did have you don't want it Oh Toledo is what to me is it peanut butter cookie oh no but it's like coconut oil video it's good compost the links with the cookie dough edible cookie dough delish well what I got a hair in it homies obviously mine", "EqkdA80Dty4": "Kito chocolate cake in one minute is what we've got on the menu today a few weeks back we did an entire keto chocolate cake recipe on the channel and I figured there's probably a good amount of you guys who don't either want to make an entire cake or you don't want to eat an entire cake because if you make one you have to pretty much commit to eating the entire thing that's why we're doing this quick and easy one-minute version of that keto chocolate cake with that being said let's jump right into the recipe so first things first we're going to get out our food scale to weigh out the ingredients for today's keto chocolate cake next we're also going to take out a small measuring cup because adding and mixing the ingredients for mug cakes in one cup and then cooking them in another in my opinion is the best way to make them anyways we're gonna add that cup to our food scale and then we're gonna start adding the ingredients for our one minute keto cake the first ingredient we'll want to add is going to be one large egg and we'll also want to beat that egg with a fork until the yolk totally combines with the white now want to get out the base of today's a low-carb chocolate cake which is blanched almond flour and we're using this because it has the lowest amount of net carbs compared to any other kinds of flour and actually for today's keto cake recipe we'll be using a quarter cup or 28 grams of it so once we've got that in the cup the next thing we're gonna do is add some sweetness and as always we're gonna do this without adding any carbs or calories by using confectioner swerve and for today's keto chocolate mug cake we'll only need to use a heaping tablespoon or 14 grams of it to add the perfect amount of sweetness to the recipe so now at this point we'll add some chocolate because of course we are making chocolate cake we need some chocolate and unsweetened cocoa powder is the perfect way to do this in a totally keto friendly way with that being said we're gonna add a tablespoon or five grams of it for our recipe today and lastly we're gonna add some baking powder to make the cake rise a little bit and a half a teaspoon of it should do the trick so now that we've added all of our ingredients we'll want to combine them with the spatula until a thick chocolaty batter forms once that does form want to about a mug fer keto mug cake but I'm gonna be honest with you guys ramekins like this one work way better than mugs do for mug cakes anyways the next thing wanted you is coat the mug thoroughly with baking spray and then we're gonna add all the keto chocolate cake batter to the mug once you taking care of that want a microwave our mug cake and just say guys know I have the weakest microwave ever made at seven hard what's and it takes somewhere around a minute and thirty seconds in my microwave but it's probably gonna take much less time in yours however if microwaves are not your thing and I totally get that you can always bake this keto chocolate cake in the oven all you have to do is set your oven to 350 degrees and bake it for around 12 minutes so once it's done baking you want to remove it from the oven let it cool down completely in the ramekin itself and then check this out once it cools down this is what the keto chocolate cake ends up looking like how delicious does this thing look as always for more information about today's keto chocolate cake check the video description below I hope you enjoy it", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "yl2ZwM-xVd8": "hey guys what's up my name is Manny and this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out brownie by Botanica Seattle also by spot Seattle I'm not 100% sure like how to tow I think it's spot is the brand anyway this is supposed to be just a regular classic brownie you guys see the giant like 10 milligram sticker on it as far as the packaging goes this is pretty nice like it feels like an upscale like if you're gonna pay for a ten dollar brownie then you might as well like get some nice packaging with it in the back it says classic brownie it takes between 30 and 60 minutes to feel the full effects which should last for two to three hours it could take up to two hours before you get an effect so even if you wait an hour and you haven't felt it yet give it another half hour before you take like another half a brownie and then it's off it also says made with some grown cannabis all butter infused for enhanced flavor in effect always safe natural and tested they also give you which I don't think I've seen this too much in cannabis packaging but they give you all of the health information down there like as far as like your the fat content sugar your calories and all that stuff that's all in there which is pretty nice considering they probably didn't have to do that necessarily so with that I'm just gonna go ahead and pop it open I know normally I say I don't like I'm not gonna ingest or I'm not gonna like be intoxicated on camera but with this being an edible I can eat it and talk to you about like the flavor and how it like tastes without you know without being stoned or anything like that so we're gonna give this a go that was hard to open not that part but we could have made it easier for myself just kind of on me so these things out it's a pretty basic dense like brownie I'm gonna go ahead and rip it open for you guys so you can see the inside so it's just a regular it's pretty dense I'm not gonna lie so I'm gonna go ahead try it so oh that's rich it's not rich as in like super strong in chocolate but it has this like me personally I don't like dairy so anytime I taste like dairy at all it kind of makes my stomach feel a little funky but no tastes of cannabis once so ever this tastes like a healthy brownie there we go it tastes like a brownie where somebody was like you know what I'm gonna use cacao not it's chocolate or something along those lines um it tastes it's kind of chalky a little bit dry as to be expected with a brownie that's in a package yeah you definitely have to chew khat I wish I could compare this to something I can't though it's a really really mild by little chocolate flavor if you don't like chocolate that's another thing I don't like chocolate a lot so the fact that this is edible for me is pretty good so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and finish this up and I will be back probably later today or tomorrow morning depending on how this thing goes it's a sativa brownie so I should have fallen my ass but we will find out anyway this is Manny this was this is a classic brownie review the company who made this was but tanyka seattle and i will be back tomorrow with your results hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that brownie and I'm not gonna lie it didn't do what it was supposed to it is just a 10 milligram brownie so possibly it could have just been that like I since I've been smoking regularly for about two years that it just happened to not work for me that doesn't that's not say that it won't work with you just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean that your body's gonna react the exact same way so if you're kind of like I would say this is a good another good like intro to edibles if if you're new to the edible thing but you want to like maybe try it that this would be a good like icebreaker into that room just because it is so mellow that you'll get that like behind the eyes like feeling but you're not gonna like you're not gonna feel hi or at least not super super intense it's still not bad it was like I said the flavor wasn't terrible for me personally the high just wasn't that great but if you're new and want to try something for the first time then this is definitely something to give a shot to or give give a chance to but yeah anyway my name is Manny this has been recreational 4/20 and I'll see you guys again

on a late night in Saturday night and I was uh I was at a friend of Mines house another artist friend of mine by the name of salvo and you'll be seeing a lot of him and Julius DeWitt Hannah coming out of Cleveland this year the arts worldwide but for now what I want to do tonight courtesy my [ __ ] salvo that is a thousand milligram brownie I have to go to Walmart because I have no milk here for my daughter so I figure out what hop on here I mean that's I don't usually eat brownies and that's a whole lot of brownie I don't even know if I can get through this then taste like we too so this one's for salvo my [ __ ] said he took it anyone ready for my favorite part of the brownie is the edge [Music] once we get them apart they look like [Music] now I guess it's a marvelous own heart blondie but the part of it that tastes like a cookie is bottled and then the crazy part I gotta go to Walmart cuz I got to know all the way I don't know if I'm gonna finish that this is like the first thing I hate all day too a lot what I'll be up strictly off the sugar that's all I got and justice sits that's a bottle tastes like vinegar it is what is it that was a and probiotic drinks but his lemon cayenne but anything to get this thick as brownie though Cheers yes [Music] [Music] all right covers a lot yeah so I'm gonna pause the video go handle my fitness and I'll be back I'll let you know how that brownie alright so it's been it's been almost two hours we've been about about about an hour and 45 minutes and about 20 minutes ago I said I said man all I am is full I came down here sat down for about 20 minutes I feel like somebody just dropped a ton of bricks on me I'm [ __ ] up yeah so I don't know if I'm [ __ ] up enough where I'm about to help be hallucinating and [ __ ] my tolerance is pretty high but a shout-out to whoever made the Cookie Monster brownies fire extra fire are they're not evil I can't front I can barely talk so I don't know what type of video this is gonna be I might just have to hold it down til tomorrow I don't know it's uh it's definitely the rift it it's definitely the room 2,000 milligrams I don't know or maybe my tolerance is just maybe there's a thousand dollars yes I feel like I got hit with it I feel like I got hit with an elephant tranquilizer that's hot [Music] yeah I was uh I was sitting up here looking at some some rattles some dying of apps and I kind of get kind of got lost in that if this is a thousand milligrams is definitely a different animal but here again I say I was in Vegas and I bought a cheaper shoot and it was a hundred milligrams and I ate it and I couldn't walk so I don't know I was a little ground ton of milligrams maybe they're not using the same measure I really don't know but I know that I'm really stoned right now might be time for me to get into a new Orion you get sent back to them and I guess they just rebuilt in so I really don't know what they did but it hasn't been the same sense since they sent it back I think what I'm gonna do is get another cavity by Kelly burns or go 20 was 20 30 bucks something like that all right that's it for me it Terp to heck peace so it's been like four hours since I ate that whole brownie and I am absolutely toasted why I can't wear hurts can't even describe I'm toasted then oh I'm sitting up here perusing the Internet's and I'm just extremely high right now so I'm they put this in another video because as the schema having ideas you know ideas after ideas after ideas and I'm sitting here and I'm looking at this whiteboard and I know that I have a lot of work to do you know I have all of my friends are extremely talented you know we have decided to try everything you know not everything you know but you know just a different approach to some things that we've done in the past and with a little more vigor and relying less on other people and more on ourselves yeah I'm not that high I'm just the most high right now and his heater sounds gonna be in the video but that's okay kind of like white noise and it keeps me from my ear ringing stuff it was quiet down man so I had to uh I realized that I was dehydrated then I started thinking when you uh man I just keep like sauna now but it's a good zone out I'm like I look over here and I have an idea I got a bunch of it you know I'm just you know these were Wow like I said a thousand milligrams at all I know it was for me anyway because I don't eat a lot of sweets it was hard to eat so I don't know if this I don't know if where I'm at is worth eating that much sugar but don't get me wrong I'm enjoying where I'm at I'm absolutely enjoying where I'm at all right so apparently I'm not that buck anymore wanted to do it there yeah I would definitely say I'm geeked off to brown no doubt still nothing beats that not you could do a lot of things by the wraparound a summer Oh I like having the I need another diner quarrel definitely need a noted on the corner so my battery's low thousand milligrams done - dabs after and what you didn't know is that I ate two of these gummies before it supposedly these are you know 500 milligrams you know maybe my tolerance I don't know you

you know your page that you bought the color today - what is going on YouTube it's your voice every TV back end with another finger for you as Manuel you guys are gonna be watching this video home for 20 right so I got something special for you guys so the company working for this month hooked it up fat I'm talking about they hooked it up so right here man I got three boxes of a thousand milligram at bulls and gummies gum music alright now just regular edibles gummies so let me let me go ahead and show you guys real quick so right here we got thousand milligram mixed fruit gummies by a company that I've obviously been working with if you guys haven't seen them already they are called standard I'm gonna go ahead and put all their info down in the description below so you guys can go ahead and check them out and I think I don't know listen man I don't know if I should I don't think I'm gonna consume all three boxes because I do want to do a table prank on one of my friends or what I'm like you know and just do have them take because I got hooked up with these right here and these are not edible so what I'm thinking about doing is doing a prank on someone with one of these boxes but today I'm thinking about maybe taking two what do you guys think man I'm thinking we should do too good I'm gonna show you guys when you guys get this got a box if you everyday man I'm not really too sure I haven't actually opened them so I'm gonna go ahead and check out what flavors I got from myself right so there is ten pieces in here as you can see on the box right there and I'm guessing so you got an orange right here two oranges another orange but they're kind of different shades so maybe they're different types of like orange flavoring then right here you got two green you got a blue raspberry I'm assuming got a fruit punch what else you got another fruit punch blue raspberry and another orange man I think the orange one is their best one so I'm gonna go ahead and dump both of these boxes out on a plate and then I'm just gonna get to munch a man because these are a lot of gummies man these are gonna be 20 whole 10 milligrams per piece gummy so I don't even know if I'm ready for this boys hi guys so I ended up only just pouring out the tent the first thousand milligrams because I felt like 20 gummies is just way too much to eat in one sitting so I'm gonna do just a thousand milligrams this video but if you guys want us to get two thousand and three thousand milligrams at it we'll go ahead and run up the likes on this video and let the LED standard themselves know on Instagram that you guys want to see that challenge happen alright that way they could provide me with more goods so before anything though I want to show you guys this sick a shirt that they provided for me also it says standard the ultimate standard and it has it also on the sleeves I think I might have a coupon code for this so if you guys want to cop it I'm gonna go ahead and put it down in description below and yeah man let's get to eat here goes the first one I'm not too sure which flavor is which I must just assuming that the green one is sour apple because I have had the sour apple once before so I'm gonna go ahead and munch down on all of these men and I'm gonna give you guys the taste of every single one of them which I'm gonna tell you guys if they are if they taste like THC or anything like that some of Cheers [Music] now was this our Apple home for sure super fine like I remembered it and he doesn't it doesn't taste like like TC at all like I'm telling you it only has that little edible aftertaste that I feel like all edibles have so this one right here I'm assuming is the blue raspberry choose fire alright go ahead and I'm the watermelon I'm assuming you don't wanna do I'm a genius I I'm assuming this one orange is orange red up I can't tell can't tell if it's peach or orange one of those two so right here we go from the last one I might I'm thinking this one's pineapple definitely pineapple I'm assuming so those were five right chuni it doubled up on the all the flavors and we got here we got the last five so I'm gonna just go ahead and much down boys Cheers [Music] so all our chewing boys sorry if you guys to hear that [Music] who any water milligrams down the hatch that was not bad at all it's actually pretty enjoyable so I'm just waiting for these to kick in man and I'm gonna update you with you guys I'm updating you guys with what happens I mean I'm kind of scared the last time I took 700 700 milligrams of edibles I I blocked out almost so well we're gonna wait we're gonna see and I'll get back to you guys in a little bit mm-hmm all right ladies and gents so I just came to store real quick before they smell this um edible hits man holy [ __ ] it might be hitting as we speak but it's only been 30 or 40 minutes so I'm not - I don't think it really will I'm assuming it takes usually an hour and a half to two hours like it usually does so I came to the store real quick to grab some drinks and some snacks just in case I'm not able to drive later because a thousand milligrams is a dangerous amount all right so my eyes they are starting to get a little bit red I am starting to feel a little bit stomach pain I'm not gonna lie am i because I've only eaten one thing this morning it was just a little pancake so and it's already a 1:00 1:30 yeah so um I'm gonna go ahead and go in grab my [ __ ] drive back home and I'm hoping praying that it doesn't hit while I'm in the store because if it does I'm in a big I'm in some big trouble man I'm in some big trouble I'm not gonna be able to drive home definitely do not drive home under the influence man yeah and that that brings me to my next case only be watching my videos if you're 18 or 8 or 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state years already know that YouTube makes me say that stuff just for so they don't strike my channel and I get deleted you know so yeah

know all the times I haven't been this like smacked in a while I have been it's been definitely a lot of times as I've been this might them finally like just in my own thoughts right now and hmm luckily it's not like overpowering it's not like crazy like right in my head you know and it makes me it doesn't it doesn't really make me want to go sleep but if I do want to like just definitely definitely wanted to sit down and just relax man a little break down though those gummies definitely the hit in between I want to see I went half to two hours that was the time frame when I started really feeling like that like it started kicking mostly in the head I started feeling in the head at first and then definitely started feeling any more on the body once I got home I was just like oh my goodness and I started sweating a little bit more it's definitely just because I feel like I'm overthinking a lot of things and things but honestly yeah it's crazy and I definitely didn't know what what to expect going into this but yeah the crazy experience [Music] at this point I just kind of just want to sit down and just like really [Music] don't worry about anything but honestly the overall experience man is it really really freaking good like I honestly haven't enjoyed something this this like of this stature I thought honesty was going to be a different whole crazy different experience

I've been super money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "4h8sTpIMn10": "what's up everybody so this is something I want to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "JUhehJbStUU": "alright let's build a baker and we finished cooking our butter you did it for 24 hours and then what I do is I come over here I've got kind of a homemade press I put some cheesecloth in here I put my weed in I put that on top and then I take a couple C clamps and I just squeeze every bit of the butter out that I can get and so as I had said I'd do about an ounce per stick of butter I did go a little heavy this time and it's this one this batch came out pretty dark what you want to do is you take your water and butter combo cuz it's all mixed together at that point and you just leave it in your crock pot or your pan or whatever and you chill it overnight and what will happen is all the butter will float to the top of the water you should get a nice little butter disc now this is hard it's not usually this hard should have done this before the video but I got a slotted spoon here you can just separate it and I'll tell you what that water that's down under there you'll see it in a minute that is nasty you just want to here it goes alright get it so I can grab it woohoo alright so this is our disc of butter and that's the nasty water down there I was talking about I will take my slotted spoon and go through that and recoup any a little bit here's another tip you got some weed on here you can just scrape this off with a spoon or something I'll go ahead and do that and then I'll put it in a pan and I've warm it up and I take a half cup measuring cup which is equal to one stick of butter and then I'll put those half cups into it their own ziploc bag so when I go to make a batch of brownies I just pull out one stick of butter and I find going with the one ounce per stick of butter rule that my brownies come out to about 400 milligrams now I know this because when I was out of brownies and I had to buy him out of the dispensary I had to get at least a 400 milligram edible to equal one of my brownies so again you just let this cool overnight the butter will float to the top and it'll harden scrape this up melt it down put it in half cups if you want you know what you do then is up to you but make sure you dump this outside or in the toilet or something you know this is just nasty stuff so that's it that's how build a Baker does butter for pot brownies enjoy", "5A-TkeUcsLU": "gorilla goddess today Kenna lovely here the canna critic is going to be doing a can of review on guerrilla goddess a new", "OsEnqbGHlWk": "hello everybody so I'm going to be recording this whole video on my phone for convenience and just shelled out mode my last video was pretty chilled out too but I just want to start enjoying making YouTube videos again because I feel like lately I've been feeling that I need to record on my good camera all the time I need to have the best editing I need to have it perfect but you know it I just want to show my life I want to you know share with you a video like today what I eat in a day so I do fast so my first real meal isn't until around like 3 o'clock and yeah I only have really a snack before I work out for like some carbs so my carbs are usually some sort of rice cake or you know something along those lines you look like that little rice cakes nothing new they are actually corn thin corn thins oh this is the cheese flavored but that one is like the sesame flavored sesame something so they look like that but not cheese these are really good too I love these with tuna salad I mix some tuna with mayo and onions and peppers and then I put it on these and it's like tuna nachos or something but these are really good alternative to like Cheetos or any cheesy chip because they have the crunch but it's only 5 carbs 28 calories for one slice so you can't beat that so I had 5 of those this morning or 500 the corn fins this morning and then I will show you my lunch right now so for lunch I'm making egg white omelet with beef fajita and this is a very lazy girl mail prep I could have easily bought some beef steaks and Grill this up and then cut them into pieces but I bought this this was around like 7 to 8 bucks for all of this and there's four point five servings and here are the macros pretty good low-fat barely any carbs protein so I always tell people don't be afraid of seasonings because it makes your food taste good and makes dieting a lot easier and eating healthy in general so I love to add some Himalayan pink salt and this salt free garlic and herb seasoning I love garlic and also this Trader Joe's everything but the bagel seasoning dude this is amazing it has sea salt garlic and onion all my favorite things can't forget tried-and-true one only love not actually ground Cayenne red pepper amazing if you love salty or spicy wow that's cooking over there I'm gonna cut up my Apple and I'm also gonna dip it into some peanut butter but not any peanut butter I'm gonna be using this powdered peanut butter and I'm gonna turn it into like a little dipping sauce so all I did was take half a serving which is 6 grams and now I'm gonna add some water and stir it up and it's gonna be like a little peanut butter sauce that I can do [Music] so this is my very quick very easy lunch and I'm gonna be having it with the rest of us mandarin orange sparkling water I definitely recommend this Raley's brand but more so the Walmart sparkling water brand I forgot what it's called I'll probably add it on the screen right now and also if you have trouble getting your water in like you don't like the taste of plain water I recommend me oh it's like a squeezy bottle that you just squeeze into your water you don't need much and no calories and this flavor is really good orchard apple and it has some B vitamins in it Crystal Light is really good too but it does have calories to it so if you add a little bit too much then you got to account for the calories so there's that I'm gonna have my lunch and get back to you when I have my pre dinner lunch lunch number two so I must add that I am trying to lose weight right now mostly just loose fat I don't really care really that much about the weight but if I lose weight you know it's a given when you're trying to lose fat I'm only showing you what I eat in a day not so you can copy it and eat the same foods exact foods because every body is different you may need less food to lose weight you may need more food to lose weight in a healthy manner I'm a short female so I require less Lube in the normal like female I do have a high activity level but still it's very hard to catch up in terms of metabolism and you know the calories that I burn in a whole day I think that I probably burn around 2,000 calories in a day and that's including walking around campus going to the gym doing a little bit of cardio and then just like regular activities but if you are curious to know how many calories you may burn know today it it is an estimate I will link a playlist that I filmed it is a series called like how calories work and it'll I'll teach you like calories and versus calories out so the food that you eat will either you know make you gain weight and make you lose weight that's just the way it is so now that that's out of the way I'm gonna go digest my food and wait till lunch number two so my next meal actually ended up being a little close to dinner it was 6:30 and we usually have dinner at 7:30 but I am going to make a little tortilla breakfast sandwich using a lot tortilla factory to eat tortilla and then these Morningstar sausage patties that are veggie and they're super good and I'm going to show you the macros here so I have two of those and I was warming up a tortilla and some low-fat mozzarella cheese and just waiting for it to melt so it looks like a sad face but this is my pre dinner I'm just gonna make it into a little tortilla breakfast tortilla [Music] so while I'm eating this snack I'll be cooking dinner and what I'm having for dinner are these amazing beyond meat beastly sliders it is vegan so it's not meat but it tastes amazing first slider it's about 100 calories I'm gonna have two and then I'm also gonna make some what are these called what are these called they're onions but [Music] caramelized onions oh my god so I just chopped up some onions and then I'm gonna sear them and let them caramelize in this Land O'Lakes light butter one serving is 50 calories so slower fat than normal butter and then I'm gonna make some oh I'm gonna make some fries in the airfryer one of my favorite kitchen appliances these are my favorite low fat french fries you can buy it store there you go looks like that crinkle cut so I'm gonna put a serving I could put two two servings I think cuz I didn't really I think I've some carbs left while I wait for my food to cook I wanted to sorry I'm chewing gum I wanted to touch on something that I haven't tried before but I heard there are a lot of benefits to it and that is gelatin so I bought a big tub herb bag this was actually not that expensive it was a bit about 10 a little over 10 bucks I kind of think I'm lying but grass-fed pasture-raised be elegant Bell Bell Judas a lot of benefits to gelatin include gut health bone health hair it's basically cooked bones from animals this is beef people tend to use these this in recipes such as like fudge or I'm gonna try in a brownie protein brownie later I've also seen a cookie recipe and I'm very excited to try that too so I'm going to be experimenting with this and then maybe I'll make a whole video on the different recipes that I have tried and successfully made with the gelatin it's all protein so 45 calories for a serving and it's all the 9 Cal 9 grams of protein because 9 times 4 is 9 times 4 is 36 so it's 36 calories why'd you put 45 you could have rounded up to 40 not rather am I doing this wrong no I'm not wrong anyway I'm gonna be using this later so we're gonna figure this out together gelatin let's see if this barbecue sauce hinders macros are good so I'll be drizzling baton this having this and then also having some spring mix on the side because health so it's about nine o'clock now and I have to wake up early to take my final tomorrow my final final until spring or summer class starts so I'm going to be making a gelatin protein brownie now I know what you're thinking what the but apparently gelatin makes desserts chewy and I love myself a chewy brownie and our idea to make a chewy protein brownie so let's try it out and if it works then I will put the recipe in the description below so you can try it out yourself so I've added all the dry ingredients in here which are basically here again I will put the recipe in the description if this works out well I'm going to make them into brownie cookies rather than like I was gonna put it in this but I feel like it's not gonna cook very fast so I'm gonna just make it into burning cookies so the consistency is looking promising like I can honestly just eat it like this but let's cook it I'm gonna have a fiber lumber undercooked sounds good and I still have some parts left and I need some fiber look at the chewiness that's good so I've been like adding this this whipped cream topping on top of the brownie cookies and it's like little whoopie pies and oh my gosh like I can't explain to you how good this is and the more you let it cool down the more chewy it is but it's so good that I mean I'm so impatient that I want to just eat it right now all right guys it's about that time it's about time to go to bed just before 10 o'clock I am a grandma and I am proud so I hope you enjoyed today's full day of eating it's like I was hanging out with you I was cooking and I had a revelation when I tasted the brownie cookies and oh my goodness I'm gonna keep making them until I'm sick of all they're so good so again the recipe will be down in the description below so you can try it out yourself thank you for watching and I will see you in the next video", "qdiHPvmeJaY": "what do you got there an edible you want to give it to him you think i'm going to take food from a stranger you say cher this dude's got a lollipop for you who makes that roofie um [Laughter] lollies by roofie we got weed smokers in here tonight no are you an edible guy or is that just for me well they're yours they're yours are you make them you made that lollipop let me see that you first of all man it's if you gave me a million dollars and you're like go make a lollipop i'd be like wow now how many milligrams are in each one of these how would i know that yeah i can't wait to dig into these i guess [Applause] how many milligrams i don't [ __ ] i'm not eating them i don't know this is by the way this is this is old school before there were stores this is old school edibles remember when you could eat half of a brownie you're like i'm not high and the other person you ate the other half is like [ __ ] up [Laughter] remember when the edibles were just started you had no idea where the weed went in the pan you're like i have eight and 12 cookies i'm not high i ain't one i'm gonna die like you know what i mean [Applause] [Music] so you don't know okay do you know how much weed you used eight ounces and in what type of weed eight ounces in a gallon of honey that sounds like a clint eastwood movie clint eastwood in eight ounces and a gallon of honey oh you got the honey too is there weed in the honey okay now now now let me ask you another question and then we'll get on to the show uh what what do these taste like california it tastes like california can you describe that for me [Applause] did you see what she did i would describe that and she went which is right we're in california what what do these taste like watermelon okay and this this tastes like honey [Music] look i feel like you'd be disappointed in me if i didn't i mean it doesn't bode well that i can't open it up why now listen i will tell you like this the reason i'm going to eat this particular can is because i'm a textured texture guy when i eat you know what i mean some foods that i like the way they taste but the texture like uh like man like you if i bite into a brown part of a banana it is [ __ ] over for me but this is i will see what the deal is with the texture on this because what are those what are those halloween candies that like are in the shape of like an orange slice no not candy corn but the worst the worst the worst halloween candy is that [ __ ] peanut butter oh that [ __ ] peanut whatever that [ __ ] thing is you give me a peanut i am [ __ ] in your mailbox that's what's happening oh yeah that was a nice candy all right here we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] well i have to tell you there's definitely weed in that [Applause] [Music] i don't know if it's in all of them but it's in that [ __ ] one for sure god sam i'm gonna tell you because i just ate a little pill that was just gonna get me going a nice little pill and that was just 50 milligrams just to have fun on stage but no no it's not really that much when you take them every day but that one really tasted like that got dipped in the sauce you know what i mean [Applause] yeah we'll see what happens everybody i might end up sitting down there with you [Applause] you want one let's just lock the doors and get [ __ ] [Applause] up [Music] [Music] you", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help it it's you know if I'm not high I'm not high thank you so much for

don't know about that part but i would say if it works you would just get some uh grind up some mushrooms and a coffee grinder some [ __ ] like that where they need a powder form dump them in the brownie mix you're not really gonna be able to tell unless you got like a i don't know how the recipe or whatever for that would be like the ratio to how many brownies to the milligram edge or

off of it there's a bunch of different ways you can do it with um with the mushrooms anyone has shrimp tea the only thing with shrimp tea is same thing with like the brownies or whatever what's up

hell yeah man i hope you like this video hope you're smoking on some good okay i'm gonna uh i forgot but hell yeah later holy [ __ ]", "MF7NsMhjEio": "all right what is up everybody Jacob's coming back with in another video a little bit of a different set up I'm not really on center with this bigger house blanket that's because I got all this [ __ ] here today and what we're gonna be doing is making some edibles with with you guys fare I went to the store got some cheap ass butter real quick got this old like crock-pot [ __ ] ready to go heat it up on low as you know and it's a smoke show I got brownies for one and then um two little bags of cookies some chocolate chip cookies I got the crock-pot right here it's on low and the way I'm gonna be making this butter isn't gonna be able to but it's gonna be with we love my hospital a little wristbands stuck to the bag tore it off now there's a hole in my bag of trim which is [ __ ] great not just a whole bag out a little bit on the floor but basically I got a bunch of shrimp here in another bag right here we're making a lot of edibles not all on camera but just basically showing you guys how to do it I got this what are you already said butter but I'm gonna be making it with shrimp and four sticks of butter take this book top off got this little like it's like a home it's like a para no it's just like the met lab version of like a weed making setup I don't know very homey and trashy is kind of what I feel but I already made some cookies and all these they came out pretty good they've been getting me [ __ ] baked I'm definitely getting high people are like oh you have to deke are of your weave which I've done before I've put like my trimming or my weed and the oven did he carve it and then put it in the butter and [ __ ] but I don't think it matters either way because the whole warming process is also in this so I just don't I don't know I did it I don't think it makes difference it might help or might not help either way these edibles I was making to get me [ __ ] high that's maybe because I really don't measure out the amount of trim I put in there at all I basically just put as much of it as I can fit in there with like the liquid ratio so well you know I believe this is still awakened baked too so we're getting drunk and high in the morning making edibles with y'all mmm and thumper don't forget thumper I'll show you guys thumper I'll show you guys what I got going on right here see what we got going on here this is the butter in the pot it's on low right as you can see there's like little weed remains from the last little batch I made but there's just like a little bit of water in there just enough so like the butter is like kind of still out of the water just a little thumper baby chillin highest cat you know what we're working with right now we got this all melted we got this all melted now good to go baguette rim right here little nubs they're just like weren't worth but basically I'm just gonna take this basically just gonna put as much weed as I can fit in here now where it would still be like an OK ratio trying to get so no Jaime a little extra [Music] there we go and this is a good amount I guess where the amount that I wouldn't normally make if I were to make these you want to like perfect so I got that put the top on and just oh I'll let this sit here for like a full day like I don't know anywhere between like 1216 hours and just kind of get up and stir it um whenever I remember to get some better lighting over here but basically already I've taken just the big like leaves out and put it on top of the cheesecloth will be the pull obviously and then that's the rest of the water and butter that's gonna be in there so I got all of the leaves in this I'm gonna try to get as much of the butter out of the leaves as I can for her actually no I don't know do I need to put the rest of this through this first so we're gonna do that this shit's gonna be pretty hot Foster just like this all right so they're you know I got this big-ass thing of trimming a big ball of trimming soaked in butter hmm so for this just get as much of the potency out of it as you possibly can you just want to squeeze the [ __ ] out of this get all the juice now whatever I mean just just a butter full of basically dark [ __ ] you guys but that's what it looks like disgusting disgusting but it's nothing gave me real great in high soon so check back when the butter has cooled I'm gonna put that bowl in the fridge for however long until it is cool and yeah I'll come back at you think [Music] [Music] tastes a shit-ton like weed but pretty good cookie labels turned out pretty good I would say that the brownies tasted a lot better any time I do fudge brownies it's a lot less like we D of the taste I don't really taste it as much yeah cookies it was a lot more like if you just picked up that cookie without knowing it you would definitely know it's a weed cookie cuz you can just you can just smell the cookie and you know it's [ __ ] it reeks of weed pretty much but yeah I still probably just look stoned I feel stones this is my first joint I guess so maybe wake me up it's probably just gonna put me back to sleep that's what I have just been kind of doing I like I like doing this a lot better like getting trim from the guy trim for and then just getting some butter and doing this whole process rather than spending like 50 bucks on a one good edible for just like one good high that like might or might not work you know it's like it's nice to like make a bunch of can of butter and then just kind of keep it in your fridge for just any time you want to make cookies or brownies or some [ __ ] like that you know I've even done like if I've been lazy before and like I don't want to like actually make a whole batch of cookies or something so I'll take like a little bit of can of butter I'll just straight up put it on some toast put some jelly on that and yeah the jelly kind of helps it's definitely a little lady in you have to persevere through it but I mean it's not that bad for getting as high as you will get but ya know that's pretty much the video you guys on how to make homemade edibles like I said you can just do it that way or just put like a pot right on your stove well yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the video I'm sure you will believe any tips anything you guys you know I don't know constructive criticism and you know drop a comment let me know if you guys were smoking with me 'we are smoking from india i hope you

breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching this review and we have nearly

didn't even have a chance to freakin record yeah I was having too much fun great mom yeah she was done yeah some of you guys day which was so awesome yep and I know that was something you guys looking for us that knows this was the most packed event in Hawaii next event we were probably gonna go to decadence Arizona probably gonna stop and Cali first and road trip into Arizona where she's from she's also from New Mexico - well yeah yes and just cruising around Arizona again it was like oh boy James how come you're not bring you here so he's bragging we went to the carnival after the event with our friends we had some clips but it just didn't make sense cuz we're just recording nonsense yes because very pretty gone to you that night imagine rolling at the event that's I mean at the carnival that'd be funny oh that would be scary and I already got dizzy off the first ride we went to I was like FBI recording everything but today's video guys will be showing you guys and reviewing Adrienne's product personal stuff that she likes because I don't like doing it edibles gummy worms yes can see hey Nick they're 400 milligrams which means 4 grams of weed was basically melted into 10 gummy worms if I'm getting correct please let me know is what I'm going off from what other youtubers said and I'm pretty sure the dispensary lady told us that too and Kelly so I tried 3 out of 10 I tried the first one dude I was like so I was like - I was laughing away it was pretty good um if you're used to edibles you're gonna need like a full not a half if you're barely beginning in edibles and a half would be good for you but I have didn't do much for me I was waiting for it to kick in for like 30 minutes and then nothing and then I waited for an hour so it just depends on your body so I made a 10 out of 10 because you can't taste the cannabis and the warm eyes could pay to other edibles you would eat your candy yeah this one it taste is like pure candy like appeared candy gummy worms which I was social how about you eat half right now and then I'll take a DAB hit with you because I can't have that I know you guys can relate whenever I [ __ ] eat edibles I get freaking yes again get paranoia [ __ ] it's so weird I mean this is my future here but not a J is right there Oh within Cheers I don't know which pen should we take it out from I picked this up AJ's rainbow unicorn Cheers I guess you really know a thing adhesive like candy I just don't get it if you see these normally if I do eat edibles like I would eat it and then so right now guys so I mean right now now right now today so we don't record for you guys and hopefully be more consistent upload every other day if anything we're gonna go grab some Starbucks SB because I'm hunger we'll see what this day consists of where they is go coral double warm so what do you think about edibles comment down below the edge like them watching his favorite what happened when you guys had your trip yeah Micah's edibles you don't know they hit like twice the time consuming longer so it doesn't hit right away which means take our to and that's why people tend to overdose on edibles because the yeah so see you

whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe

when picking out the box dessert you want to make sure it doesn't have milk and it's made with organic sugar this may take a little bit of searching but an ease is usually a safe bet as well as somebody Crocker and Duncan Hines boxes that are accidentally vegan so just check out the ingredients real quick and you might be surprised with how easy it is to find today I'm making a nice organic cookie brownie bar baking mix this recipe does call for butter as well as eggs so we're going to have to find some replacements for that as for butter the easiest solution would be vegan butter of course and that's what I'm going to be using today another thing that you could also use is margarine canola oil coconut oil or even applesauce the brownie part of this recipe does also call for one egg and there's a few egg replacers out there like energy egg replacer or Bob's Red Mill but today I'm using nee egg other ways to replace egg in recipes would be to use a flax egg tofu vegan yogurt pumpkin puree or mashed banana [Music] all you do is mix this powder with water and you have an egg so other than that I'm following this recipe to a tea I'm just doing exactly what the instructions say but with my replacements with the Browning portion of it it was a little dry using the nee egg so I did add just a little bit of water about a tablespoon and it worked out just fine for the cookie part of this recipe I did use coconut oil instead of butter and it was really awesome it was a texture that worked really well for the cookies this recipe called for a normal baking pan of course that makes sense but I did not have one of those so I used a cupcake tin with liners the only thing that I would recommend is to make sure that you either have good liners or you spray them with a little bit of oil because I did have a hard time getting these out it is just that easy we have a really awesome dessert with just a couple replacements a lot of these can just be found in your house anyway check out the description box below for a link to my website where I list all the replacements for both eggs and butter as well as the amounts thanks so much for watching like and subscribe to a brand

anything about DC or just you know the cannabis life there you know that Sunny Patch was popular for a while and so things started to get a little weird my really really reliable pop-up shop lady stopped carrying these because she said they stopped putting actual cannabis inside of these edibles and you know at first when I would get these from this woman they provided the best experience a very powerful you know it was a very powerful high and the best part is like you know you didn't have to smoke weed because you could just pick these really yummy sour candies but when I made my first videos on stony patch a lot of people were telling me oh no this stuff isn't real this stuff is you know hogwash this stuff is fake and I was like I don't know what you're talking about the first several times that I got sunny patch packages it was like the best thing I've ever experienced and oh just a heads up cannabis is completely legal in Washington DC DC if you know anything about DC you know that there are no legal issues with consuming consuming cannabis okay alright so with that said now that we know so knee patch is unreliable altogether there is no centralized provider for stony patch I just want to talk about some alternatives so I know a lot of people are not in the DC area but if you're in a DC area and you want kind of reliable edibles then you know what I think a good alternative would be this this is Capital confections - came in here yeah yeah - came inside and the gummies are in the shape of puzzle pieces and I'll just take these out these are really good as well so it looks like this gummy and the gummy is sugarcoating oh it's hard okay so it smells sour and really kind of a sieve and the directions on the back I'm gonna read them for you they say nibble half of one gummy and wait one hour before consuming more I think that's a good idea cuz this is this also tends to be really strong I don't know if these particular gummies these gummy edibles are as strong as the first time I tried the good stony patch ones but a lot of people here on my channel had been telling me that when they try a sunny patch nothing happens it's fake like just nothing is happening so with that said in the fact that the supplier lady stopped carrying these all together I think it's safe to say that for a lot of people who Sony patch was like a scam but I promise for me the first time I tried sunny patch it was not a scam and the reason why I'm like making this video is because I finally got confirmation from the lady that introduced me to this edible that yeah this is a no-go now okay so this is why I am suggesting maybe if you are in DC try this and hopefully you'll get a better experience with this one okay so if you have any more questions you can let me know um [Music] these tastes really good and I like them and yeah they'll do but I really did like the stony fresh ones as well and I'm sad that they're kind of fake so yeah see you guys later bye [Music]", "nGmzI-9S1GI": "how many milligrams do you eat bro the helmet what's up stoners cubans here and on today's video we are going to try some florida edibles edibles are a little bit newer in florida they've only been selling them for about the last year maybe a little less coffee's ready [Music] it's not even the best way to use tincture i'm just having fun oh there it is yeah i see it all just becomes one big drop at the end if you just let it sit and i'm gonna hit this while you hit that like and subscribe button and turn on notifications for future videos every time i pack a dry pipe i put way too much weed in it and i feel like i have to smoke the whole thing let's go [Music] oh yeah ice water from the dry pipe let's do it so here's some of the edibles that we actually got it's mostly like a hundred milligrams for the whole bar or bag of gummies or pack of cookies so they end up being about 10 milligrams per piece i think all of them except these nano gummies here those are like five milligrams per piece but i had 20 gummies in it and then you can see i've got some capsules here these are 50 milligrams so one of these equals five of any of the other pieces essentially that's why capsules are my favorite edible i'd rather just take a bunch of thc and then eat whatever i want later how do you think gordon ramsay would rate my plating do we kill it so like i said the capsules are my favorite because most of the edibles i got are like 100 milligrams for the whole candy bar the whole pack of gummies but two of these is 100 milligrams so this is most edibles right here so capsules are my preferred way to take it i'd rather get high and then eat cookies and brownies and not try to get high from eating the cookies and brownies i don't know high enough from edibles is usually i'm going to sleep i don't love edibles they don't hate everybody the same way like i mentioned 100 milligrams isn't gonna do the same to everybody a thousand isn't gonna do the same to everybody i've eaten as much as two thousand milligrams i have an edible mukbang video on my channel it's a pretty good brownie it's like little brownie bites little cookie bites that's pretty good it's kind of crispy i think i'm going to get a bunch of these and fill them up and eat them like like the cookie crisp cereal i'll be dope so nothing too it's just a lot of eating i mean i like eating but but damn this is expensive food they have a few of the better brands that are in other other states i got some wanna here i've had these in colorado like some of the better gummies in colorado the chocolate's really good see i'd rather eat this still only 100 milligrams for a whole candy bar sometimes i can eat a couple hundred milligrams of edibles and not really feel it so so being a couple pieces of chocolate a piece of brownie a piece of cookie that's only 40 milligrams and these are 50 each so let's do another 100 right here oh yeah see that's a good one i think i want to continue this outside so let's go over there all right let's see these wanna gummies are as good as i remember they have a good flavor but they're like they're kind of spongy i don't know how to explain it i said the consistency is a little different than a typical gummy but i like it i'll show you some nano gummies i think these ones are sugar-free okay not bad some people prefer to be able to taste the edibles when they're eating some people do not want to taste the edibles what do you guys think drop a comment let me know do you prefer to be able to taste a little bit of wheat in there do you not like it at all i mean tasting i guess reminds you eating an edible but you should already know what you're eating it's not great on flavor but it's it's medical marijuana it's medicine it doesn't need to taste amazing but it helps i don't know if these are the true gels or the vince ones but let's eat these pineapple ones from truly see these ones are really good but the consistency though a lot stickier than the other ones they're not as chewy as the other ones they're more like just like really sticky so i kind of get all in your mouth as my grandpa would say but i don't know where we're at on milligrams but i'm going to take another 100 i think this will put me at at least 300 maybe we're at close to four with all the pieces we've eaten all right we're almost at 400 milligrams let's see if we can get the 420 just like i don't want to eat all this right now i had some chinese food earlier today some fried rice you know i'm just gonna chew on all the gummies together gotta [Music] not gross but no they're gross i'm just gonna be chewing forever and that's how edibles work for me i have no idea how many milligrams i've eaten but i'm not worried at all because it's not going to be enough it's not good i said the three flavors of gummies were all battling it out of my mouth but that caroleep nano got me a [ __ ] one am i gonna eat this whole plate [Music] i guess um see the chocolate bar topped here chocolate bars are always primo it makes me wonder are chocolate bars the easiest thing to make like like we just take weed out of the equation and we're making stuff what's easier to make cookies brownies gummies chocolate bars i'm thinking with the chocolate bar they just melt chocolate mix the weed in it and then they just they get it cold in the shape my mom just told me we just spoke for like 10 minutes on the phone i forgot what i was doing um what was i saying guys somebody could somebody help me what was i saying i think we were just finishing these edibles i think i was trying i think chocolate bars are probably the easiest to make i feel like anywhere i've been to get edibles the chocolate bars always taste the best right my mama [ __ ] they're just like cookies and brownies we're both dry oh man that's a lot of edibles let's give me any more [ __ ] get another 100 down there we go here we go i think the wanna gummies my favorite although the truly ones are pretty close second they're just like different consistencies of gummy i think i'm more in the mood for the wanna ones now um if they all fit together there's only [Music] one how many milligrams do you eat bro we went for a nice long walk earlier but i might do another one i mean just look at him would you just look at him [Music] did you just look [Music] i feel so safe there's a kitty in here should we smoke a song before the doubles are kicking [Music] all right we're still waiting one thing about edibles i don't like i like taking a [ __ ] fatty bong rip and then my high is just like i'm like as high as i'm gonna be almost right after sometimes you know i'm gonna kind of take this off from there and like i said for me like edibles sometimes hit or miss sometimes i i'll eat a few hundred milligrams and just not feel it there's definitely a fun thing about edibles i couldn't do edibles every day i wouldn't enjoy wheat as much i don't think if i could only do edibles i mean maybe i'd figure it out but for me it's like either i think i didn't get high from it or i'm like i know i'm high from it and i'm just really sleepy i do like a 2 000 milligram edible mustang in one of my videos but i've got higher from other things when i smoked an eighth of weed in nine minutes i got higher than when i ate two grams of thc edibles basically and i think about this sometimes they ate the wheat has way less thc than 2 000 milligrams so it's like i've got higher from smoking flour than i have from eating edibles now mind you the edibles do last longer it is a different kind of powder but i'm just talking about me in my head sitting there and going oh you're high maybe i'm higher than i think i am i've been rambling sitting in this position for four minutes and i have no idea why so maybe i'm higher than i think i am maybe that's what it is maybe edibles hit like an hour ago you know i'm just like higher than i think i have also i did just rip that bomb and that's a good question man and like tinctures i mean this isn't really inedible but it's still in the i'm not smoking category so this is pretty good for some people i think i like this better than edibles but even more so than this i like a tac drink you get something that's really nicely infused and you just drink it it takes effect so much quicker than an edible i eat snacks and junk food all the time but i mostly drink water so when i reward myself with like a juice drink that has thc in it it's like out of the ordinary from what i normally drink and then also it gets me hot so kind of like a cold thing i don't know i'm not kind of on my pump that's not what it's a walmart how long are we i don't know it doesn't say on this i was just like is it 10 seconds is it a minute i can't even remember it doesn't matter [Music] the squares on that break apart easier than any candy bar i don't know how to tell you anytime i've ever tried to snap a hershey's it like snaps crooked right through the middle of one of me bro it's segmented how's this happening this is about amount perfectly there's so much chocolate how you [ __ ] up chocolate you're dome oh i kind of did a thing i mean it's just not as bright it still exists but let's get high about it [Music] oh these are just some of my uh adult gummies they have a medicine in them you wouldn't like them you wouldn't be interested how many milligrams [Music] like 10 each uh what they're not for you they're not for you because they're too weak damn [ __ ] kids man well if

is it Betty oh I see what your radar the review huh this is a review for the 400 milligram officially medicated wax bacon so is : everybody so this is a review for waxey's medicated bacon these are 400 milligram as you can see by the original picture one is missing there is a host half of it was eaten in alive the link for the live will be in the description if you want to see more about it you know eating all that kind of stuff but let me tell you how it worked out for me and let me explain about the product so I got to spread through my dispensary there this is $20 so listen so it basically comes sealed in this package there's really not anything to it as far as information goes you know tell you milligrams they don't tell you what the actual strain is that you're using or none of the other stuff so that's my only that's one of my first things off of that right now I didn't really light any like care for you can see there's really nothing on the back and then I said it again this is a this could be slow I don't know it could be salesman samples or stuff to get out the product out I don't know they might have a better finished product down the road I'm not sure I've been anyways so let's just talk about medicinal why's this wolf first of all well you know Bacon's really good when homeboy is just chilling here hoping that some of it just spills but there's no way on earth that can give them any so there and then old sniffing EEMA significant around can't get a guy sniffing it look what's going on buddy so I'm surrounded now by people that think this bacon is delicious so obviously it smells like bacon and the dogs would happily have no problem eating it but I can tell you the human it's absolutely delicious it's very it's not crispy it is very very oily probably they sprayed it or with the Sun probably sprayed it I'm not sure most companies spray they don't really cook it with that but maybe you put it in there I'm gonna pull it out because it get my fingers all oily but you could see nice thick piece of bacon I believe it's a little bit undercooked so it'll be a nice piece because I could taste it I could taste that it was a little bit not that super wasn't cooked cooked but anyways a still a taste of delicious absolutely zero group 0 cannabis taste great product I got [ __ ] up off just half of it so this is one of those things where you might want to be a little bit of a little bit my girl hope she had a little chunk of it and she slept like a baby so do you want to have a good time or you need this for some like glue chunks of

loss i feel high though you hot [ __ ] i'm dizzy as hell no it's that shirt i believe you alone i'm dizzy all right well it was just a regular cookie so whatever you think not true", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "XZ6xqWJV7tQ": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at an edible this time sour infused gushers uh 500 milligrams now this is obviously a black market edible i guess you could say uh and there's probably a thousand different uh edible gushers but these specific ones let's let's just take a peek inside very melty and gooey as you can see but delicious may i say and very potent but obviously anybody could really anybody could buy these packaging and fill them up with uh edible infused gushers oh by the way these are the world's dankest gushers oh not even worlds worlds wow just well medicated fruit snacks if we take a look at the back a sour burst of flavor in every bite uh gluten free yeah i'm sure uh there's a government warning which probably just doesn't matter that much on these now if you if you uh if you pick these up make sure you trust the person you are going to and make sure you're not paying any expensive amount of money at all these these are like the mids of edibles like you i would not pay more than 15 for this single package right here just because there's so many better options and more reliable options and more legit options without typos and extreme claims but hey if you if this is your only option uh i've had much worse and i'm sure i'm sure you can like i'm sure all that stuff is thc infused also all the [ __ ] around the bag so i mean if you trust if if you see some random dude with these i would definitely stay away don't even take the chance don't even bother but if it's from a reliable source maybe slightly there you can expect slightly more but not by much you can get these packaging like you can just get you can just buy the packaging for like 90 cents a pop and just fill them with you know actual fruit gushers if you really if it if you really felt so inclined to do that so i would definitely be careful around these um i don't i don't want to recommend them just just because how easily they can be just absolutely fake um i'd say i got lucky but yeah there's there's a thousand different uh edible gushers just don't don't get this one just just wait around just wait just go to it go to a dispensary if you're uh if you really want them there's also uh infused cashews that comes in cans kind of like the warheads cubes that i reviewed a few months ago and i would trust those ten times more than i would trust these so stay away be careful make sure you trust who you are going to if it's not a dispensary and uh yeah later", "XsWTWZ2iSUs": "I found out probably a couple two or three weeks ago that I'm going to have to go gluten free and it's it's a new experience I've been using the internet to do a lot of research i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and medications the doctors were given me we're not working so i decided to change my diet and a gluten-free diet seemed to help a great deal today one in 133 Americans has an allergy to gluten but what is gluten and what foods have it gluten is the protein that's found in wheat barley rye as its main where it mainly comes from now it's also contaminated though and oats it also is anything that's made with those products an allergy to gluten also known as celiac disease can affect the body's ability to process nutrients it causes the micro velai the little fingers that stick

eating habits local residents suffering from gluten allergies have one important tip for anybody who's looking to go gluten free it's important to read your labels and to look for gluten free learning to read labels that's what I'm having to do I try to tell everybody don't run into to read the label because you never know what you're what you're ingesting you'd be surprised what you're ingesting

suddenly run out of them because let's face it these little guys they smell great they taste great but this next story puts their yummy goodness in a new light there are already plenty of health reasons not to overindulge in the sweet stuff and when you say actually that leaf do you mean like he didn't know they were yeah he seemed alert he's alert Very Berry in Paris the paramedics arrived and the accidental stoner eventually slept it off but I'm guessing next time they'll make sure that only the brownies get baked I love this story because there's a 53 year old dad who apparently found four brownies in the backseat of his car that his adult children had used earlier in the day and he saw we've all been there you see one and you can't stop at one so we eat all four pot brownies having no idea that they were spiked with with cannabis and I guess he was crawling around on the floor randomly cursing calling the family cat a [ __ ] I've heard of personally people OD'ing a little on pot is when they've ingested it well I think that's because when you cook pot into brownies you actually use an oil you're not using the flour that people smoke and it's much more potent this was a big issue initially at least in a state like Colorado that legalized marijuana because the edibles and they were coming showing up in candies cookies and very quickly people were overdosing and freaking out because it's just people may be used to smoking and getting a certain dosage and with these you just don't really know and the delayed effect because when you smoke something it very quickly gets in your bloodstream first pass metabolism when you eat something it takes longer so it may be thirty minutes to an hour so a lot of people will they'll know they're eating marijuana but again if you do ingest edibles make sure that you do not just leave them laying around because this can be truly dangerous not only for adults but certainly for young children we'll be right back you", "UgkDQbkfgTE": "all right yada though what's problem with it you already know what it is welcome back to my channel i'm here and i just pulled these out and my homie bobby right here just said what are these blunt wraps no bro they're not blunt wraps they're edibles oh they are yeah edibles watch i'm gonna show you bobby look this is bobby dude how dare you think these are blunt wraps i'm about to eat all these you can try some if you want to look like [ __ ] dude all right so look dude we're at work it's all good so look we got some cotton candy ones try these ones and then i already got these are from plume and i think we'll just smack some real quick while i'm at work these are the blueberry and then i got some of the watermelon ones show them what you're eating cotton candy delicious cotton candy i like that this one's like a sour um like a sour belt i don't want sour though for cotton candy though it tastes like hot candy right now a little bit what's this good blueberry blueberry i think i like the blueberry nice watermelon sour belt the blueberry i got some peach ones at the house piece one of the five these are 30 milligrams each so that's 90 milligrams usually or that will be the watermelon's fire though um and what's this the one that you just now ate mm-hmm watermelon the one i've got but that one's fire you can have another blueberry i'm good i'm good for now [Music] okay well i got to eat a little bit more though another watermelon because the watermelon was fire two more so 90 plus 60 that's 150 milligrams so i'm gonna get a little higher while i'm at work", "Z2XicujPMGw": "now it's not that I think the coronavirus is something that you need to stockpile food for is if it's some type of an emergency but you want to leave the house as little as possible and in order to do that you want to have foods that support your health now my neighborhood I go to about three stores that I know have healthy organic foods and we'll start with Trader Joe's run inside so to start with we have nuts and I buy the typical ones here pistachios cashews walnuts they usually have organic ones and those are great for your brain and I usually skip the almonds because I buy almond butter I prefer raw and organic when I could get them at the specialty market but they haven't been in so I'll get the raw almond butter here and another nut that I'll get on Amazon is Brazil nuts because they're full of antioxidants vitamins and minerals particularly selenium not a big fan of commercial nut milks because there's a lot of ingredients that are unnecessary and unhealthy but Trader Joe's isn't the worst I've seen I prefer to just buy the nuts including coconuts and making them myself and you could see my videos on that we have coconut milk almond milk and hemp milk all super easy to make as far as soups I try to avoid getting anything in two cans so they make a few I like in containers that are organic like lentils and split pea the organic butternut squash has more sugar than I like but it's pretty good and they have a great organic vegetable broth and I'll add a few different things to that including quinoa which is really a staple in my diet I have that just about every day for the breakfast or lunch sprouted with a few other things like salad or whatever else I'm eating I also avoid typical pasta so I like a quinoa pasta and Trader Joe's isn't bad it's got more brown rice than I like that's known to be high in arsenic but it's not bad and you can see my recipe for how to make a tempeh and vegetable pasta with a quinoa pasta and with the quinoa pasta I'll add this red lentil pasta because it's organic and it's the only ingredient I'll tell you though the taste isn't create so I'll add about 5 to 10 percent of these into the quinoa pasta just to mix up proteins the only oats I would mess with is organic steel-cut oats and I'll soak these overnight before cooking up but they'll last in the container forever as well I like these kale no key that trader Joe has the ingredients are pretty clean and you can freeze them for a while same with their cauliflower no key these are both best done on a pan with coconut oil the cauliflower seems to bunch up sometimes but it's good if you haven't tried it while we're in the frozen section I love these organic berries and I'll get the blueberries and raspberries and Trader Joe's has the best organic acai I've seen because it has no sweeteners and no other ingredients in it unlike all of the rest of the ones that I found if you eat fish the only ones that I would get is wild Alaskan salmon and I like frozen just as much as fresh or more and wild caught sardines in water with bones all other fish are heavily contaminated from our polluted oceans so I would avoid them especially tuna if you're eating beef Trader Joe's has an organic 100% grass-fed ground beef that's frozen and a free-range organic chicken as well if you're gonna get more meat than either of those things I'll have links below for delivery services that are organic and pasture raised now as far as their vegetable section I'm not crazy about it because everything comes in a plastic bag so I get most of my stuff at a specialty market down the block and we'll get to that next but organic celery will last you awhile as well as organic cauliflower and cauliflower is really a staple dish for me I make a roasted cauliflower with herbs and spices as well as broccoli also a cauliflower soup a cauliflower rice risotto a cauliflower fried rice with herbs and a cauliflower mashed and you could see links for all those videos below now this is the best non-dairy cheese I've ever had it's an almond mozzarella and I almost never like non-dairy cheeses and I make a pizza with that I also like nutritional yeast and if you haven't tried this it's a great spice and I add that to salads and soups and some other things I like Trader Joe's organic olive oil because it comes in a dark glass bottle and it's not on the list of the many that have been proven to be fake onions or garlic are great to eat right now as well I don't typically eat a lot of onions in garlic because I use them as an herb because they're known to kill viruses and bacteria but now might be a good time to use them as I was saying I skipped a salad section here because even though it's organic everything comes in plastic bags and I really like to avoid that i buy all those in the next door here and we'll start with beets and you can eat the leaves as well and these are super healthy for you I usually cut the beets in quarters and eat a quarter with every salad I have those will last for weeks same with carrots and my favorite is purple cabbage because it's super high in antioxidants and vitamin C but most importantly I make a lacto-fermented sauerkraut with this that is out of this world and super healthy for you it's very easy to make and you can get more good bacteria in one serving of this then you can in a whole bottle of probiotics next is bananas now you can't refrigerate these but you can freeze them and I'll use these in smoothies as well as pancakes that I make and I'll make an ice cream with it that I often eat with almond butter next we have sweet potatoes and I'll make a sweet potato mash with that with herbs very quick and easy for you to make and other things that will last long as pumpkin and butternut squash those are very simple you just cut them in half put them facedown on a pan and bake them for about 45 minutes to an hour at 400 degrees Fahrenheit lemons are great right now because they'll last for a while and they're great with detox and helping you to cough up mucus if you're sick apples and pears will also last you a while and avocado is one of my favorites and you can freeze these as well by taking them out of the shell and putting them in a container now if you want to avoid canned beans like me the bulk section is perfect for this I have about five or six beans that I put in a rotation each week and I soak and sprout them because that takes out the anti nutrients like phytic acid and leptons and you can see my video on how and why it's important to do that link below as well as all the other recipes I mentioned and I especially like chickpeas because I make hummus with this and I use the organic tahini from Trader Joe's with that as well hummus is also surprisingly easy to make and my recipe for that will also be linked below now as far as snacks I'll get a raw cacao from Amazon and make a healthy chocolate and I also get organic dates and make date balls with them and these are a great replacement to brownies that are really addictive and healthy for you another snack that I got on Amazon is an organic heirloom popcorn and I make that with turmeric and rosemary and other herbs and I have a video for that below as well I also get Redmond real soul from Amazon a hemp protein powder a whey protein powder and I'm very particular about my protein powders I never get isolates and never get ones with other ingredients in them psyllium husk fiber is also a must and I get the whole husk and I put that in smoothies and other important videos to watch right now on my turmeric and ginger tea and in ancient tonic that I make with many different herbs that's great for killing gram positive and negative bacteria and it's said to kill viruses as well but I couldn't possibly guess or say that it would kill the corona virus but it's an extra measure you can take against it so I hope that was helpful for you and I'll have links below for quick and easy healthy recipes make on a daily basis better like staple foods for me so for more videos on health and wellness related to my body and

carb treats now those of you in the gym are may have seen me post about the kodiak cakes my favorite pancake flapjack mix this is all whole grains they have both an instant version with whole wheat oat and honey and you just add water to and mix and they also have the mix that tree and egg in milk too which gives you about 13 grams of protein per serving now the difference here is that we're talking about whole grains slow digesting low glycemic carbohydrates which is what you want to focus on and most of your meals now compare that to something like a Bisquick you know the flour and Bisquick is standard enriched bleached wheat flour which is a high glycemic fast digesting carbohydrate so obviously most people would immediately look for the Kodiak cakes as their whole-grain source because most of the time you want those low glycemic slow digesting carbohydrates however however if you're gonna have a pancake meal as your post-workout carb source then there's nothing wrong with using a straight up Bisquick mix because you want to go for those fast digesting carbs along with some syrup as well as your post-workout recovery however the rest of the time of the day if it's not a post-workout meal I will go for the Kodiak cakes whole-grain slow digestion now one thing I will mention is I'm not a I'm not a huge protein pancake kind of guy if you go to the gym army page you'll see a lot of recipes on adding pro gym to your pancake mix for high protein pancakes I just prefer I've made pro gym as delicious as can be to dress so I actually prefer to drink it but you can mix in like I said if you go to the gym army page and Facebook you can find a lot of recipes from other gym army members on making high protein pancakes with pro gym but personally I just make straight of Pancakes and drink my projym by itself and actually a perfect meal with the pancakes for me would be three whole eggs pancakes and then a pro gym shake to top it off so enjoy sherry Jim I remember share your high protein pancake recipes on the gym army page and guys stay Jim army strong", "pro0AhX6NnY": "as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not

amazing like every other day in today's video we're gonna be doing something that i have never ever done in my whole entire life and that's eating 500 milligrams of thc so i'll be eating these wonky cups there's 250 milligrams per cup there's two cups inside of this packaging which is basically like reese's cups with can of butter inside of it if we just look at the package the packaging of it is very very beautiful looks very very appetizing on top of that today i'm gonna go get my hair done like i'm gonna get it braided i'm gonna get a fade right so i'm gonna be either extra fried while all of that is going on or i'll just be feeling normal as [ __ ] i also got a timer going up so every 30 minutes approximately i'll be giving you guys a little update telling you guys how i'm feeling right now all that good stuff related to eating 500 milligrams so i want you guys to drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below check out the new discord server that i made just for you guys and without further ado let's eat these wonky cups alright guys i really really can't wait to open up these wonky cups and i just want to tell you guys that i didn't smoke before this so i am like basically 100 sober and i want to give you guys the 100 experience of what it's like taking 500 milligrams and now without further ado the thing that everybody's been waiting for let's open up these wonky cups all right i came back with a glass of water just so i can like properly digest this i'm going to open this bad boy up how do you open this this was my guess i knew it wasn't gonna be a reese's cup i knew it was gonna be like a piece of chocolate i really knew like i knew they couldn't give us a regular cup it had to be a chocolate so this is the first one let's take a bite out of it hmm really does taste like a reese's cup i will be starting the timer over here you know what i'm saying so it's been about four seconds give or take you know we're not gonna you know get angry for like 30 seconds right so i'll completely finish this one they really really did a good job this really tastes like the regular old thing it just doesn't have the same shape we got the other one as you can see they are pretty chunky right they do feel chunkier and bigger than a regular reese's puff but let's take another bite off of this one cheers taste as [ __ ] just amazing oh wow i feel as if i'm gonna struggle on the eating part more than the actual high all right let's get it i just hate peanut butter inside of that chocolate i'm really forcing myself to eat this it's like some people that don't like olives and they're like forced to eat it for science like my blood insulin levels just spike at this point it's been five minutes since i ate the first one really five minutes is a very negligible time so i'm gonna check back in about 25 minutes to 30 minutes and tell you guys how i feel obviously for those who don't know it takes about two hours for the effects to completely settle in give or take some people it takes three hours some people it takes an hour you know what i mean but for me generally takes about two hours two hours and a half if in like four hours i actually do not feel [ __ ] or like it just feels light it's either a i have to go on the tolerance break or b i'm just gonna spark up a fat ass blunt but we will see by then i am praying that this [ __ ] just gets me slumped on the couch or on the chair and yeah guys i'll check back in about 30 minutes all right we are 32 minutes in and i'm starting to feel a little bit of effects right it kind of feels like i just took a little bong grip you know a 0.2 gram or maybe i took a little hit off a wax pen in class that's the type of feeling i'm feeling right now generally you don't really feel the effects in just 30 minutes so i'll check back with you guys in another 30 minutes giving us an hour total [Music] we are about one hour and ten minutes in and i feel as if the effects kind of went away it's very weird to say like honestly it's it's just a little weird so like as of right now the effects have not really changed there isn't much difference besides the way i'm seeing things it's like there's this huge freaking like no actually you know what the effects have kind of increased i would be actually a liar to say that as i'm trying to speak right now i'm having a little bit of a hard time like knowing what to say it's just my thoughts are not popping up it's like i'm going blank every few seconds so as it's starting to slowly slowly creep up i can sense that this is going to be a heavy body buzz but overall up until now i still haven't felt the full effect so i'll catch you guys in another 30 minutes oh [ __ ] yo i was checking out mr thc's live right about now but damn god damn no cap the lab just ended it's been about an hour 46 minutes since i first ate approximately the first one give or take and hmm i'm starting to feel it my mans i'm starting to really really feel it it's kicking in it's like it's coming perfectly the feeling right about now is kinda like you know smoking a nice fat wood you know like that type of feeling right about now so for some that might be a lot for others and it might be just okay but really it just got me relaxed i'm fried i know my eyes are probably so like very very small right now like they're probably very very small i'm starting to see that i've gotten a little bit slower but yeah let's see in 30 minutes also in 30 minutes it's gonna be two hours and 15 minutes in i think it's gonna start kicking in more so i'll catch you guys in 30 minutes let's get it uh it's been 2 hours and 30 minutes landlord is leaving that's good for us we can now freely express ourselves in our true ways without arousing too many suspicions i am fried i have the pasties i'm having a hard time doing basic [ __ ] that i've done at least over a hundred times considering that i have over 100 videos like i was [ __ ] up you know did i save the file did i not save the file i was just going off my mind just focuses one second and then unfocuses goes blank and goes back

[Music] holy [Music] all right i'm on the couch i just popped here and now looking at myself with better lighting i do look extra fried a few moments later six and a half hours later oh man god damn i don't know if y'all can see the damn time but it is 10 42 that is like approximately nine hours since i actually took the first edible and i woke up from i guess a cush coma that [ __ ] was just insane guys like i went to get my hair done as you can see i got my braid up i didn't get the lineup nor the fade yeah i'm gonna go do that tomorrow at 10 a.m but yeah i went to do this and i was just

dose chocolate marijuana brownies and hop up the THC with two layers of cannabis infused chocolate heaven the main brownie is loaded with cannabutter and the icing is also infused with cannabis coconut oil but you could also use butter in that layer too either way these double dose brownies are guaranteed to be a kick in the pants this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling vaporizers wax pans rolling papers and accessories from raw and much more at great prices save 10% on everything all the time with the code canna basics and roughhouse studios.com now here's what you need to make the brownies but be sure to note that the icing ingredients are towards the end of the video you need 1/2 a cup of cannabutter a cup of white sugar 2 eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder now unless you already have some kind of either made the first step is going to be to make your cannabutter you can definitely use pre bought or store-bought cannabutter for this but we're gonna make our own there'll also be a link in the description and at the end of the video to see how we made this water method of making cannabutter but the first step is going to be to manicure your cannabis make sure that you break it up take out any stems and seeds and then decarboxylate activate it an oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes while that's baking you want to also clarify your butter clarifying your butter it means that you're removing all of the milk solids so that you have a nice yellow pure clear butter oil this will make it more bioavailable it'll also help make the infusion more strong when you infuse the marijuana after your marijuana has decarboxylated it's gonna be lightly toasted brown and we're going to combine that with the butter and then we're also going to combine some water an equal part of butter and water that's one cup of each and then we're also going to add in the cannabis and that's about a 1/2 ounce of of cannabis there and you can definitely vary the amount of cannabis depending on the potency that you want and if you make this amount of cannabis butter you'll have more than enough to do the recipe that we're making today and you'll also have about a quarter cup left over and you can also do like we're doing it combined and you were using part coconut oil and we're also using part of this infused butter but now you got going to strain out your after you've infused for at least two hours over a double boiler you're going to strain out the cannabis and then to separate the water from the butter you could put that in refrigerator for a couple hours and let the water settle to the bottom and then the butter reforms at the top and then you have a nice very good flavored a little bit lighter colored sometimes than other cat about is because you can see the rust colored waters left over there but that's taking away some of the bitter flavor and chlorophyll and impurities away so you have a very clean and a pure butter that's left over its gonna taste delicious and our brownies okay so now we're going to move on to making the brownies [Music] okay we'll begin our brownies by first putting our half a cup of Canada butter over a medium saucepan bringing that up until it's melted and just before it starts to get too hot and start to brown so you want it hot but not not starting to smoke or anything like that so make sure you don't brown the butter and then after it's hot throw it put it in a a dish like a pyrex dish here and then add in your cup of sugar we're good doing this to help melt the sugar and also to cool off the butter so that when we add our egg and next it won't cook our egg so then add in your eggs one at a time and mix those in and then we're also going to add in the vanilla extract it's one teaspoon of vanilla extract again mixing it well and once we have our wet ingredients in there we're gonna now first add in our cocoa and once I add in the cocoa I want to go ahead and mix that in because cocoa can be really messy so I like to go ahead and get the cocoa mixed in before I had in the rest of the dry ingredients so I've got the cocoa mixed and now I'm adding in the flour all-purpose flour one cup I'm adding in a half a cup at a time so it mixed in the first half a cup and now I'm going to add in the second half a cup of flour but then I'm also going to add in the baking powder as well as the salt we're gonna continue mixing that until I have that oh very well incorporated it could take a couple of minutes and what's that well until it's nice and glossy and fully combined now we're going to go ahead and spray and flour my pan I've also lined it in foil that'll just help me pull the brownies out of the hand when I go to cut them but go ahead and oil and flour that generously or they may stick now we're gonna add in the brownie batter you can see the brownie batter is really thick and dark and there's gonna be some really good fudgy brownies so I've got that I'll pour it in the pan I've hit the pan once on the table and let it settle in there and now we're gonna bake the brownies these brownies bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes you want to sure you keep an eye on those you don't want them to get too Brown but you also want to make sure they get done and you can use a toothpick and stick it in the center if it comes out clean you know they're done [Music] and now while our brownies are cooking we're going ahead and combine all the ingredients for our frosting which is 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder a cup of powdered sugar 3 tablespoons of cannabutter or cannabis infused coconut oil a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of honey we're to combine all of those ingredients into a medium bowl and we'll be combining those all together and in this instance we're using a coconut oil that we already had made that's a really strong coconut oil we want these double those brownies to be really potent so we're using this really extra strong coconut oil but you could also use the same butter that you used in the first half of the recipe you could use that butter or any kind of cannabis infused butter or coconut oil for this part of the recipe and then we've combined all our ingredients here and now we're going to use a spatula or metal spoon and make that combined together into our frosting and ours was really dry so I added in actually some of the butter I ended up adding some of that in as well too to wet it some so that it was the consistency of her frosting it was still a little bit thick but that's ok because we're gonna frost these while the brownies are still hot so we're gonna let the heat of the brownies kind of help melt this fudgy icing it which is more kind of another layer of brownies than it is actually in icing but it just really is delicious and it really adds to the potency especially if you use a really strong oil for this top layer but what you're using is you're letting the heat of the brownies that have come out of the oven they're completely done but they're still warm and we're spreading this fudgy icing over the top of it and we're letting the heat of the brownies kind of melt that icing so that it forms a nice sort of dense layer of fudge on top of these brownies and once that's cooled off you're gonna be able to especially if you use the foil just lift it right up out of the pan and cut these I cut these into 12 sections so that would be at 12 servings but it's up to you to cut them have any slices that you want they're kind of small brownies in this case but these are really rich they're almost almost like a piece of fudge they're very very rich and they're also very strong so the 12 slices was perfect and take a look at those dark and dense and I tell you these are some dank and strong brownies one of these is enough for a serving two of them will really kind of get your mind blown if you use a strong infusion like we did here they're very moist and I used a really high-quality cocoa so they have a real rich dark chocolaty

review today we got a product here this is called the rainbow delights this is from tribal delights you got ahead of you today tell you what the ingredients is here this is says gelatin real fruit juice pure honey flavored gelatin tart and sour not sure why they put tart in this hour in this but 600 milligrams THC yeah I believe the is there 25 show you guys 600 milligrams of THC so it's colleague a nice little pot leaf going on there nice design you can see two colors so they layered it when they made it smell like it smells kind of fruity little dude fruity notes a little bit of tartness not really getting hints of weed maybe slightly I think we should eat this whole thing cuz you know y'all know it's really tough thick gummy I miss in the fridge chewy you know I really taste like weed oh yeah like yeah oh it's really tough gummy it's good no hi even sure if I should eat this all day man but why not my dear no probably won't I like my THC I assume it'll have me heavily medicated yeah more than half really tastes like we stronger my mom like almost like I don't enjoy the flavor of it they should make this with distillate I don't know what they're thinking I wouldn't taste like it wouldn't taste like we strong we'd flavor but you know it tastes like weed cuz this this is 600 milligrams so if you're making it with a platic plant extraction a full plant extraction like this like what it tastes like yeah it's gonna taste like strong like wheat if you got a lot in there like soo ceremonies jacimo alright that would make these with distillate in my opinion then they wouldn't taste like weed at all you can throw a leg up you know like a thousand milligrams a distillate in there THC desolate you know I wouldn't taste like we did all your I want done this gummy man true you know you taste the fruit juice is lovely guy kinda like a fruit punchy kind of flavor on top looks like don't you taste like a little bit I'm not sure at the bottom flavor is or even in top 100 you know if they're top ones differently we're all could just be food tribal delights 600 milligram edible rainbow delights baby we almost got it the whole thing ingested all right I don't know if I can really taste the wheat taste too much now that it's like completely coated my mouth it doesn't take I can taste more than the fruit juice flavors and a little tartness last bite well that's it alrighty so we're gonna come back in two hours and yeah tell you guys how I'm feeling see you then hey we're back here it's been like 45 minutes I'm feeling pretty medicated so far but we haven't had that to our right these are an empty stomach so that's probably why I keep doing all quicker in there gummy - I just feel through my eyeballs it's a yeah I just me to keep my eyes normal I said we'll come back here in an hour yeah we're back here spend two hours now I'm pretty good huh medicated mm-hmm 600 milligrams dudes me good man oh yeah [Music] yeah ten out of ten like on how you feel other than they can be made with distillate then they wouldn't taste like weed that's all well yeah yeah good one everybody she gonna say a little thumbs up if you liked it subscribe share to anybody else thinking like it he's helped", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "VvJm4pQZ04s": "- [Claire] We always say this, I know, but these are actually the best brownies you're ever going to have. They're gooey, they're\nchocolatey, they're fudgy. Oh, they live up to every expectation you think a brownie should be. (lively music) We took all the tips and the\ntricks from the internet, from our old gramma's recipes, from places we'd worked, to find the best recipe that we could. Throw out every other recipe\nthat you have for brownies. This is the one you will use going forward for the rest of your life. (lively music) I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but beep beep, you know. (lively music) All right, guys, as always, prep your tin. You know what to do, butter and parchment. So the first cooking job\nthat I ever had was working for a pastry chef and he made\nthese incredible brownies. When you start working in kitchens, they always say write down the recipes 'cause you're gonna forget them later. And of course, I did not do that, but there are a few things that I remember from his recipe that I really wanted to incorporate into our brownie recipe. Obviously, good brownies\nneed good chocolate, and the chocolate bar you\nwanna use is dealer's choice. You can go for something really mellow like a milk chocolate bar\nor go into something really, really dark, like an 80% dark chocolate would work really well in here. We're gonna double up on\nthe chocolate so we're gonna use cocoa powder as well. Because we wanted a really\nrich, dark flavor and color, we went with the dutch processed. You can use regular cocoa powder here, but we're always looking\nfor that intense flavor, that intense color. The one on the left used\nregular cocoa powder. It's kind of drier on\ntop and almost too dense and fudgy on the bottom. We're adding a little\nbit of cocoa powder here. We're gonna add even more later. Espresso powder just\ndoes a really great job of enhancing any chocolate\nflavor in a recipe. If you're worried about the caffeine, you can get a decaf powder as well. It's not gonna taste\nlike coffee or espresso, it's really just another flavor enhancer. When we add the hot, melted\nbutter to the chocolate, cocoa powder and espresso powder, it's gonna help melt\neverything down and dissolve, which is gonna help keep our brownies really fudgy later on. (lively music) Sugars, we have granulated\nsugar, and then when deciding between light brown and dark brown, the real difference\nhere is that dark brown has more molasses, ergo more flavor. I don't even know what ergo means. Again, just wanted to knock your socks off with the flavor here and dark brown was the right one for the job. And we're also gonna add a bit of salt as it brings out the\nflavor in any baked good. (lively music) So we're gonna have six eggs. Always crack your eggs\ninto a separate bowl in case you get any shell. Best way to remedy that\nis to use the egg shell. It breaks the surface tension\nand is the easiest way to get eggshell out of your eggs. You can start by adding\none egg to the sugar just so you don't make a huge mess. Once you get it going though,\nyou can add the rest of 'em, no big deal. You don't have to be super\ncareful like you would for a cake for instance. So working for that pastry chef, one thing that he did with\nhis brownies is he would beat the living crap out of the\neggs and sugar and really, really incorporate tons of air, so much so that it would look like a super thick pancake batter almost. This is what happens when you\ndon't beat the sugar and eggs, kind of just falls really flat, right. The great thing about beating\nthe eggs and the sugar is you create a really solid foundation and you don't have to\nuse a chemical leavener. Then you're gonna pour\nin that beautiful ganache that we made. Oh my God. Actually, when we were shooting this, there is a crowd of\npeople around us 'cause we couldn't get over how\ninsanely delicious this looked. Oh God, I just, I can't\nbelieved we baked these. Honestly, I could've just\neaten the batter myself. (lively music) I'm really upset that America can't get on the metric system, but like fine. If we're gonna use cups,\nalways scoop and level, to make sure we have the\nright amount of flour. If you just take the cup\nstraight into the flour, it's gonna be denser\nthan you need it to be. And you're going to sift the\nflour and the cocoa powder into the mixture to make\nsure we have no lumps and just make sure that we're really quickly incorporating it\ninto the rest of the batter. (lively music) And fold. Because we beat all that\nair in with the eggs, we don't wanna totally deflate that, so just get the dry\ningredients incorporated as quickly as you can. (lively music) Pour the completed batter\ninto your prepped tin, smooth it out to make sure\neverything's pretty level. (lively music) And into the oven it goes. So these are gonna rise quite a bit. After about 20 minutes,\nwe're gonna take them out. This is my favorite tip\nof the whole recipe. Take the brownies out and slam\nthem on your kitchen counter. It's gonna crack the top as\nwell as evens out everything and you get a much more\nconsistent texture. These are the same recipe. The one on the left is not\nwhacked, right whacked. At this point, we're also\ngoing to add a bit of sea salt, optional but highly recommended. Adds a little salty bite,\nsweet and salty, always good. With a lot of baked goods,\nyou'll stick a toothpick in and no batter remains, then you're good. It's kind of not the\ncase with these brownies. You will have a good amount\nof fudginess that comes out on the toothpick. Trust us, they've been in\nthere for like 45 minutes. They're definitely cooked through. They're just fudgy. When they do cool down, they\nalso will deflate quite a bit. It results in a really even\ntexture all throughout. Again, I can't say fudgy enough. I don't even like fudge,\nlittle known thing about me, but these brownies are insane. I need to cut these nice. They need to be a good, perfect square. It's so satisfying to see a perfectly cut batch of brownies, obviously. (lively music) Oh my gosh, a little tip too, is to clean your knife after each cut. You'll see a little bit of\nthat fudginess comes off. They're fudgy but they're not dense. (lively music) And that is it. I mean, look at that texture. Look at it! This is like your go to brownie batter. It's amazing as is, but you can also mix in\nanything that you want, more chocolate chunks,\npotato chips, pretzels. This is like a phenomenal\nstandard brownie recipe but feel free to go crazy\nand mix in whatever you want. Making brownies from scratch, you know, there's other options out\nthere that are easier, but it's one of those\nfundamental baked goods that doesn't take a ton of technique, but they also go with\neverything and every event. You know what I mean? Like you have a break up, brownies. Birthday, brownies. Like, they kind of work for anything. Just one of those feel good,\ncrowd pleasing deserts, that's just always a win. Okay, that's fine. I'm just gonna keep\ntalking and we're leave it and it's gonna be fine. - [Male] You're funny, Claire. - [Claire] (laughing) Stop. - [Male] You're so funny. - [Claire] You're so funny. - [Male] You're funny. - [Claire] Beep, beep. - [Male] You're slacking. - [Claire] I guess. (camera clicking)", "FcXaW6fekfc": "what's up guys welcome back today i'm gonna be showing you how to infuse chips this also works for any other kind of chips i just chose doritos because i feel like a lot of people like doritos the readers are gonna be a little bit easier because you're gonna have more surface area but this will work for um cereal it will work for pretzels it'll work for chips any type of like trail mixy type you know like grab and go little snack foods little bread type things i am going to be using infused oil or butter in this if you want to use tincture i do have a video that i'll put it below there's one for um hot cheetos and there's one for um cereal and they're both a similar concept but i also talk about tincture in there which is a little bit different but i feel like most people are using butter or oil which is why i'm going to use it for this one but i just wanted to do an updated video on it the reason why i'm using infused coconut oil instead of butter is because it's what i have on hand i have my butter in the freezer and i just didn't take it out so i'm like i'll just use the oil but the results are like for the effect is the same whether you use tincture oil or butter um the process is the same for butter or oil so if you're following on with exactly what i'm doing you can use butter or oil if you want to use tincture like i said check out one of the other videos it will taste better with butter because obviously everybody knows butter tastes delicious i'm going to be using coconut oil like i said because what i have on hand but you can use i recommend using butter over oil it really is just going to affect the taste it's not going to affect the result of the actual effects so i'm going to start by taking some of my oil i'm putting it in a little container i have a method on here and i am going to microwave it and yes i know a lot of you guys are going to have something to say about me microwaving it because it seems like you all hate when i microwave it but you guys don't have to microwave to each their own right you can melt it over a double boiler so feel free to do that i'm going to be using a microwave but by no means are you guys required to also use a microwave so please don't get mad at me for using a microwave we'll just set that aside i had already preheated my oven to 250 degrees you can do anywhere you can experiment between 200 and 250. i've had good results with all of those numbers in between um but i'm doing at 250 this time so i'm just going to start with um i have a pen with some parchment paper and i'm going to lay out my chips now if you're going to use chips that aren't doritos and have less of a large surface area you will put them into a bowl and shake them up but that causes some waste because when you shake it up there's oil and butter sticking to the sides of the bowl um or to the parchment paper etc so doritos are nice because of the large surface area so we're not having any weight i'm just going to lay out my chips and i want to know if you guys are here at this point in the video tell me your favorite nacho nacho no burrito tell me your favorite burrito flavor mine is chili heat um i do believe in the states the sweet chili heat isn't called sweet chili it's called like it's called i don't know what it's called i think it's a purple bag in the states but ours is black here and those are actually the only vegan flavored doritos the cool ranch ones just taste so bland but maybe are you guys dipping them in something because just by themselves they're like meh so i just laid out my chips and then i'm just gonna go take my oil and microwave it in the microwave for i don't know 20 seconds 23 seconds until it melts so i'll be right back so i just melted up my oil and i was going to use my spoon to kind of drizzle it over but then i thought it'd be easier if i just use one of these if you're trying to get exact dosage there's other methods that you should use but when it comes to like dripping and spraying it's not exact um but you can get close to it because you can do your amount of chips and you can measure out a quarter cup of oil or whatever amount of oil and then use that'll be too much oil for this but and then use whatever amount of oil you have on your chips and that can tell you how much is on those if you want to figure out how to calculate the dosing for your infusions i will attach a link um of a video where i explain it in like and explain like i'm five version like really like the most basic we can go so now we're gonna add our oil or butter to our chips so i'm just gonna zoom in the camera you guys can see a little bit better okay so like i said if you don't have a little dropper thing if you have a little dropper you can use um your spoon but i have a dropper so i'm going to be using the dropper so i'm just going to suck some of the oil up and i'm just going to kind of distribute it it does yeah see and i'm still i'm still even making a little mess but it does um the butter and oil has a really nice taste and i don't know texture to them when they're cooked it's just like oh my god when you bite into it it's so tasty so you can also turn them around and do that but i feel like the oil is going to drop off if i do that i'm going to cook them for a bit and let the oil kind of attach and then we can flip them and add more i want these to be very very strong so we're going to layer it up oops but you don't have to do that you can just do one layer you can do two layers three layers four layers honestly i wouldn't pass four layers i feel like it would just get a little too oily and buttery okay now we got our butter on these oil let's just say i used the word butter and oil interchangeably in this video it doesn't really matter and we're going to put these in the oven i preheated to 250 degrees and then we're going to check on them in about 10 minutes we're going to have them in the oven for about anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much you end up adding how much they need to cook you can kind of just go with how the texture of them is when they come out but gonna flip them and move them around every 10 15 ish minutes so let's go put these in and then set a timer so now they're in the oven i have timer set for 15 minutes in 15 minutes we're going to come back and we're going to check on them and decide whether um to flip them to add more to put them back in yeah we'll see so i'll see you guys shortly the doritos are still cooking but i missed something very important but it's not too late so we're going to do it now if you haven't already noticed in the background how could i forget something so important i'm sure you guys can hear the timer going off but i'll be there in a minute a few minutes doesn't make a difference for flipping taste it burnt i gotta go oh why is it so bitter what did i do burn it oh you okay so they were in the oven for about 16 minutes and i want to show you guys something because this is because i was being greedy i wanted to be like so strong so i was just like putting too much oil on them and don't do that you're better off just doing a little bit of oil and then letting it cook and then flipping it and doing the same thing because i'll show you guys what happened so some of these over here i like put well you guys can see some of these over here i put something over here i put so much oil on and when you lift them up you can see it leaked through some of the oil like yes this is like drenched in oil too but i put a little bit too much so it was like leaking underneath most of them are fine and there's um not really any like oil that went through but the ones that i put like so much on it definitely seeped through a little bit so the first time you try it just like go light don't don't put that much that's unnecessary anyway i was just like i said it was being a little greedy so now we're to put these back in the oven and i'm not going to flip them because um these ones i feel like they're not like dried up yeah if they're more dry then i would flip them and at this point you would if you want to add more you would flip them over and add more oil and then you can put it back in the oven but because i went like oil crazy and loaded them up i'm not gonna add more oil to these ones so we're just gonna put them back in the oven and we're gonna check on them every 10 to 15 minutes um until they're ready and it'll be anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour so it's been another 15 minutes and i took them out and honestly they were still too oily so what i decided to do is i just took another piece of parchment paper and transferred them over and then i'm going to pour whatever was collected on the sheet onto those ones there so they can absorb it again if you want to be like more precise you could put it like on a spoon or something but i feel like this works pretty well and it's like completely changed color i guess because it like took the seasoning off with doritos now we have these oh after another 15 minutes so it's been 45 minutes total now they're pretty much you can see they're starting to crisp up a little bit in some spots i'd say these could be done now or we could do another 15 minutes i think i'm just going to call these ones done but like i said you could do another 15 minutes it's just up to how long you want to keep doing it you can do it up to an hour honestly even more but just keep an eye on that every like five or ten minutes once you get up there but yeah these look good so i'm just going to let them sit up to dry for a bit and then i'm going to pack them back up so i'm going to put them back into the doritos bag but you shouldn't do that if there's people around you who might accidentally eat from the dorito bag otherwise you want to like make sure they're clearly marked so that it's obvious what they are and people who aren't shouldn't be eating them don't eat them um but i'm just myself here so there's no chance of someone else eating them how could i forget to taste one they're really good but i could tell i won't be able to eat a whole bag of them you know you could eat like a whole bag of doritos but because of how much fat is on them like in the oil i can tell they're like filling like it was like effort to eat that one like i probably would only be able to eat a handful of them which is good because i need the control so now i'm going to pour them into back into the dorito bag and then maybe like with the oil i like use some bread to like scoop it up and eat it that's an excellent idea actually and then to seal this bag and like i said you don't want to do this if you have somebody who might mistake this as a regular bag because i'm gonna like reseal it like don't get me wrong the resealing will not look the same at all but i got this little thing and like i bought it on amazon for like five bucks or something and you can like refill bags so that's pretty cool i'm pretty sure it works on shipping so we'll find out so if i mess this up you can't really oh it worked i thought i can't do it from the other side it worked i don't know if you guys can like see how it's sealed like it's not super great quality seal or anything but it is sealed oh see i missed the spot right there but the rest of it is sealed slide it across and the heat like squishes it together and yeah anyways oh wow you guys can see my whole setup this is what i'm working with here i have like chairs and like different pieces of furniture all stacked together so i can get high enough i don't know i don't have a lot of places to take videos in here you know anyways thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give me a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much have a wonderful day i want to like open these for like a dramatic ending but i actually just want to leave them sealed okay bye", "YFry3A09DL4": "what's up youtube and welcome back to my channel girly ganja and in today's video as you guys can tell i am going to be doing another cooking with cannabis video and today i am going to be using ghirardelli caramel turtle premium brownie mix so it's gonna be very basic y'all obviously i'm just gonna be mixing the cannabis butter with that which i have right here and this has a thousand milligrams of chc and six milligrams of cbd per packaging and it has 100 servings within this so i'm really excited to be trying it out with a brownie in my last cooking with cannabis video i did a seafood mukbang and i mixed it in there and it was really good and a lot of you guys wanted to know like how did it go did i get high did i not and y'all right after that video i went straight to sleep and i woke up feeling like like i had the best sleep of my life so i'm really excited to try this today my first ever edible that i had was a brownie i feel like that's pretty standard for most people but let me know what you guys have had like what was your first ever edible that you've ever tried put it in the comment section below and if you guys want to see me make this then go ahead and keep on watching okay so i got all the ingredients here make sure that you guys if you guys are making this then obviously the instructions will be on the back if you guys are making anything else then just make sure you follow the normal guidelines um i'm going to be using just this um butter infused cannabis that i got from my local cannabis store and if you guys see my last video you've seen that i portion these out it's kind of cold so let me take it out and show you so what i did with my can of butter is if you guys can see they're cut into like little triangles right because my thought is is since i don't know how to portion you know what it is i basically just looked at the um box here and it says 100 servings per container so i cut it into um so many different triangles and then i use one so for example this one based on my math calculations is about 12 servings right so that's how i do it so i'm basically about to put in 12 servings into my brownies so obviously if you want one serving then now i know to cut my brownies into 12 pieces and that will do the damn thing so that's what we're going to do so that's how i portioned mine out let me know how you guys portion yours i don't know i just kind of did it like that just so i can have a better gauge and make it pretty potent so i'm going to just go ahead and stick with that and then next time around if i need more then i'm going to maybe make the triangles bigger next what you're going to do is whip it so that's it that is my mix the main reason why i'm trying to make edibles more you guys is because i'm actually um gonna try to like cut back a little bit on smoking i just i'm not i'm gonna cut back just a little bit you know just test it out but i haven't really had good experiences with edibles every time i do an edible i go crazy like i'm literally like on the toilet okay so fun fact y'all i don't even really like chocolate but i like brownies y'all like that and don't even trip y'all talking about cross contamination i'm gonna be the only one eating these and my husband and he knows he knows the vibes so don't worry about me licking the spoon and using it not sharing it's only mine okay so i got it all up in my pan and i'm going to just even it out and that's it you guys oh i almost forgot the caramel so it comes with caramel because y'all know it got that caramel drizzle i also want to do candies and when i say candies i just want to um like get the little mold and then make gummy candies so that when i'm on the go you know i can just do that so stay tuned but i had to bring it back to a brownie because that's like like edible 101 everybody has a brownie with an edible about to show you how this i actually got some let me hide off the mix all right there we go okay i'm gonna bake this in the oven for however long it says and then i'll be right back okay so it is all done the only thing i will say is on the like i had a few spots where i like dropped a hella caramel and as you can see it made it like a hole so next time i wish i i could do like more better swirls but this is it i'm about to cut it up and portion it okay so i cut them in 12 like i said each is a serving so this right here is one serving it looks hella big huh but i figure it's got to be right so i'm about to eat this whole thing and then i'm gonna give this one to my husband because i need another guinea pig to try one also let's try it cheers that's good but it's something strong at all i don't i don't taste the weed but that's what i said yeah last time when i ate the butter i was like i didn't think it was strong but and if my calculations are right this is one serving i can kind of taste it now yeah a little bit um it's good though so we're gonna see like i said i'm gonna eat this whole thing so we're gonna see if it what it does how i feel i'm gonna give it like 30 minutes and i just ate it real quick so you",

when the merch drop is happening say mom please can i have money i want goblin merch she'll say yes okay go tell your near tell someone about it all right share the news it's big news either way hope you guys enjoy it let's dive right into it so this happened way long time ago in my sophomore year of high school this was this was like five years ago at this point and at the time this was my first time ever making weed brownies right i'd never done it before and i you know on this particular day i was kicking it with a good group of friends of mine bobby who i'm sorry i'm sure pardon me some of you og's probably remember and there was also alec and eric and there was a bunch of other people and they all ended up coming over to my house back then it was a pretty common thing after school that because my mom would work until late at night i'd have a lot of friends over and we'd go smoke weed and you know chill out and have a good time right so on this particular day all the homies come over and we decide that we're gonna make some brownies you know i had a couple friends in the friend group who sold weed and they were all re-upping that day and they said you know what let's make some brownies we can make some money at the time i was pretty broke and they were gonna give me a good chunk of brownies just for letting them cook them there so i was down as [ __ ] i was like absolutely what if i get some brownies for this hell yeah bro i'll help cook the [ __ ] and i did a good chunk of the cooking actually i did i did some whipping in the kitchen dude but either way so we end up getting together you know we smoke a little bit of weed and we run up to the grocery store and at the grocery store we grab a couple ingredients listen there's gonna be a bunch of people in the comments talk about goblin man tell me how to do it man why man you should explain how to do it listen if you don't know how to cook weed brownies by now it's 20 20 dude i don't know what to tell you bro it's very easy all right super easy we went to the store all we got was brownie mix and some cooking oil that's all you need dude that's all hey hey we don't need nothing else from there if you want to get fancy sprinkle a little sugar on top or something like that but [ __ ] that you got a box of brownies and some cooking oil and you go back to the house right so we grab the resources we need you know hey we go loot up if you will and we go back home right we go back to my house we're all chilling out we're just smoking blunts you know and how my mom's house was laid out she lived in a condo right she used to live in one uh this is the house i grew up in she doesn't live there anymore neither do i but hey ancient old property if you will right so it was like this kind of this condo thing so we had a balcony right so we would always just go outside smoke on the balcony walk back in go to the kitchen and you know it'd be a good [ __ ] time right so we're chilling out we're doing that we're smoking on the balcony and i came to find out later that our neighbors complained about it all the time i never knew this growing up but apparently like the the neighbors complained to like the building and everything and hey either a different story story for a different day all right so we're chilling out we're smoking our blunts we're having a hoot you know and we're going in the kitchen and we start up our cooking right and i had no idea what i was doing at this point but we had a we had a buddy there we're gonna call ernie who he knew what he was doing he was kind of like the head chef of this situation you know and he was like yeah do you just take the [ __ ] burner and put it on low put some oil and ground up flour in there and just let it simmer dude and then we need coffee filters right i forgot to mention that you need to grab coffee filters or like something to strain out like strain things out of liquid you know so we did coffee filters on that particular day so either way i don't know i think it was cheesecloth i don't think it was coffee filters coffee filters like a really really struggle way to do it but i think it was cheesecloth it was it was something like that either way i haven't i don't remember exactly what it was i haven't used this method in a very long time this is like the the classic high school method of making edibles you know but either way so we're cooking these up having a hoot having a holler smoking our kush just having a jolly old time and the house stunk listen we didn't use good weed for this right and there was like five of us sitting at the table all grinding weed we didn't have good weed you know a very common theme in my stories at least the high school era ones are whenever i would have like a small bag of personal i'd get it from cody's brother and it would be good it would be great [ __ ] weed like it would be [ __ ] that to this day still holds up as just top shelf great cush right but whenever i was with this group of friends a lot of them didn't buy off of cody's brother they bought off of their own plugs because they sold so this was the mid gathering the mid party all right and we were cool with it we were high schoolers who cares now everyone's smoking all this designer weed nah [ __ ] back then now dude we we didn't do that [ __ ] so either way we're always grinding up this mid and we've got it going in the pan and the smell oh my god i wasn't ready for the smell honestly at first i thought they were just asking me to cook the brownies at my house because they just like their parents were home or something but after the smell started going through the house i understood immediately i was like holy [ __ ] my mom's gonna beat me bro she's gonna strike me down she's gonna start swinging and hitting me the the swings are gonna connect you know like this is [ __ ] and i'm sitting there and i'm kind of realizing and listen the best way i can describe the smell is it doesn't smell like weed okay it doesn't smell like you're smoking weed it doesn't smell good it's it's like a very musty smell because you're not quite burning the weed it's just like damp oiled up browning kush and it smells so shitty it smells god god-awful any of you guys have ever made weed brownies using this method before you know what i'm talking about using like the oil method it's awful and you can do butter too but listen man that [ __ ] stanks either edibles are just a stinky thing okay it's there's never not a stink going on when you're making a batch of edibles you know a batch of brownies you know maybe there's some other ways that don't stink but in my experience oh listen dude you better you better live on your own and not have parents around you know and on this particular day i i think i kind of overestimated the amount of time we'd have because we were making two batches right so we're cooking up this oil and the house is stinking up and we finally get it done and we filter it through the cheesecloth or whatever it was i don't really remember honestly right we filter it all into a water bottle and then we start the brownie portion of it which from that point forwards all you do is you just make a brownie recipe but replace the like cooking oil or the vegetable oil with the new like weed oil that you just made you know the infused [ __ ] right so that's all there is to it it's it's super easy and as soon as my friend ernie showed me that i was like my dude why have i not been doing this like what like this is the easiest [ __ ] ever what the [ __ ] like sure it's stinky but all we did was just sit there every like couple minutes go stir the pan around and then go smoke blunts the whole time you know like it was just your average function except we stirred a pot every now and then like that [ __ ] was sick not it was a it was a saucepan not a pot but either way you get what i'm getting at right so that [ __ ] was perfect so we start making our brownies and we ended up doing two batches of them we were gonna do one but we were like you know what we we can make it stretch like we can do two because we didn't really think about the pan portion of it and we had this really tiny pants where you're like you know what we're just gonna do two batches we'll cut a small whatever right so we we do that you know we cook them up and we cut it very close boys i'm talking [ __ ] got dangerous once the second batch got in my mom by the time everyone left my mom was getting home within like maybe an hour and a half and the house was still airing out and we started cooking these brownies at like 3 p.m right i'm pretty sure we even all collectively skipped our last period class just to go cook these if i remember correctly like we were on some goon [ __ ] and it still took all day dude we were working but at the end of it i remember it was kind of funny because we had a buddy of mine a good personal friend of mine named jason right long time friend of mine known this kid since preschool literally preschool and he lived across the street right he hits me up while i'm cooking these brownies and he just asked me what i was doing and i was like yo it'd be fun as [ __ ] to have this kid over let's invite him over and at the time he didn't smoke very much at all like he wasn't really like he wasn't smoking he didn't do the kind of stuff that i did he was just a good like childhood friend of mine right so i'm like yo bro like you should come over dude and you know it also mind you he didn't smoke a ton but he did smoke flour he'd never done edibles so i hit him up and i'm like yo dude [ __ ] you should come over like i got a bunch of homies over i got bob and all them come through do they all want to see you it'll be busting he's like bet i'll be there in five minutes so he literally i'm talking walks out of his house walks across the street bam at my crib so he gets there and comes upstairs and we let him eat the batter like the brownie batter you know with the with the oil mixed in we're like oh the raw batter of course because we had a whole bunch left in the bowl we were like my dude if you want to scrape this [ __ ] go crazy right and he's like oh thanks guys so we let him scrape it and he scrapes like the whole [ __ ] bowl dude he scrapes the whole [ __ ] bowl out dude i'm talking there was a lot left honestly like i'd say probably like maybe two three brownies worth managed to scrape the sides clean dude it looked like that [ __ ] right came out the dishwasher when he was done dude it was crazy and he eats all the batter and this kid oh my listen i don't know if i've ever told the story on youtube i'm getting a little off topic here but this kid if i've ever talked on stream or in a video about the kid who used to dolphin dive off my balcony it was this guy every time he got him stoned he'd like get really reckless and self-destructive and he'd like jump off balconies and [ __ ] he's the craziest guy i've ever met when he's high when he's sober very tame normal dude but when he's when he's on anything he's just [ __ ] mental right it's like you flip a switch it's so funny but either way so he does that today right but he kind of climbs down he he didn't dive off you know he does that today we we feed him this batter you know and then we go on cooking the rest of our batch another hour goes by you know and at this point we're getting close to the time i was mentioning before when the homies were all about to leave and you know it was like maybe an hour and a half out of my mom coming home you know and once we finish up the second batch you can tell that that [ __ ] smacked jason in the face you could tell my man was just so obliterated dude he's sitting there he's high as [ __ ] he's talking slow he's slurring his words it seemed like he was wasted even though he was just stoned right i came to find out later he was on some sort of medication that did that to him but at the time i had no [ __ ] idea i didn't know that right so i'm just like yo are you good bro and he's like yeah dude i'm i'm lit bro i'm having a blast right i'm having a good time so you know we're chilling out and finally it comes time when everyone's got their brownies cooked they cut me my you know my share of it which i got a good chunk of brownies i will say i got like uh i think they gave me like a third of a tray of them like just for [ __ ] being the one whose house they did i threw like no weed bro i had like two grams of bud and the only bud that i had i just threw it to blunts you know like i just matched with the homies all the buds there was oh you know all the homies i had they're sold weed those are the guys you mainly threw for these brownies and they you know the homies i had they just cut me you know a third of the batch which was sick dude i got [ __ ] i got baked they were actually some good brownies right but either way we finish up cooking these brownies and the time comes to get the [ __ ] out so i'm like all right boys everyone's got to get out of the house you know my mom's coming home soon i gotta really air it out in here so alec he goes and he grabs the fan out of my room and he kind of helps me set up like a little wind tunnel where like the wind you know the kind of breeze would come in through my balcony and then go out through my kitchen window so he helped me set that up and after we had that all set up you know we're good to go right we just left the balcony door open and while the balcony door is open jason goes out there and he's like all right guys i'm a dip see ya and he just goes over the edge he just goes over the balcony and i look over and he's like shimmying down he didn't like literally dive off but this [ __ ] i don't know why he did this every time whenever he going home because my house was like like the back my balcony was facing his crib he'd just leave via balcony all the [ __ ] time this guy was but he'd like dive off like he [ __ ] up his collarbone one time it was really [ __ ] but either way all the homies dip and at this point i'm kind of realizing like oh [ __ ] my mom's gonna be home in an hour and a half and i like this house stinks bro it doesn't necessarily smell like weed but i feel like with with how i am she would know it has to be something weed related come on i'm never up to any good when she's not home you know she's not gonna come home to some stink and be like oh he must have just made some [ __ ] raviolis which is exactly what i told her she comes home in an hour and a half and she's pissed as [ __ ] as soon as she walked in the door she's like nick what the hell is that smell she's pissed she's had enough bro and you can tell just by the tone she had a bad day at work dudes it was it was not going to be pretty right so i'm like oh i microwaved some [ __ ] i burnt it like it really smells bad she was not having she was like i'm sick of this i'm sick of you [ __ ] up my house she comes in she's like what are all the dishes in the sink and [ __ ] and i i just i had no excuse for the dishes in the sink i didn't think far ahead enough to like run them through the dishwasher and put them away i was just like i'll just put them in the sink you know i i literally had no explanation for it i was just like oh like i don't know you know i picked up all the brownie box and all that [ __ ] threw it in the garbage but i just had no explanation for any of the [ __ ] in the sink and she had had enough of it dude so she laid into me she grilled me and eventually just kind of left me alone and i went through the rest of my night dude hey it was a hoot and i had a third of a tray of brownies dude i actually got stoned that night dude actually after she finished yelling at me i smacked a couple of those brownies hey i was chilling dude but either way thank you all so much for tuning in i appreciate you don't forget merch drop december 1st baby hey be there be ready to rumble thank you guys for watching i'll see you guys next time peace out gamers", "3JUqfwHqKS8": "what's going on guys Austin ff8 here or Luna so this story is something I've been just kind of holding back on ever since I did the first weed brownie story or the edible story I had a funny story that involving my parents that I think you guys are gonna like [ __ ] your pants at so by the way I'm getting a new microphone I'm getting the blue Yeti and I'm really excited because I've been using the same microphone for a very long time so I'm very excited to get the new one so I'm not sure when that one's coming probably like this I think it's coming the February like 17th or something so it's gonna be a little bit but I can't wait to use it for commentaries cuz now it's just better sound for your ears so anyway I'm gonna jump right into this so it's called my mom accidentally ate weed brownies and it's pretty [ __ ] crazy so to start things off this was actually it's a funny story cuz it wasn't too long ago this was like a little over six months ago so more towards the beginning of my YouTube channel and I am it actually happened pretty recently it happened right when I started my channel but this was before I was doing really life stories I guess you could say so um yeah I just kind of waited on it so to start things off at the time I was on a break for smoking I didn't smoke any weed it might have been around the time that I was quitting I can't really remember but I remember I had a friend over and this friend had like literally a straight-up batch of pot brownies in his backpack and I I told him I'm like yo don't bring those over don't bring pot brownies over sure enough what does he do he brings pot brownies over so he's got all these edibles in his backpack I'm pretty sure he had like a whole batch of pot brownies and like a huge sip lock sealed airtight bag and he had a bag of two like with two weed cookies in him so later that night he asked me if I wanted to do something like 3 in the morning and I was immediately immediately like nah [ __ ] that I didn't like his at the time edibles for me were like I don't know I just wasn't doing to him that gave me a weird high so I was like nah I'm not into a man he's like alright he's like you mind if I do one I'm like fine you can have one and he ate one so he left the pot brownies in the basement where we did them on the foosball table and then we went into my room which is upstairs in the hallway so he's sitting in the the basement he loved these pot brownies sitting in the basement and we're upstairs on my computer and we're watching funny videos the highs kicking him in the face while he's laughing keep in mind this was like 45 minutes after we've been in my room so the high is definitely starting to hit him a little bit more and he is kind of a lightweight kid so it hit him quicker than usual and he's just sitting there like giggling we're watching videos of screaming goats and [ __ ] and he's laughing and then he goes oh [ __ ] I'm like what he's like I think I left the pot brownies downstairs and I was like how do you leave a batch of pot brownies downstairs and we go down there and I'm I see her come upstairs and she's like oh my god I'm like what she's like who made those brownies and I was like oh my god like when I saw her come upstairs my heart dropped a little but I already knew like there's no way she doesn't she's like a gluon freak she doesn't like anything with bread or like spongy material because it like upsets her stomach so I don't think she ate any but she came I stare she's like who made those brownies and I was like oh me and my friend made them in cooking class because at the time I um last year I was taking a cooking class well actually I wasn't taking it he was taking the cooking class and it was funny cuz I was like a summer class his parents were mad at him for smoking all this weed so they stuck him in this really bad kid like program where he had to do cooking arts and crafts and all this [ __ ] that like normally really straightedge kids would do so he got punished that way and one day this week I are not this week but that week I went with him to do it with him because he was like please come with me man it's so boring so I went with him and we actually did end up taking a cooking class there and we actually had to make brownies so it was a perfect lie and she's like oh really and I was like yeah when we were in the cooking class we made brownies she's like they're pretty good they're decent I was like thanks mom and and then my one friend was like you tried them and she's like yeah and I was like oh my god and I'm sitting here thinking I'm like all right it's okay Austin like she's gonna go to bed soon she'll fall asleep she won't even know that she's high she'll just pass out and then wake up and the high will be gone well boy was I wrong I'm sitting there okay and we're sitting there in my room at the time and we're just sitting here like what are we gonna do dude she ate pot brownies and I keep my gosh she's only she only had like a half of one so we actually went into her room yeah like 30 minutes later and she was like oh I don't feel so good look what's wrong she's like I don't know my stomach's really like messed up and I was like oh well mate you want like you want like a tums like he's your stomach upset like acid she's like I don't know yeah sure just bring me one so I wrote her a tums which is meant for like acid indigestion and stuff like that so I gave her a tums and I was like is that better she's like yeah a little bit and she's sitting there and then another thirty minutes go by and then you can see it happening her eyes are turning glassy she's getting there she's laughing and I was like oh my God my mom stoned I got my mom stoned oh my god and she's sitting there like watching TV and then she goes into the kitchen and I'm like what are you doing she's like I want some gingersnaps and if you guys to know what ginger snaps are they're like a cookie that you eat they're like ginger cookies they're really good she starts eating this whole box of ginger cookies and then I told her I'm like mom why don't you go to bed I thought you weren't feeling good she's they got I'm I'm okay my stomach hurts still and then she goes into her room and she started getting um her stomach started hurting again because these brownies I don't know I think he made them really wrong and like even he had stomach problems when he ate them and he she was in bed and she just started grabbing her stomach she's like oh I got a cramp but I was like what's wrong she's like I have to go to the bathroom so she goes into the bathroom and she's sitting there and I remember if she was in the bathroom sitting there and I I she wasn't actually going to the bathroom she was just sitting there on the toilet like just with like her pants were still out on everything she was just sitting there I was icky okay so yeah I don't know I don't feel very good I feel like I'm about to throw up I was like really I thought you had to go to the bathroom she's like I don't know can hold on get out for a second and she was really like she even said my head it feels weird I feel different I feel like impaired and I was just sitting there I'm like oh my god what

from cocoa bakes and I'm here to show you how to make my budgie chocolate vegan brownies you will surprise anybody and they won't even know they're vegan and we're going to need three tablespoons of water one and a half tablespoons chia seeds which is new to me is great and gels up kind of like an egg wood and we're going to need 1/2 cup coconut oil in replacement of butter 1 cup sugar 3/4 cups gluten-free flour 1/2 a cup applesauce one and a half cups almond flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda which isn't typical in a brownie recipe but it does help the rising process since you don't have the eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt of course 3/4 cups or 10 ounces of bittersweet vegan chocolate first I'm going to go over and turn the oven on to 350 degrees then I always like to line my pan first so I have my parchment paper in my pan I always like to aisle it so that the parchment paper sticks to the pan so if I smooth out batter that stays that way stays in its form so now I'm just going to push down into the corners and try and smooth it out as much as possible make sure it's Six's sides pretty simple and next we're going to make the Chia egg because that has to sit for about five minutes so to do so we put our chia seeds in the bowl and then we measure out our water it's going to be 3 tablespoons to one and a half tablespoons of chia seeds so we'll just let this sit for about five minutes and while it's sitting we're going to go melt our chocolate and our coconut oil together and you want to make sure that you get every last drop of coconut oil or else I would have put less in the recipe and to melt this you're going to put it on by memory which is just like a boiling pot of water and you'll just let it sit there on low heat until it's melted I don't really have a time for it you just kind of let it sit until you see it's melted and while that's kind of simmering and melting together we're going to come back and mix all of our flowers together so we're going to put the almond flour you can use cashew or almond or hazelnut whatever you have available it gives it a little bit of body and a better texture and the gluten-free flour together and you can use just like a store-bought gluten-free flour they're all pretty much all purpose so we're going to put the baking soda in just going to add a half a teaspoon of salt I'm going to mix this together just to make sure everything is smooth and evenly incorporated we're going to go check the coconut oil and chocolate mixture now and don't forget your spatula so it looks like it's starting to mount I can hear the water boiling under it you want to make sure that it's not too hot because you don't want the chocolate along the sides to burn and also be careful if you're stirring over you might burn yourself chocolates ready so we're going to bring it back over to the station and turn the stove off and so now we're going to add the sugar the vegan sugar then next we're gonna add all of the applesauce a great replacer for kind of fudgy silky smooth feeling then we're gonna revisit our Chia egg and see how that's doing and you can see it's kind of gelled and goopy and a little bit gnarly you're gonna put all of that in here and mix them all together so now you have your sugar your applesauce coconut oil chocolate Chia egg inherence can be a little goopy and it's gonna go into your flour mix now the bowl is really hot damn it's gonna go into the flour mix so we started making these vegan brownies when I had customers come up to me at a farmers market and tell me that they demanded vegan brownies I mean I guess that everybody should be able to eat what they want especially if you're vegan or gluten-free whatever you are it shouldn't make a difference and that's why I started making this it's chocolatey it's fudgy it's delicious and it's pretty simple so now the last step is to pour our batter into the pan so we'll just dump it right in and I have an 8x8 pan you can use a 9 by 9 you might have to decrease the bake time by maybe 2 minutes so instead of 37 minutes will be 35 I'm just going to spread it out and if you want this is a great time in the last step when we mix it all together to add any sort of nut you want you can add like about a quarter cup of chopped nuts maybe a half a cup if you're really into nuts and that's it I'm going to put this in the oven now 350 degrees for 37 minutes it's been 37 minutes and the brownies are done and it smells so chocolate in here so this is what they should look like a little bit thunking a little bit dark round the edges and just smell amazing they need to cool for about an hour and a half until they're completely cool to the touch just because if you don't let them cool they will crumble they're vegan the brownies have been cooling for about an hour and a half now if you just can't wait to bring them out of the pan go ahead and cut it in the pan so you can choose the size you cut it into I'm more of like a big brownie girl so I'm going to go ahead and try and cut it as best I can into 1/3 and then in half again try and get it out with my spatula and if you've cooled it long enough it should come out in one piece let's see if I did amazing it looks fudgy it smells so good there we go Ramola there's chocolate there sugar a gooey it's delicious go try it and for the recipe click on the bubble", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned yes yes hey attend for the chuckles one love one love [Music]", "308jpcN_4_8": "hello welcome back to the potli kitchen you've got Felicity and Chris and today we're going to attempt to make vegan brownies attempt to me oh we're gonna make them that's the attitude but I've done a lot of research I've found this girl her name is chocolate-covered Katie on the world wide web and she her recipe by far has had the most amount of reviews it has like 4.9 stars for like I think it was like 500 reviews which is a lot and so the community is like this is the vegan recipe and what we're going to be using from potli is our olive oil our THC a to CBD 250 milligram 1 to 1 ratio olive oil in this recipe and I think it's gonna work so I've done the math and essentially it comes out to be exactly about a hundred and sixty-two milligrams that go in we know that our conversion from THC a to THC is about point eight so that makes it a hundred and thirty milligrams for this entire batch that we're gonna make and if we cut these into cute little you know 24 squares that's about five milligrams per square so I think it's gonna work so we're gonna start with combining the dry ingredients the dry ingredients I apologize so we're going to start with combining the wet ingredients so it's a half a cup of milk and two tablespoons of your milk of choice okay we went to Trader Joe's we did a huge haul and they have an oat beverage not an oat milk I think there's a legal issue but we know what it is we know it's open oh yeah you have a rating ranking ranking system of all of the milk substitutes my foot Oh up there and hemp and pee milk oh god here so you can actually choose any of those three and two two of the tablespoons I believe that's a half tablespoon so you're gonna do four of those so and then we do a half a cup of our olive oil and three tablespoons per cup that's correct so baking is all about precision if you don't get it right yeah you're just not gonna end up with what you intended to make so be precise mm-hmm I'm very excited about this so and the third ingredient to add in there is a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract we have this for flavor so THC a is the precursor the acid version of THC essentially it's a rock Nav annoyed TCA has been said to have so many incredible benefits from cancer reducing cells and you know increasing appetite and also it's super anti-inflammatory so is the CBD so it's just incredible that this acid form of THC is non psychoactive but has all these incredible benefits but the cool or thing about thca is that when you add heat and time it converts the THC a to THC and that's exactly what we're doing today we're doing a little experiment in which we are taking the THC a and current Verdean and then making them into vegan brownies cool so second part is to mix the dry ingredients so in a separate Bowl we have a half a cup of unsweetened cacao a cup of gluten-free flour 1/4 tablespoon 1/8 tablespoon of salt this is very specific 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar and today instead of white sugar we have something that we received at the founder of a trade show which is the monk fruit sweetener it's a white sugar replacement so we're gonna be doing this is a very healthy vegan brownie recipe so yeah we're just gonna be doing the most and then you can at that time mix in 2/3 cups of mini chocolate chips just for extra spice spicy that's cacao powder right hmm it's also organic and fair trade mm-hmm I'm really into that Trader Joe's packaging sponsor s it's just like the perfect size you know you don't always need like a whole like massive bag full flower flour so you need another cup of this well this is not super dainty you can I'd also recommend sifting it first oh yeah but we don't have time for that Chris has got to catch a flight after this okay that's why we're not taking the flower Oh brown sugar 1/2 cup molasses flavor yeah I've always had a thing for brown sugar thank you for brown you know that raw sugar than the brown packages I used to just eat that out of the bag which is horrible what makes brown sugar brown do you know it's molasses Oh brown sugar typically equal parts molasses and white sugar Wow who would have thought how'd you know that would you learn that ooh okay I need my white sugar or 1/3 cup incredible um half a tablespoon okay baby come on hurts sweetener also can be a little bit more than normal sugar [Applause] [Music] of this sweetener alternative okay it needs a half teaspoon and not a tablespoon I'm glad I like double-checked and then I have your baking soda here as well incredible thank you I don't need baking soda it's not on the menu okay great and then a tablespoon of two tablespoon of cornstarch offset on fed Oh incredible and then 2/3 cup of the chocolate chips I love these brownies I feel like the classic edible is the brownie mm-hmm so this is kind of an updated take on that and B it also uses the a olive oil and use that natural conversion process in order to get the impact that you want a big fear in people in baking with cannabis is that they're going to cook out the cannabis and so it's nice to bake with rtca olive oil because it's sort of alleviates that fear and you know the exact dosage of what it's going to be at most which you don't always get when you're just kind of creating your own oils so if you want to be very specific it is nice to get an oil that's already infused has already gone to a third lap for third party lab for testing and you know exactly what you're getting and you're toasting all your friends and family and your guests properly also like if you don't want THC at like brownies and you just want CBD brownies you can just use our hemp olive don't got to do that conversion but if you want to do a science experiment and like I need to get two tablespoons of that in here so if you just want to do that for this I can this is a half tablespoon it's so we need two more have you ever made a black water and cornstarch and it makes these like really clean science yeah play with it I don't know I'm always so it's like kind of weird but on my Instagram they always keep pushing me like slime videos and I'm just like for what reason why I don't understand why couldn't know what you're doing on the I don't know I don't know I don't know what I'm doing but I'm always pushed slime videos and they're like addicting I keep watching them that's why they're pushing that's you all right why don't you put so typically for dry ingredients you want to incorporate it into the wet in in thirds so why don't you guys get 2/3 into here and I'll start with you cool and then I think you have to line it right yes that's correct we have to line with parchment paper already look aspiring you know garden oh yeah that's not I also feel like it's kind of like such an edge okay that's correct our our oven is still heating up but when it's done so we're back it's 24 minutes later and we have our brownies here and they look so pretty it's up to me now because that Chris has left she's on a flight to LA and look you know it just it looks like a traditional brownie there's nothing wrong with it you know that like it's um it's a really easy cut we want to do seven slices so that we get the eight by eight that way it's five milligrams Pete per piece and that's really it oh my goodness we made vegan brownies guys who knew who would have thought that this was possible all right uh-huh well you know what I need to call a friend to try this eatle oh well yeah come on over all right all right it's got a nice consistency Cheers begin vegan brownies you can Brown Oh", "ZcjgB4zHaTs": "wondering how to make weed brownies what about healthy low carb dairy free weed brownies come on I'll show you how [Music] [Music] first in a small glass bowl measure out about 1/2 cup of honey you'll want to microwave it for about 30 seconds just to make sure it gets nice and liquidy then add 1/3 of a cup of cocoa powder to your honey in that same bowl mix it up and just mix it really really well in a separate slightly larger mixing bowl you'll what I go ahead and start mixing up your dry ingredients you'll want to add 1/2 cup of flour whole wheat is preferable but all-purpose will do then in your dry ingredients bowl add 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt mix all of these dry ingredients together until they're evenly mixed then going back to your cocoa powder and honey bowl and I I kind of messed up and I put my applesauce in the wrong bowl but I I think mine are gonna be ok anyway they're in the oven right now but you're gonna want to add 1/2 of a cup of applesauce into your cocoa powder and into your honey bowl go ahead and mix in some applesauce and if applesauce is not really your style that's okay you can use 1 banana instead mash it up first them in that same cocoa powder and honey bowl you're gonna want to go ahead and add in 2 tablespoons of your infused CBD or THC temp or cannabis infused coconut oil also add one raw egg and 1/2 TSP of vanilla extract which I also kind of wait until the end to add in but it was fine really you can also add chopped nuts of your choice at this time but that's just optional you definitely don't have to do that whip up these wet ingredients until everything is perfectly blended and mixed together then add your wet ingredients into your dry ingredients mixing bowl just mix everything up really really well now that everything's all mixed up you want to go ahead and get your 8x8 inch baking pan ready so go ahead and either grease the bottom of your pan or what I did is I use tin foil to line the bottom I feel like that's just an easier way to clean up but the aluminum foil is optional you can just use cooking spray instead or just grease the bottom of your pan lightly in some way pour in your mixture into the 8x8 and and pop it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes and that's it that's how you get your brownies take the tray out and let it sit for five minutes then transfer your brownies over to a wire cooling rack for calculated macro content cut your brownies into 16 equal sized parts if you use the complete list of ingredients that we mentioned above you should be left with about 73 total calories 1 gram of fat 14 grams of carbs one of which is fiber and 1 gram of protein that's it guys this recipe is super super easy it's really hard to mess up honestly and it should turn up some really delicious brownies every time before we wrap things up though let me just say a few things about the THC or CBD infused oil that you're using when it comes to TVD oil options there are so many different brands and different varieties out there so many different hemp-based CBD products to choose from but when it comes to something like THC you're either going to want to use a premade oil or concentrate or tincture or something like that that's gonna already have activated THC in it which you can get from a dispensary or you can infuse your own coconut oil at home like what I use you can use cannabis flour to infuse oil at home and you can do that if you want to or you can use a dispenser you bought oil however it is worth noting that if you are going to use something from a dispensary it's probably going to be pretty pricy and not necessarily the best bang for your buck when you're making brownies at home you're probably better off making your own infused coconut oil at home with cannabis flour also if I missed anything or if there's anything that you'd like to add assume my take on this recipe please feel free to let us know in the comments and we'll see you guys next time [Music] you", "cpMcaCsrFCs": "hey everybody they've all just here and I recently realized how important it is to me at least that I have a vaporizer in the kitchen when I'm cooking a nice Chianti or Merlot and a full crafty are definitely the main ingredients in all of my dishes seriously I've been thinking about how to use a vaporizer in my cooking to extract essential oils from herbs and put them into my beefs chickens porks and vegetables the more think about it the more I realize that these little ovens are capable of the same heat range that we cook food at so what can I do to actually cook food in a vaporizer so let's make some packs brownies medicated of course okay I started by cleaning the bowl and the air path was some ISO and then repeated this process with a q-tip that was lightly damp with water and allowed that to dry fully I used two syringes a one milliliter and a five milliliter a ziploc bag brownie mix an egg oil and water with a fully charged pax I lined the oven with cooking spray that I put on a q-tip definitely don't use more than it takes to coat any excess should be avoided just to be safe I used all natural coconut cooking spray empty the dry mix into the bowl then separately mix the wet ingredients and then add them to the dry ingredients mix until blended smooth and then add chocolate sauce if needed and if you wish you can shave some chocolate to sprinkle on top before you put it in the oven for the PAX brownie all you have to do is put some herbs in the bottom of the packs you can mix it in it's your choice but this is just a test so I put it in just a little bit to see what happened then I put some brownie mix into the corner of a ziplock and created a small pastry bag of sorts and cut off a tiny portion of the corner I filled the first five milliliter syringe and then used that syringe to fill the smaller 1 milliliter syringe it's a much more precise application you can really see what you're doing you don't want to add too much or that will definitely overflow as it rises when it begins to heat make sure you fill it only halfway full because of that my first attempt was on high temperature setting and I turned it on and just left it for a few minutes that was way too high and made a horrid cajun-style cookie and no good at all I played with the time and heat levels and found that the following worked perfectly you put your packs on the lowest temperature setting and leave the oven lid off turn it on for 10 seconds then turn it off for 30 seconds then on for 5 seconds off for 30 seconds and repeat that step 20 times over the next 12 minutes if used enough cooking spray the brownie should fall right out but if not try and tap it out otherwise you can push from behind the brownie via the air path also make sure the screen is not attached to the brownie not tasty it takes a crazy amount of attention to the oven heater but it was a complete success here are three perfectly edible attempts that would be excellent hors d'oeuvres at the launch party for the PAX 3 fax works just as it did before the brownies the bullseye loaded just after the brownies were probably the best-tasting I have ever had in my life do you need a new diet plan to cut down on overeating don't have enough oil for an entire batch of brownies the next time you want a portable bite size medal on the go look no further than the packs well I'm thinking about what else to cook in my packs make sure you subscribe to my channel and also head over to vaporizer vu comm for more info on the packs and other high end vaporizers", "F6hl6Z8-5UE": "and as soon as I said that Jeff's phase change from happy magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet man the sauce squad it's your boy man Yeung done the sauce

plate so you know what that means it's time for a new mini episode of wheats the marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "yuxKkIfxBE4": "STEPHANIA PLUS...

we are taking a look at a new Buddhist best product we've got the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate brownie us this is the second Buddha's best product that I have reviewed I looked at the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie before this also 300 milligrams really really liked it so I've got high hopes for this triple chocolate raspberry brownie let's take a look here standard packaging be sure to refrigerate it says again very nice of Buddhas best to incorporate a nutrition information and ingredients on the back not something you see in all of the edibles ingredients gold medal bread flour butter brown sugar egg cocoa raspberry preserves milk chocolate whole milk powder cocoa sugar vanilla extract and salt so all pretty normal ingredients in there and it looks like the entire brownie has about 360 calories in total not that bad what let's go ahead and open this bad boy up and give ourselves a taste all right nice and easy to open package again you never know with these edibles if that's gonna be the case or not sometimes you need some scissors handy alright so here is our brownie not the most appetizing looking brownie admittedly it's got some white chocolate chips I guess there maybe this is the raspberry preserves smells like you can smell the raspberry you can definitely smell the raspberry and no disturb or weed smell no marijuana smell whatsoever all right well let's go to taste what a politician what you could definitely definitely do the raspberry but not an overpowering way and there's a there's definitely a hint of raspberry in there the chocolates good I got some chocolate chips or the Makani or the white chocolate chips in there as well very tasty and I don't get any hint of marijuana whatsoever in the the taste so you don't like the taste of marijuana wow that's pretty good okay it's a rich brown he's a fudgy air brownie um take me some effort to eat this bad boy um but in the taste spectrum I like it but because I prefer the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie to this but you're not gonna be disappointed with this brownie for sure no weed flavor and just generally a pretty good taste um oh also just like the chocolate livers and will keep very affordable this brownies 300 milligram edible only cost me $10 just on the low end but I'm sure you can find it for you around you know 12 to 15 bucks but yeah clip one very important duties bus well okay yeah I found this bad boy in a dispensary and Huntington Beach which is in Orange County California I think they're Buddha's best is pretty widely distributed at all um but as we know from all our earlier reviews the most important thing when it comes to an edible is not actually how it tastes it's how you feel afterwards and like miss my rubies I'll check back with you guys in half an hour and an hour and an hour or in two hours unless you know how we're feeling I'm gonna finish this bad boy off and I'll see you guys in half an hour hi guys so we are back here with our review of the Buddhist best triple chocolate raspberry brownie it has been 30 minutes since I have consumed this bad way except that crumb I just got right there um 30 minutes it feeling a little bit definitely feeling something and definitely feeling it increasing the feeling amplifying um finish off that brownie still really really enjoyed it oh not as good as I think the Korova cookies in terms of the taste I mean it's good it's very good but but in terms of value you're certainly gonna get your money's worth so well we'll check back in half an hour and see how this 300 milligrams of THC is is hitting us is hitting us in another thirty minutes we will check back then alright well it has been one hour since I consumed the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate raspberry brownie medical cannabis with hybrid cannabis product and things are going pretty well I you know going on cloud nine my guys okay sorry back on track Buddha's best in an hour after this 300 milligram edible I mean mostly the effects in my in my head right now not a lot in the body but the highest come on pretty strong and we're only an hour in so I'm expecting this to really ramp up to the next hour and we'll be sure to check with you guys back in at the two-hour mark as always well it's been two whole hours since I consumed that Buddha's best and Wow guys yeah it's the real deal I to be frankly honest I wish I had the whole thing not because it wasn't good it was great I just feel the whole [ __ ] day shot now man but if you know you actually want with the serving suggestion which is like not a whole one of these like maybe you know a sixth few one with the sixth of these of this that would be a wise investment buyer beware not because it isn't good but because it's too good no it's just right just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends if you liked this video please feel free to subscribe and if there are a procs you would like me to try in the future please just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to review it on a future episode of wheats thanks for watching we'll catch you guys next time", "RjuCqBkL-Z8": "[Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of YouTube my name is bud thanks for joining me today again as always what we have today is something kind of different I'm excited about it in fact very excited about to promote this company right now this is full spectrum farms I've kind of promoted them a little bit before with their infused vaping stuff which you know just vaping in general in my mind is not something I'm into but for people that are into it go through these guys because they have some amazing like Joule infused pods and stuff like that anyways full-spectrum farms dot CA check out their website you can buy weed on there you can buy edibles you can buy dual infused pods all sorts of things anyway I got a package from those guys and it is wrapped in a beautiful beautiful shirt that's a way so you can't see it first and that is this listening party shirt very cool check out that band if you can make sure you get that logo as this guy this dancing guy cuz there's a bunch of listening parties out there so you don't want to get the wrong one okay let's get down to business here so what we have is pretty fun we have infused grape drink and it's cool cuz it's a see-through on the back so you can see the powder and it basically says mix with 1 liter of water it is 150 milligrams THC if I had better eyes I could read a little bit more but it basically says that it contains THC that can ingredients and which is the active ingredient in the cannabis plant use responsibly start low go slow don't drive operate machinery while under the influence of can keep away from children and pets may cause drowsiness that is beautiful advice and I almost wish the writing was a little bit bigger so people really got the message it also says the ingredients are sugar oh man ok I wish I had read this something acid yeah a bunch of different things and THC that's what's important ok so we got the infused grape drink we also have the infused fruit punch so for people who like fruit punch same idea 150 milligrams THC so when you drink these products one thing to note is again go slow drink potentially 10 percent of what you make so start there and you know in an hour or so have more if you want the other things that we got here are one hilum 100 milligrams of 2 byte brownies THC to bite brownies very cool again spectrum farms he gave me we got two packs of this same kind of idea have a bite or two not much more see where it leaves you I'm actually gonna open this guy up and have a little bite I'm gonna say that I don't eat I don't do edibles very often but this stuff is from a really really reliable source I will probably you know eat this and hopefully get back to you in a little bit not a hundred percent sure about that we'll see anyways taking this guy out oh yeah smells just like the to bite brownies you get at the store okay I'm gonna have a little bite here get up close mmm-hmm ma'am I don't know about you guys but cannabis tastes delicious too amazingly good I think that will be good enough for now just one little bite and all I'll get back to you in a little bit here so again my name's bud think joining me on YouTube please subscribe click like and let me know what you want to see on this channel if you have any questions or comments I'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can and tell me your experiences eating cannabis or if you've actually bought from this website yet let me know I want to hear it from you guys alright thanks again oh ok guys it's been about an hour where'd it go you can tell it's been about an hour it is this is the to bite brownie that I had see if I can even open this guy here we go as I showed you before that's about as much as I eat just a little bite Oh down there and I am feeling quite body stone just off of that a little bit I'm personally not used to it like some people probably are I'm sure just like smoking cannabis you gain the tolerance towards those sorts of things so I think it's probably the same when it comes to eating it but it definitely comes in like comes in like waves at first when you first start to get stoned off of it it like almost makes you feel and I'm not saying this in a negative way this is just how I personally react to any kind of drug that you have to eat is it like there's this weird sense of like anxious nausea that starts to quit and as that subsides it becomes really really Pleasant and your muscles kind of start to relax and you start to feel your body actually starts to Oh stoned and good and actually I've been having my leg cramps in the last couple days and I feel like this might help with that because it's just kind of like my muscles are just losing but yeah it's really nice anyways thanks again I'm bud see you soon [Music]", "LIyHhuuIMec": "what's one everybody welcome to my channel today we're gonna be making Oreo weed brownies so let's get into it [Music] so the ingredients to make this recipe to be two eggs butter 1/4 cup of water and also the brownie mix now here's a tip for you when you come down to the kind of butter make sure that it's at room temperature you don't want it to be cold like in the grouting so I'm going to fit a little bit you have your softest really you take on cutter [Music] all right so you're gonna first start with adding the brown in it [Music]

Christie so now it's like the divider so what its gonna do is it's gonna automatically even even out the shape of the brownies once it dries up so if you can get one of these dusty deep on this it'll make it a lot easier when it's time for you to make it really just be that much alright so now when we start working on a brown icing the first thing to do is put this into your bowl next I'm going to add the heavy cream [Music] now I'm going to add some kind of up to [Music] all right so now we're gonna put this in the double boiler been about thirty minutes so now my brownie is done so what I'm gonna do is let it cool down for about ten minutes and I'm overcome by ice and then in the meantime I'm also gonna ask them cannabase honey can you do it as well [Music] good thing about adding the cannabis if you use honey it's going to induce it even more but also by adding the honey it's going to give it more of that shiny look to it as well all right little bit about five minutes my brownie it's now cool so now I'm going to add two glaze [Music] iris anomaly does sit for another five minutes and dandy gonna decorate the Browns all right so once my own brownies go down I added the divider one more time so this is how it's gonna look once you remove the divider so what I'm gonna do now I'm just gonna decorate it so I'm gonna use whip cream and I'm gonna use Oreo cookies and I'd be done so let's get into it [Music] [Music] I'm right by over you big brownie amount done so thank you guys for watching this video [Music]", "8uhxx_FgY6E": "I think I was about 21 when I lost my mind I was living in this house with my best friend and this couple and the girl was cool but her boyfriend often had red eyes and the house always smelled really spicy when he came over So, we'll call him So, one night Sir Drugsalot said: \"Hey, I've got these MARIJUANA brownies, so let's try them, yeah?\" \"Who made them and what's the dosage?\" I should've said, but didn't And instead I said So we ate these things and they tasted strong Very strong indeed. I ate two because I had a medical condition back then called \"being a fucking idiot\". We planned an evening of Mario Kart and cake And watching the Matrix and deciding we were living in a simulation, etc. But, around an hour in, Sir Drugsalord said he felt a bit unusual and was going to bed \"Sir Drugsalot\"-I said-\"You can't go to bed, you gave us these, silly\" And he said -\"Yeah, but I didn't make them\" \"What?\"- I said \"Yeah, someone gave them to me, at a party... ...in Birmingham\" \"IN BIRMINGHAM?!\" we all yelled. \"So, you don't know how strong these are? These drugs from... BIRMINGHAM?\" *chaos at the door* \"It's fine\" -he said. And I guess that was when hell began because it started to fell a bit like, hmm... ahh, you know that feeling when you're going up in a lift but the lift is full of blue fire and you're convinced no one ever loved you and you can't remember hoW TO FUCKING BREATHE?! *IMPENDING DOOM* Yeah, so... Yeah, is like that, really. Everyone else at this point went to bed, but I'm an insomniac at least when I'm on drug fueled existential journeys into the unconscious anyways, so I laid down on the sofa for a bit. I got the TV on finally and it was halfway through Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I realized that I no longer had the dexterity to even change the channel so I made the best of it, and just leant back into whatever was going to happen. To the sound of hysterical screaming and revving chainsaws I attempted to recede into myself to that spot at the heart of the psyche where the buddhists and hindus tell us all our inner contemptment springs from. And the quest took me down a river curtained by glass vines and geometries from other universes where the circumference is nowhere and the center is everywhere. And there it was. Finally. Peace of mind. Waiting in the distance. And when I came to my peace of mind at last there was a note there, instead and the note read: Speech, motor control, memory it all went out the window. And as my mind fell apart like soggy bits of cake I stopped trying to stay sane and gave in. Dead relatives appeared before me desperately trying to say something but unable to speak I saw myself as an older man then an old man and then a dead man. I desperately looked for an \"I\" or \"me\" on the inside and found none nothing to hold on to, just atoms pretending to be a person. And then finally, I was just a mind floating in space There was no history, no future It had always been like that, I knew I'd only been dreaming of being a human this whole time something I did occasionally to stop from going mad and now, I was alone, again. Back in the real universe, where the only physical constant were unrelenting horror and infinite nothing in all directions. It had no beginning. It had no end. I would spend an eternity like this. -said a voice \"Who's that?\" -I said. \"This is your sub-subconscious, look, just chill out Since we have almost infinite time here we're gonna spend some of it making sure you don't make such a dumb mistake again.\" Plenty of information exists online about how much you should be taking of a certain substance given your height, weight and experience. Don't be a silly sausage and gobble any old amount It's your mind, be smart. If you must insist on taking mind-altering substances make sure it's with people you trust not bellends at a party or something If you're of a skittish or neurotic disposition hallucigens may not be for you Nor may substances like cannabis which in large doses, especially when eaten mimic psychodelics anyway. How long do the effects usually last? Is it nine hours at this dose? Well, then, if you're seven hours in it's only another two hours if you're having a bad time. You will be normal again soon. Yes, the world is suddendly very confusing and even scary but, to be honest, before you took whatever it was the world was equally confusing and scary you just had lots of time to get used to that version. Besides, this one will be gone soon anyway Be cool. Everything's gonna be okay. Have a cup of tea, wait it out. Also, write to your mom, she misses you. And stop eating frozen chips out of the bag you freak! \"Thanks\" -I said- \"that was... whoa that was great! Won't be taking excessive amounts of substances again in a hurry, that's for sure.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So, umm... how much longer... do we have... left here? About an eternity, right?\" \"Yep.\" \"Just uhh... just you and me?\" \"Yesssss.\" \"You uh.... you wanna cuddle, a bit?\" \"What?\" \"Nothing!\" William Tell's awesome overture Thanks for uploading Exurby :3 Also where is my mystery link? I miss my mystery link :( Oh it's already ending?

quarter cup of sugar and mix until light and fluffy this took about three minutes add in four eggs one at a time making sure before adding in the next egg that the previous egg is well combined continue to add all the eggs until the mixture is smooth add in 1 pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla essence and mix until smooth gradually add in the cocoa mixture three tablespoons at a time [Music] mix until a soft dough forms next add in 80 grams of chopped up chocolate i used cadbury spoon batter into a lined baking tin and smooth it out now for the twist i'm going to add in two rolls of roller it's a chocolate with a caramel center place two rolls of rolos on top of the batter bake at 180 degrees celsius for 30 minutes allow to cool then cut into squares [Music] and enjoy [Music] these brownies are so gooey and so chocolatey and the rolos add an extra layer of chocolate flavour hope you try to make this at home [Music] you", "RgNbp3c-LKQ": "welcome to the first episode of mm medical edibles edibles listen don't play dumb he means like pot brownies my name is Jeff Tania Nicol and I'm a culinary nutritionist the way a professional chef no would graduate from Johnson & Wales University today we're gonna make brownies the most popular and common first edible experience you can make your own edibles at home by making butter or oil simply by using some marijuana is not a drug or trim if you can get your hands on it you can make oil with Keith's hash or shatter in terms of dosage it's really personal we'll go to the loony bin together this recipe makes 12 rounds we'll be using half a gram of shatter and butter which will equal 30 milligrams of THC per serving this shatter was tested at eighty six point four percent THC will be using infused oil as well as butter from this recipe my edibles have been recently featured in two Redman videos as well as the enough about me let's get to baking pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees we're gonna start by melting 12 ounces of bittersweet chocolate we also have a stick and a half of butter and a quarter cup of oil which we have already infused with the shadow we'll melt that together over a double boiler on a low simmer this is just a saucepan with about two inches of water and a heatproof bowl and then stir occasionally as it melts and let it completely about once the chocolates melted turn off the stove take it off the heat and set it aside let's get our baking dish ready while the chocolate melts in the oven preheats I've prepared a 9 by 13 inch baking pan I've placed parchment paper on the bottom we're going to cover the bottom as well as the surrounding edges with the infused oil that way the brownie will come out really easy once it's done baking if your supply is limited you don't have to use your infused oil you can absolutely use butter looks good to me now just set aside Oh what I'm so high right now I have no idea you should always clean as you go it always makes the end process that way less cleaning for you and now for the dry ingredients next we're going to sift all the dry ingredients together two cups of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of instant espresso and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt I got papers but bongs all the ingredients the reason why you want to sift your dry ingredients is you want to make sure that you take out any lump it also aerates the flour so we're going to put two cups of all-purpose flour and you can put all the ingredients right in the sifter all together next we're going to grab our measuring spoons then we're going to add a tablespoon of instant expressive coffee really brings out the flavor in your chocolate and half a teaspoon of kosher salt we've set aside the dry ingredients now let's get the wet ingredients ready let's start by cracking some eggs we only need four eggs for this recipe when you crack eggs you really want to crack them one by one that way if there's a bad one you can just throw it out can I offer you a nice egg now again we're using four whole eggs for this recipe now we're going to mix it with two cups of sugar you want to use your paddle attachment for your stand mixer we'll blend the two cups of sugar with the four eggs until they're nice and fluffy then we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract the chocolate mixture and then our dry sifted ingredients if you prefer to use vanilla bean pods you can use one vanilla bean pod scrape the inside and add it to the mixture you mean marijuana and we're going to mix this until it's light and fluffy [Music] that looks nice and light and fluffy now we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract now we're going to add the chocolate mixture chocolate did you say chocolate we're going to combine the rest of the dry ingredients to the batter before we do that I'd like to take the semi-sweet chocolate and just give it a nice toss through the flour that'll prevent the chips from sticking to the bottom right now the batter looks like a thick chocolate mousse and we're going to add these dry ingredients and it's going to definitely thicken up you want to start off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere and then gradually increase the speed and you just want it till it's well combined you don't want to over mix this batter or else it will end up being like a cake I love cake the final step before we put it in the oven we're going to add 6 ounces of semi-sweet morsels [Music] perfect so you just want to place the mixture into your 9 by 13 baking dish remember we put parchment paper on the bottom and again that's going to help us to remove the brownies once they're already cooked and as you can see it's a very thick mixture that's efficient and of course we want to get every little last drop of this that's what she said you want a nice even mixture so you want to spread it out nice and even that's what she said and that looks just about perfect we're going to put these delicious brownies in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes in the meantime give us a thumbs up and subscribe once the timer has gone off you want to check your brownies with a toothpick and as long as it comes out mostly clean your brownies are all set to go you want to let your brownies completely cool on a wire rack then they're ready for garnishing we're going to make a simple caramel sauce for our brownies we're gonna start with 1 cup of sugar J 2 tablespoons of water I got you and then I'm going to squeeze some fresh orange juice which I'm just going to put through the strainer so we don't get any pulp in the sugar and we really only need about a table if our in juice doesn't appease you you can use any citrus you like lemon lime even grapefruit with the wooden spoon to slightly stir you want to leave it on a medium to low heat until it turns a nice dark amber color the caramels turned a nice dark amber color we're going to lower the flame and slowly add half a cup of heavy cream be careful when adding the cream because steam may rise and you may burn yourself it has such a delicious smell and you can really smell that orange in it your last step is to add one tablespoon of butter it's this beautiful dark amber color this is going to be absolutely delicious on top of those brownies remove the caramel sauce from the stovetop and pour it into a tempered glass dish I've gathered a couple of other ingredients a few of my favorites actually some shaved coconut some Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie cereal pecans peanut butter cups and a variety of candy bars literally the combinations are endless chocolate is like wine is like cheese is like coffee you can pretty much pair it with anything I love chocolate my favorite are the Rolo's I think I'll do coconut Rollo's and pecans definitely a good combination with the caramel sauce I'll just give the pecans and the Rolo's a rough chop you always want to be careful when you're cutting next keep your fingers away from the blade it'll tend to move on you I like to use unsweetened coconut because I think this recipe has enough sugar sugar as you can see I'm barely putting the knife to the edge just to loosen it but it should flip out for us fairly nicely another piece of parchment paper on top and just going to flip it and because we put that parchment paper on the bottom of the dish the Browns came out really easily now this does make 12 servings but you can make them smaller if you want you can use the same dough and use a springform pan and I like to make ice cream cakes or ice cream sandwiches these are definitely a nice size brownie not only the fact that they're 30 milligrams thg per serving but the actual brownie itself is a nice cents now look at how deliciously decadent these look and we haven't even topped them so I've cut these upside-down but look how delicious they look flipped over see how fudgy and chocolaty they are they have a nice crisp outside and you can tell the inside is nice and moist just melting I like to drizzle each brownie individually with the camo sauce that way the caramel sauce loses on all four edges a little bit of coconut a little bit of rolos some pecans and then another drizzle this is a great recipe that you can make with either cata butter or can oil it's really up to you and what you have available please leave us a comment and let us know how you like this video also what do you want to see us make next questions likes dislikes leave it in the comments and we'll get back to you here you have it our medical editor with shaved coconut Rollo's and pecans and a caramel drizzle just you could taste all the chocolate and the stickiness from the caramel the crunchiness from the coconut and the pecans it's just delicious tune in next time subscribe and give us a green thumbs up that was

jar indycar to keep so let's get into it [Music] we're gonna be using the mason jar easy r4q the good thing about using the mason jars is what I mean um is the holder [Music] once your teeth this D card I'm you gonna let your mason jar sit for about 30 minutes all right so it's been over 30 minutes so now what we're gonna do is add the coconut oil to the mason jar [Music] now you want to filter

M&Ms so if you can I'll wreck them in buying a pan that come with the dividers like this if you think about this is what's it fake my brother's gonna be equally square so for me I like that but if you don't really care about the shape of it don't they do but if you want your brownness to be kind of kind of similar in sizes I recommend getting a divider buddy we're gonna put this in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes the temperature that I want to be using would be 350 so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right Mikey brownies just now done thank you guys for watching this video don't

if my dog has ever eaten pot brownies or weed brownies or any edibles for that reason or for that matter and yeah it has happened and there's there was two occurrences that happened one was with my dog the other one was with someone else's dog and a cat but that's for another video but this happened two years ago and it wasn't my like pot brownies which was really what pissed me off but um I'm gonna go to the story now so two years ago I had my my um old dog he he passed on and it was really shitty he was for surgery and stuff like that not not of old age but he died because of like he needed a surgery and the surgery was too expensive and it just we couldn't get it to him in time and it was really sad he was my family dog I loved that dog but um anyway what happened was as my friend brought over pot brownies and there was only like seven of them pretty too there was like seven or eight of them and I didn't want to eat any of them but my friend was already on them and no one was home keep mine this was my mom was out of town for a week and no one was home I think my brother would occasionally pop in but he lived separately so everything was pretty much fine it was just me and my friend there for the whole week and I was there to take care of the dogs and you know people I'd like I wasn't completely unattended people would stop by once a day but when they were gone I had the whole night to myself and I had a friend over so the person that came to checking out stopped in and then left and we were left alone with you know these eight pot brownies and my friend was eating them and I didn't want any and he pretty like guys this is what scared me he ate so many of them that I'm pretty sure I can't remember how many he had it like how many he had that day but before he came over I know he already ate two and then he had another two later that night so like that's a lot of [ __ ] pot brownies so I'm gonna send you like Jesus dude like you're like an edibles King and he's like yeah so he left them on I have a dining room and a kitchen and the dining room has a really high table that we didn't think anything would happen and my dog isn't like a what's it called he wouldn't get into anything he would explore and we left the brownies unattended for like literally five minutes no joke we went out of the dining room and went into the basement where I had a foosball table we were playing foosball and he was ripped and I was just [ __ ] kicking his ass in foosball and we came upstairs to see a bag ripped open with pot brownies scattered all over the floor and the thought that immediately crossed our minds was ho my god we are [ __ ] so I run over there and start picking up the brownies when my dogs trying to eat them and I'm like pulling I'm pulling him away I'm like now get him and get him away get him away and my friend has to hold my dog my dog is getting defensive because you're taking his food away and I'm like no you can't eat these he's their chocolate so not to mention they weed and I'm like you're eating this it's so bad for you so we counted all the brownies that were on the ground and my friend already had four of them I think there was about eight so the dog gotten about one and a half to two of them so that's a good amount for a dog his size you know he wasn't like a big dog but he wasn't like a tiny dog he was like an in the middle dog but yeah that was enough to do it so at that point we started giving him water we're trying to get him to [ __ ] out these brownies like we're trying to feed him maybe like the food will help him not get that high and we're just sitting here freaking out and we had to ride it out we didn't want to call the vet because the vet wasn't open it was like we'd have to take him to like an animal hospital and the only Animal Hospital around my house is like an hour away so we had to ride this out and my dog was definitely ripped I every time I would pick him up he would scatter his legs out every time I like I put him back down and he wouldn't stand he would scatter his legs out and just lay down and for a good hour he was just laying down and it took a while to kick in but like he was ripped and I was so scared for him he wasn't shaking or anything like he wasn't in like he wasn't having a bad time and I know this was complete like guys don't get your dogs high please it's not good for them and I don't condone doing this this was a complete accident I believed or not I called my brother and was like now what am I gonna do like the dog ate these he's like oh my god you're a [ __ ] idiot and I'm sitting here like freaking out and someone actually to come over and help us I remember we were trying to like comfort the dog and it went away over time like he was fine he was completely fine he just like after sleeping for so long he woke up was completely fine but we almost took him to the Manimal hospital we freaked out and I I care I care very much about animals I completely think this was wrong and I felt like a douchebag but at least the dog wasn't shaking because I've seen videos online of like dogs that will shake and they'll have a really bad experience and he'll go to the hospital but all my dog did he was just sleepy and he was really just kind of tired he just laid there and like he could stand like he at one point he was standing but he's just a little wobbly that was all but he was okay thank God just letting you guys know the dog was completely okay and everything was fine but ever guys enjoyed the story if he did drop a like if

edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

formal introduction because I do want to incorporate them in my future videos so definitely stay tuned for those this is Toby Toby is actually Tyler's childhood dog he's had him ever since he was a puppy and Toby's 11 now so they kind of grew up together Toby acts like a complete preteen at times of course he'll still be super sweet come up to you want some pets want some cuddles belly rubs but also he definitely just wants to do his own thing wants to be left alone a lot but video on the other hand he just follows me around like he's my tail and I love it your butt is crusty this is Theo he loves to lick he licks he likes right on cue he looks literally anything and everything he can get his tongue on - I got Theo when I was a junior in college he was already one and a half ish when I got him so I kind of missed all of the potty training phase which I'm honestly pretty thankful for Toby just loves tre 80s honestly anything that's not his own kibble is a tre 80s and we you say that word he goes haywire but I love them anyways and they are the best pups I could have ever asked for they're actually not feeling too well today because they had to go to the vet because they've been having a bit of poopie issues lately so I asked Heather to take me to the vet today and that trip was um it was interesting if you follow me on Twitter you know exactly what I'm talking about but I'll post the conversation that me and Tyler had about their vet experience here and yeah but I'm sure y'all are here for the title of this video yes the title of this video unfortunately is true please don't report me I love both of my dogs very very much I would never put them in any danger or any harm it's just I don't even let's just get to the story one day in December during my senior year I witnessed a very very distinctly because we were all at Tyler's house and it was snowing outside and it never snows in Texas we had gone outside played in the snow took pictures in the snow I stuffed vo in one of my jackets and I mean we all had a great time it was wonderful magical snowy amazing right so we all go back inside cuz we're freezing our butts off and we're just sitting downstairs the TV's on everyone's having a great conversation we're just sitting there hanging out and all of a sudden Theo comes running down the stairs I'm sitting on the couch and he jumps on top of me he's like a 15 pound dog and I see brown stuff around his mouth and since he's completely white it stood out like a sore thumb my first thought was Theo just ate some [ __ ] like why so then my brilliant self goes in smells Theo's mouth area and it actually smells like chocolate and so I was like we don't why didn't why do you smell like chocolate we don't have any chocolate I kept on thinking through my head all of the candy bars I bought all the chocolate that we have any possibility of him getting through some chocolate I turned to Tyler and I'm like where the [ __ ] did you get this chocolate like what so we both run upstairs and I think I actually had a mint chocolate dove candy bar but it was shoved way back in one of the desk drawers the door was closed so there's no way he could have gotten to it and so I searched around the room I frantically look everywhere and I'm just like where did you get this chocolate from like I really just I don't understand at that time he lived in a three-story townhome so I ran upstairs to see if either of those doors were open and both of them were shut pretty tight I saw that his roommate across the hall door was kind of cracked open so I'm like oh my god was there some chocolate in his room his roommate actually was at home but his girlfriend was there so she came in with me I look around the room and I don't see any chocolate anywhere I'm just like deal where the [ __ ] did you get chocolate I'm kind of freaking out Tyler's just chill Theo's over here just like standing there staring at us and I'm like what I [Music] see that in the middle of his room there's a piece of ripped up plastic grocery bag in my head I was thinking what weird what I honestly just I didn't know what to think so we walked into the closet and we see that there's just a bunch of torn up grocery bags and Ziploc bags sitting on the floor and I don't even know if at this point I had realized what you had eaten so I take a closer look to see what was in the bag the grocery bag was actually inside of a drawstring bag and it was a pretty heavy-duty it wasn't like one of those ones that you get like at a table in booth it was a pretty thick heavy drawstring bag so I take a closer look and I see that he just ate a bunch of weed brownies I wasn't sure how many he ate because the brownies were individually packaged inside a ziploc bag so Co literally figured out how to open a door untie a drawstring bag two through a Walmart bag and managed to - through Ziploc bags because he smelled the damn brownies because he is such a freakin chocoholic so I go and I count just a block bags and I'm like okay there's one zipper two three and up freakin fourth ziplock bags that Theo - through to eat these damn weed brownies right when I had realized how many brownies he had eaten the first thought that went through my head was okay this is just and this is this is it he's just gonna fall asleep and never wake up and OD off of weed brownies I'm sorry my mind just goes straight to the darkest place I'm just you know I'm just being realistic I'm not trying to sugarcoat it I'm not trying to be hopeful I'm just being freaking realistic because my freaking 15 pound dog just ate four weed brownies after I fully realized what had just happened I kind of just went into panic mode since this wasn't the first time he had eaten chocolate I had already know kind of what to do and how to make him throw up so you're technically not supposed to stick your fingers down a dog's throat like you would to make yourself throw up you're supposed to pour like a little cap full of hydrogen peroxide down his mouth I'm not too sure what the exact measurements are I just know for like a 15 ish count dog it's just the little I mean obviously if your dog is bigger you should give him more and if the dog is smaller give him less but I mean again I'm not a doctor I'm not a vet not a scientist don't quote me on any of this definitely look it up and call your vet just don't take my word for it so we right now serious get the hydrogen peroxide throw him in the bathtub throw one cap full of hydrogen peroxide down his throat he kind of gags a little bit but he's still not throwing up so I'm like okay well if he doesn't throw up he's literally just it's game over it's the end bye bye feel after I want to say like what felt like five minutes but was honestly probably only like two or three minutes I was like okay we got to do this again so I again threw back another shot of hydrogen peroxide down his throat and this time he throws up it was it literally looks like a pile of poo and when he did throw up it wasn't enough to make up for four brownies so I was like this is it this isn't no we got to keep you gotta do it again so I toss back another shot of hydrogen peroxide down his throat a couple seconds later he throws up again this time this pile of poo plus the first pile of throw-up it kind of like equated to about four brownies but he kind of just stood there kind of gagged some more and threw up again but this time it was it wasn't as much brownie it was more just ah cracy so after the third time he threw up I call my bed because that wasn't my first instinct of course this is that like 11 o'clock p.m. I'm like hey my dog just ate four weed brownies um what should I do she asked me if he had thrown up yet and I told her yeah I made him throw up hydrogen peroxide she was like okay awesome and honestly she just told me to monitor him and make sure he's okay make sure he eats a little basically carb load his ass and so I gave him some rice cuz they didn't want to eat his kibble I gave him some rice and water and like a drop of sesame oil after he ate that up he was still kind of pretty normal which I thought to be kind of weird I was like okay maybe we just doesn't affect dogs I was wrong after he ate a couple minute I want to say like 10-15 minutes later he's just sitting there so still not moving staring at us in the middle of the room and I'm just like you're literally such a freaky weirdo what are you doing he's just sitting there and all of a sudden he just goes he starts swaying and then I'm like oh my god I try to go and comfort him and then he just starts sprinting around the room darting in circles like nobody's freaking business and then he stops he starts swinging again and then I go and try and pet him patients darting him around the room in like full speed 90 miles per hour and then he stops and he starts swinging again and then I'm like this dog is if he's not dying from the weed that he's gonna hit his head on something and he's just gonna that's it this is it tonight's the night that our IP Theo is dead and after like 30 minutes of him I asked Tyler to take him outside to go potty and he just sprinted everywhere the whole time I mean the next morning he was okay so he turned out I mean I don't know it's whatever but yeah I definitely wouldn't recommend we Brodie's for dogs I don't know it was just very traumatizing is what it was and in the midst of like me panicking Tyler doing whatever Toby just walks in to the bathroom and just starts eating you know he just starts eating when we're just panicking Theo's highest [ __ ] so that's Toby and deal for you Tyler claims it's straw eating but I don't know so yeah I think that's gonna be it for today's video if you like this video definitely give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel for future videos I of course always I very very much appreciate it and yeah I'll see you

people thought that I was going to start smoking weed like left and right no it's not the case just wanted to get that out of the way cuz some people were like oh no Austin you're gonna change and not upload and get lazy and smoke a bunch of pot and then fall off and that's not the case even if I was smoking every day I'd still be doing this because it's my hobby and I love it and I enjoy it and I love all of you and I wouldn't just ditch on you guys for no reason so now that's all the way so first time trying edibles or first time eating edibles or some [ __ ] like that I don't know what I'm gonna name this but yeah it's about edibles you guys I know what ed Abele's are they are you know weed brownies weed cookies just everything with food that you love mixed with weed so it's a pretty win-win situation um a lot of people describe the high is very different usually when you smoke weed you get like a head high and then when you eat edibles you get like a body high now um my experience with edibles were pretty weird I um I didn't really feel everyone says that you feel like a body high I didn't feel really like a body high it was like a weird high but I'm gonna get into the story now that way you can really get into my persona so um get into my view of it so I took edibles like literally it was funny because at the time I took edibles was like the third week I started smoking weed so I was pretty young and um you know I'm really not I was kind of afraid to try out of bowls just funny and I remember I had this one kid that I used to go to school with he used to come into school all the time with weed brownies and he used to sell them in school and I was like what like why like who sells edibles in school that's the the worst thing you could do like why would you do that so I met this kid in school he was a good friend of like a bunch of my friends knew this kid and um we called him the Weed Man because he used to just bring weed and sell it in school and I know it's not good but yeah so he used to just go into the bathroom every morning I used to see it I'd come into school and I'd look in the bathroom door and he'd always be in there selling drugs to people so uh yeah it really proves um don't follow in this kid's footsteps cuz he'll end up like he did cuz right now he's locked up he's in jail so um so I met this kid and he always had edibles on him and it like the more and more I saw this kid selling edibles to my friends made me want to try it even more so one day I was scared and he asked me he was actually with my friends at the lunch table and he just straight up asked me yo Austin would you want to like buy one off me and I was like sure why not so we go into this little like handicapped one door bathroom and he locks the door and he only had like one brownie I think it wasn't it was a pop brownie and it wasn't even like I don't think it was even made with like good [ __ ] I think he liked the cannabutter that he made I think is that how you do it I know you I've never even made an edible before I I've been with my friends while they make them but I've never actually made an edible so he just gave me this pot brownie I knew nothing about edibles at the time I barely even know anything about weed at the time so he gives me this pot brownie and um he's like gee oh just give me like 15 bucks and I'll give it to you I was like all right so you having 15 bucks he probably ripped me off I don't even care it was worth it so we proceeded out of the bathroom he goes first I wait like 10 minutes and then I go out after him and I have it in this little like baggie it was kids funny it was kind of broken up it was like half broken and it was in this baggie you know it's like [ __ ] it it's not even about the taste they're like how it looks it's just gonna get me to where I need to go and that is high so I leave ten minutes after he does and we're in the I'm in the hallway at this point going back up to the cafeteria now this is lunchtime so we have like three more hours of the day now when you take an edible I think it takes like 40 minutes to kick in depending on your metabolism I know I have a very quick metabolism so it kicked in a lot faster than I thought I would so um I was originally planning to do this at home like a week from when I got it which is a horrible idea it'll rot and be disgusting but we were in school and my one friend had one too because that's where I met the we were at lunch and my friend just got back from buying one and he asked me if I wanted one so my friend he had pot brownie too and we were just like hmm we were sitting there looking at each other and he was just like yo I was like what he's like do you wanna you wanna go take this with me I was like you're gonna do it in school he's like yeah I mean we got one more class after this and it's Jim and we don't even do anything so why not and I was like I don't know man he's like come on dude just let's just do it I was like III don't think so Mays like but what if you did I was like what if I did he's like we'd have a lot of fun and I was just like all right man you know what [ __ ] it you got me so keep in mind this is when I didn't give a [ __ ] about school this is when I was like going more towards going into high school so I didn't really have to try that hard which is a horrible way to look at school but you know do good but I go into the same bathroom that I actually bought the pot brownie and with my friend and um we both took one bite of our brownies and I like I said mine was kind of in half but he was laughing at me because it was so deformed looking so he ate his really fast he had it down in like literally ten seconds and I'm just sitting there chewing on it like oh this tastes really weird because it tasted like brownie but at the same time it almost had like a shitty dark chocolate taste to it it was really weird tasting and they're not supposed they're not really supposed to taste that good but especially if you hom make them and you've never made a brownie before but um they can actually taste really good I've had edibles I think I don't know how many times I've actually had edibles quite a few times but a few of those times they've tasted really really good so um this was just my first time so it tasted kind of like a shittiest so I got the brownie down in like five minutes I ate the first half and then I had the second half and um it was kind of hard to get down like I said it tasted like really nasty dark chocolate at first but um after it was down me and my friend we were just chilling in the bathroom cracking jokes I don't know we were waiting to go out because we heard someone outside the door and then he went out first again because you know they have cameras at my school we don't wanna look suspicious even though you could already see us both walking in there there was really no point trying to not look suspicious we already looked really [ __ ] suspicious so so he walks out of the bathroom I walk out too after like five minutes of waiting and at this point we go into gym so we're in gym and depending on your we can go it could take an hour to kick in sometimes pot brownies are very potent and they take a little bit to kick in so when you take an audible you got to know that it will take time to kick into your system it could take like it like literally it could be up to an hour so when you're taken out of oil be patient so um by the way guys if any of you ever take edibles just know in your head no one's really no one ever really died from cannabis so if you eat this and have a bad time you're not gonna die so relax okay that's what I tell myself so like I said I wasn't nervous when I took this but when I took it I just kept thinking that I'm like no one's ever died from weed you can't die from weed the worst thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna be too potent and I'm gonna be a little like on my ass and I'm gonna be like too high so after like 40 minutes since I have such a light like heavy like quick metabolism it was in my system like 40 minutes it kicked in now on it was very potent I didn't want to move I was sitting on the bleachers and gym and I was sitting there with my friend and his hit him like 20 minutes after mine had him because he's a little bit more heavyweight than me and actually don't even know if weight has anything to do with it I've never really looked into that but I thought if you were just like a more lightweight person it would hit you quicker so it hit me really fast I'd hit him like 10 15 maybe 20 minutes later I can't remember cuz time was kind of loopy with me when I smoked her eat an edible like time just slows down so I don't know what's going on it feels like an hour when really it's been like five minutes so I'm singing on the bleachers everyone's playing at floor hockey and like the gym teachers bitching at me because I'm not going in to play and he looked at me why won't you play I'm like because I don't [ __ ] want to because he's a nice guy we're friends but I can like he lets me swear and stuff I'm like cuz I don't [ __ ] want to it he's like alright fine so he he marked me absent for the day technically because I wasn't playing which is a douchebag movie to do and you know I just kind of sat in gym I was super on my ass like I said I didn't want to move it was a really heavy high it was potent as [ __ ] like it was in my head and it felt like I was in my body so the high was just everywhere I still had that feeling or if I was shutting my eyes it felt like I was falling and my stomach actually kind of hurt after like 30 minutes of being high like I was really on my ass and I didn't want to move and I was like uh but I really like started get stomach pains and that kind of sucked I to go to the bathroom which was so [ __ ] bad I did like I said I said the worst cramp I've probably ever gotten in my life but um you know it lasted quite a lot like I can't remember how long I actually lasted it was like there was a few hours I think but it was it was really crazy cuz I remember the bus ride home I was like just sitting there like uh because Jim was my last class of the day since I took it at the end of lunch so um it was a pretty crazy experience and I can't remember too much after getting home I think after I got home I just played xbox like black ops 2 or something and yeah I just played some Call of Duty and relaxed it was really really funny I don't know if my friend was really funny he was like he was making me laugh I don't know when we were sitting on the bleachers he just kept cracking jokes and being funny cuz we were the only two sitting on the bleachers so we just got to talk the whole class but um yeah that's basically my experience with edibles let me know in the comments below what your experience is with them are and if you've ever taken it out of bull or you know pot brownie so yeah this has been Austin FFA or Luna I hope you guys enjoyed the story I'll see you guys tomorrow happy Super Bowl Sunday peace", "6_ydj_Xi6g0": "I wanna be a good guy, and that should be\nyour first clue that I'm a bad guy. Good guys don't say that.\nThey're just that. So the fact that I'm striving\nfor something that I'm not, that, you know...\nis a good sign? It's a good... It's a great sign, right? [cheers and applause]\nYeah. That's actually\nmy wife's handwriting. Um, so...when I asked her\nto do that, what I was really just--\nIt's basically her signing off\non me being a good guy without her knowing it. She was like, \"Oh, I get to\nwrite something in neon?\" I'm like, \"Well, I just kinda\nwanna make sure we remember what you wrote.\" But I do,\nI wanna be a good guy. And the thing about\nbeing a good guy is you can't just gather\nyour friends up and say, \"Hey, guys,\nI'm gonna do a 180. \"Thanks for coming out\nto Denny's. \"I just wanted to... \"open it up with that,\nand, um, \"if you guys could just mention\nthat to everybody forever, I'd appreciate it.\" You can't do it that way. What you do is you make\ngood decisions over time, and you hope that people\nnotice. And they think,\nyou know what, Nick's... he used to not pick me up\nfrom the airport because he told me\nI wasn't an adult because I should just\nfigure rides out... but this time,\nhe almost did. And that's what being\na good person is, being there for your\nfriends and family, and it just is choices over time\nto make you a better person. So the first decision\nthat I made to be a good guy is I decided\nto quit smoking marijuana. Illegally. And I got my pot card. [crowd cheering]\nBecause--yeah. Well, I live in California\nright now where, you know, you still\nhave to lie to doctors. And the thing about it is\nthey say it's so easy. You go in to the doctor\nand you say, \"My back hurts,\" or \"I've got anxiety,\" and they\njust want you to smoke weed. And so I went in to a doctor\nand said, \"I've got anxiety that\nsomeday my back might hurt.\" And he said, \"Dude,\nthat's a serious issue. \"Lotta people your age\nare dealing with that right now. Let's cut that out\nbefore it starts.\" And he gave me a weed card. Because I think\nscumbags go to drug dealers, but good guys\nlie to doctors. And so there I am... I've got my weed card. The feeling of having\nyour weed card-- I just ran out into\nthe streets of L.A. like, where do we--Where are we?\nWhere are we going? And there's weed stores\neverywhere. And I picked one, and I hoped\nit was the right one, and I go in,\nand it was because.... there was weed there. And if you've never been\nin to a weed store, the best way to describe it is that it's like every store\nyou've ever been in but all weed, right? And so they've got everything.\nThey got, like, weed water, weed sodas, trail mix,\nlip balm, lotions. And they even just have\nthis little area in the corner where they just have weed. Like what our forefathers\nused to smoke. And I'm an old-fashioned guy.\nI like to smoke weed. I to smoke-a da weed. It is a saying\nthat I have coined. So I bought some weed to smoke\nand I said, \"Thank you so much,\" and I turned to walk out and\nit just--it didn't feel real. I just bought drugs, and I was\nable to walk outside. And I turned to walk out,\nand with drugs in one hand and a hand on a doorknob\nto freedom, from over my shoulder\nI hear, \"Oh, Mr. Thune, one more thing.\" And that's the moment\nthat you realize it's been a six-year sting\noperation focused on me. And there's eight cops\nout in a van like, \"I didn't think\nhe'd fuckin' do it! \"We're goin' home! Jason, you're gonna meet\nyour daughter!\" And I turn around just like,\njust where's the handcuffs? Just break 'em out.\nAnd she doesn't have handcuffs. She's actually holding\na weed brownie. And she says, \"Mr. Thune, I\nknow it's your first time here, \"and...it's a cutthroat\nbusiness out there. \"We're glad you chose us and we\nhope you keep coming back, \"and to show our gratitude...\n[audience whooping] here's a free weed brownie.\" And she handed me\na weed brownie that was about the size\nof a VHS tape. And I know this is streaming\nand there's younger audiences. Um...\n[laughter, applause] It's like-- It's like four Apple TVs. Same amount of content. And I'm holding\nthe weed brownie and I'm looking at it,\nand I'm gonna be honest-- I don't like to eat\nweed brownies because... I don't like to feel\nlike I'm dying all the time. But we all learned\nin elementary school: You never say no to drugs! You accept the drug.\nYou either learn to like it, or you give it to your best\nfriend on his wedding day. And so I accepted the weed\nbrownie and I said, \"Thank you so much.\nThank you. Someday.\"\nAnd I turned to walk out, and as I turned to walk out and\nI had my hand on the door again, She said, \"Oh, wait, \"Mr. Thune. I almost forgot.\nOne more thing.\" And that's the moment\nyou realize that they just planted\nmore drugs on me. The guys in the van are like,\n\"I didn't think he'd do that! \"Offer him coke. \"See what he says. Tell him there's hookers\nin the back.\" And I turn around just like,\n\"Just call my wife. Tell her it's over.\nJust take me away.\" And she says, \"What I almost\nforgot to tell you is... Make sure and only\neat an eighth of it.\" And I was like,\n\"An eighth of it?\" She was like, \"Um... \"I mean, yeah, basically\nwhat you wanna do... \"I mean, okay, what you wanna do\nis you wanna-- \"first off, you just wanna\nbreak it up into halfs. \"And then what you're\ngonna wanna do is, uh, \"you wanna break\nboth those up into halfs. And then at that point, you--\"\nI was like, \"Oh, no, no, no! \"I know fractions.\nOh....God, I... \"I am so sorry\nI didn't stop you. \"I didn't know you were\ndefining fractions. \"I was just curious as to how\nyou almost forgot to tell me \"that I might die. \"But thank you so much. Thank you.\nSomeday.\" And I took the weed brownie,\nand I took it home. And when I got home, I put\nthe weed brownie in a backpack. And, you guys,\nthat's not me bragging. We've all got backpacks,\nand I'm not-- I'm not trying to act like\nI'm better than you. \"Oh, the big guy who moved\nto L.A. has backpacks now!\" I just have a backpack\nthat I'll keep drugs in every now and again. And I put it in there\nand I thought, \"Someday.\" And then I moved on\nwith my life. And then later that night...\n[laughter] Later that night,\nI took all the weed that I had bought\njust to smoke, and I took it over\nto a friend's house. And me and him smoked all of\nthat weed in his backyard like responsible 36-year-old men do on a Tuesday\nevery now and again. We were playing pinball\nin his backyard. He has a pinball machine\nback there, just out... outside. Because in California,\nyou can just put stuff outside. And it's so close\nto you guys. What if you could\nput your stuff outside? It's an interesting sell\nfor California. They're all moving up here. You guys can put your stuff\noutside down there! Think about it. So we're out there\nplaying pinball, and then I had that moment\naround midnight, that moment where your heart\nsinks into your stomach and you just--You're--\nOh, my-- My phone! I put my phone over on a bench\nabout two hours ago, and for two hours,\nI'd just been sitting there living my fucking life. And you see your phone\nand it's just like, oh, my God, what happened?\nWhat--What's going on? And there it is--I've missed\nfive phone calls from my wife. [sighs]\nAnd it just-- It didn't feel that important. So I hop back on to\nthe pinball machine... and I keep playing pinball, and then I hear the sixth\nphone call coming in. And, you guys, if you know me,\nif you know me, you know that I get\nthe sixth phone call every fucking time.\nThat's a guarantee. So I pick up the phone\nand before I can say a word, it's Suzanne on the other end\njust screaming, \"What the fuck\nwas in your backpack? What the fuck\ndid you put in that backpack?\" And when you're as high as I am\nand somebody calls you and they're angrily yelling\nabout backpacks in a very accusatory manner, in my stoned brain,\nall I could hear was her questioning\nmy backpack knowledge. All I could hear was, \"You don't\nknow shit about backpacks! You're not the man\nI married!\" And I'm just like,\n\"Whoa... \"Suzanne! \"You called the wrong guy! \"You know I know about\nbackpacks! \"And you used to have\na JanSport back when we met \"when you were fuckin' real... Where's that JanSport at,\nSuzanne?\" And then it just gets\nreal quiet, and my friend Cameron's\nin the corner just like... \"Yeah, dude...yeah! Tell Suzanne hey for me,\ntoo.\" And then this is the moment\nwhen everything is like, wait,\nwhat are we yelling about? What's happening right now? W--is this Suzanne--\nlike... lotta thoughts\ngoin' through my head. [exhales]\nAnd then in that moment... Ohh...Suzanne said, in the most calm manner, \"Whatever was in your backpack, Mikey ate.\" Mikey's our 36-pound\nFrench bulldog. - Oh! - I am Mikey's 185-pound owner. 90. 190. I'm 6'4\". Mikey's like... dog height. I was supposed to eat\nan eighth of it... Mikey ate\nthe whole goddamn thing. Because Mikey likey. And I told him, \"You go hard,\nbuddy, every time.\" And as all of that\nwas processing in my head, my wife, who is living the worst\nlife with the worst husband, just said,\n\"Just get the fuck home,\" and she hung up,\nand I just sprung into action. I looked at my friend\nand I said nothing, and I ran to my car. And when I got to my car, I ran\nback into my friend's house, and he helped me find my car\nkeys for about ten minutes. Found my car keys.\nRan back out to the car. Got in the car, drove home. And I did not listen\nto any music on that drive home because I didn't deserve it. Because the new,\nresponsible Nick doesn't just flip on tunes\nwhen he's in trouble. He thinks about what he did. And he might not...be able\nto figure out the stereo at that moment. So I drove home,\nand when I got home, I pulled into our driveway. And the best way to describe\nour driveway is it's curved, so as you pull in at night, your headlights wipe the house,\nright? Just like...shhhuuuu! And there,\nat the end of the wipe, was the end of the driveway\nwhere my wife's car was parked. And for that moment,\nfor just...[snaps] I could see her face... just...\n[snaps] And the only way\nto describe the look... that was on her face... is... divorce. Parked my car, got out,\nran around, and there's Mikey just sprawled\nout in the backseat of her car. And the only way to describe\nhow high Mikey was is Burning Man high. He's like a dog that's been\nstuck at a hippie festival in the Nevada desert\nfor 14 days, and he just needs\na ride home. And he's not even sure\nhe's a dog anymore. And he's wearing pants. Did Mikey buy pants?\nDid he-- Did he have money at some point?\nThese are kind of... Turns out,\nhe couldn't hold his pee in, so she just put my favorite\npair of pants on him. That were not at the top\nof the drawer. She fucking dug those out... which I deserved. So I hop in the backseat\nwith Mikey, 'cause there's no way\nI'm gonna sit up front with an angry pregnant lady. audience: Oh! I didn't even mention\nshe's pregnant. [laughter]\n- Oh! - Edit that out. Let's just say she's sober. I think it's better for\nthe story--for me. So I hop in the backseat\nwith Mikey. We got a real angry\nsober lady up front, and she backs outta\nthe driveway and starts driving to the vet\nin a way that is exciting. It's like,\nthis is the woman I married! You drive like this forever! This is exciting! And I'm in the backseat,\nand all of a sudden it feels like a cool stoner\nbuddy comedy adventure. Like I'm James Franco\nand he's Seth Rogen and... who knows what's gonna happen? We know Judd Apatow's\nonboard. And we are driving,\nand halfway to the vet, she realizes that I am as high\nas the dog is. And it was subtle. It was just...\nI had my head out the window. Now... I married I smart woman, because most simpletons\nwould just roll the window up. But it's actually\na two-step process for a genius. She locked the windows... and then rolled it up. Caught a lotta chin,\ngood amount of hair. And then she said--\nas the window was up and I was sitting back there\nslightly confused-- She said, \"Nick,\nI just wanna know... \"I just have a question. \"I just wanna know\nif this is you. \"Is this who you are? \"Is this the man I married... \"who's gonna be a father,\nwho's a dog owner, my husband.\nIs this who you are?\" [exhales]\nOhh... And it's just like, \"You're fucking bumming me out\nright now, like...I am really stoned.\" And anybody that's ever\nsmoked weed before, you know that you could go\ndown two paths right there, the darkest path ever,\nor wanna be better. And I wanted to be better.\nSo we got to the vet, and I grabbed Mikey\nand I ran like it was \"Boyz N The Hood\"\nand my best friend's been shot. I get to the front door\nof a 24-hour vet and I kick it open, and me and my stoned dog\nenter extremely loudly into a very quiet\nand somber waiting room... to a 24-hour vet. People are sitting\nin this waiting room whose animals\nare currently dying... - Aw...\n- And Mikey is living for the first time! [audience cheering] And what do you do? What do you do\nin that situation? And I'll tell you what you do is you fill out a shitload\nof paperwork. And it's questions like\nwhat's your dog's name? And honestly... who fuckin' cares? His name's dog. Fix dog. Dog. What's his birthday?\nHa oh... Who wrote this? I don't know\nAbraham Lincoln's birthday! You think I know\nthis turd's birthday? One of them freed slaves. The other one eats human shit\nwhenever he has an opportunity. Happened twice.\nWorst two days of my life. I don't know his birthday. So I just put my dad.\nJust May 17, 1950. He's an old dog.\nHe's doing great. But if there's anything\nyou're gonna say about us as dog owners...\nhe's doin' pretty good. Next question.\nWhat's your name? Ha. Okay. All right. I guess I'll\ntake this one left-handed. Nick Thune threw the pen.\nWent for a high five. Suzanne didn't care. And then they take us back\nto the room. So this assistant walks us back,\nand they put us in a small room. Suzanne sits back\nin the corner. Lotta anger, um... Real quiet. I'm in the middle\nof the room holding Mikey. Still have a pretty good\nbuzz goin'. And that's the moment that\nthe vet walks into the room. And this is the order\nin which it happens. She's bouncing\nfrom room to room. Animals are dying everywhere.\nShe's flipping through paper-- She doesn't have time to look at\npaperwork before she comes in. She comes in the room\njust buried in the paperwork, and she goes,\n[laughs] \"Oh, my God! Nick Thune.\" Looks up, realizes the tension. \"Oh, sorry.\nI just--I saw your name. \"I'm a big fan of your comedy. Um...\" [audience whooping] \"This is crazy! \"Uh...anyway. \"So... What's going on with Dog?\" Ohh! Two horrible things\njust happened. One--Suzanne just realized I wrote down our dog's name\nas dog. Two--this person likes me,\nactually thinks I'm a good guy. Suzanne's in the corner\njust like, \"What... What is my life?\" The vet's looking at me\nkinda like kinda getting it like, \"You fucking rascal.\" But the vet's a pro.\nShe pushes through it. She goes, \"Okay, well,\nhow much weed did he eat?\" And I was like, \"I'll ta-- \"I'm probably the only one\nthat knows that. Standard VHS size...\nbrownie?\" And then she said,\n\"Did he eat the whole thing?\" And that's when I said,\n\"Knowing him... he probably put a little\naside for later.\" To which she laughed out loud at\nbecause she should have because she's a fan and I gave her\nevery...thing she wanted! [cheers and applause] That was some off-duty,\npro bono, off-the-clock shit! Just like, oh, you like\nmy stuff? There ya go, babe. That one's for you. And she's looking at me\nlike you're the fuckin' best! And I'm lookin' at her like, if this doesn't work out...\nyou and me forever! And in that moment, Suzanne takes the car keys\nout of her purse and throws them across the room, and they hit me\nin the side of the head and she says,\n\"Go wait in the fucking car.\" Freeze frame.\nThat's it. That's the 25-minute story\nI'm opening my special with. Think about it. Think about it\nfor just a second, though. What just happened? What just\nhappened? And if you look at that moment\nfor just a second, just that whole moment, that freeze frame,\nand think who's in the room? Wait--who do we got? We got Nick. We've got...a fan, right? We've got... not a fan. For good reasons. What happened there? And I think if you ask\nmost people, they'll say, \"Well, you're an\nasshole, and she was angry.\" But...if you surround\nyourself with yes people... what I think\nreally happened there is she was basically saying,\n\"Hey, big guy, \"you're fucking\nkilling it in here. \"This is why I married you!\nGet outside, have a cigarette. \"I'm gonna handle\nall this adult bullshit. \"They're probably gonna\nkeep Mikey overnight. \"We can go home...\nenjoy ourselves without this creep\nwatching us, for once.\" So anyway,\nMikey got sober two days later. And he's been sober\nabout a year now, and we are just... so proud of him. [cheers and applause]", "ibRpp_Hei5k": "let's just get into Ted real quick okay yesterday we filmed the podcast with Ted and then Ted from lunch clubs heads from lunch later Ted nificent he he basically was signing a bunch of posters nificent it's not in division sniffing you get real mad at you anyways yeah Ted was signing a bunch of posters upstairs for you twos it was something with their deal and it actually put a bunch of signatures down so he's doing that and he gets a little hungry and what does he see on the bench behind him a nerds row just a cheeky nerd rope and of course nerd rope sir very rare pay pays and when you see one you're like oh I had when I was a kid they're [ __ ] amazing but what he didn't think about is the fact that everything in misfits house is poisoned well just look the thing is like there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse I'm so glad the first misfits house wasn't there no LA cuz that so would have happened to me multiple times died accidental highs were cut out for for LA guys 100% why I think I could make the best content here I want to make I are ell stuff well Toby's very into like lifestyle and fashion content posted so many creators to collab with yeah he's so cute in person yeah he's actually straight up like a beauty has a beautiful face like his face is uh nayana Klee like perfect spock done household was oh he was spent my night yeah yeah I so he's a [ __ ] he felt like an inch too tall okay very interesting yes but Ted Ted eats this nerd rope and then looks at the packaging him well no I sure would happened was he was he ate it and he was gonna eat another one yeah he was going to eat a second and the coop was like whoa he's like what are you doing that Sweden goes what are you kidding I just had one I just had ho ho ho what a hit movie look at it and they go oh that's like 60 milligrams she's like 60 no holy [ __ ] and then look at his 400 400 why make dinner why would they make a nerds rope $400 surely they got it from an illegal dispensary we get we get we buy from illegal dispensary it's one that isn't legal I know because obviously a dispensary doesn't again I have to be legal well it's illegal in that it's it doesn't really abide by the restrictions it sells like you know in in most of the actual like madmen or cookies on Melrose or any of those [ __ ] places it's like you can only get a hundred milligrams max and any edible and Brian and Manuel and all those guys in our team they're like that's not enough we need a thousand just for fun ya know so the interesting thing about like weed here is that there's so many different places that they're like they're like ratings for the weed like 400 milligrams all that it's not really consistent cuz I remember the first time Mayson IRA now la I don't even smoke weed I don't like weed but I had hundreds of milligrams available and I was totally fine but but now here these guys will have like you know 50 milligrams and be pretty decently high 50 to 60 is a lot yeah I'll take like maybe seventy-five to a hundred four flights where I want to dock myself out Mason and I streamed in LA that time I was to be fair I was pretty high but like I wasn't like I'm dying yeah you were freaking I had that was hundreds hundreds of milligrams yeah like there we had drinks and stuff that would be like 50 years pictures yeah there's we drink yeah yeah just weed everything you know this where do you start I wasn't oh geez what nothing this is a big big game ourselves yeah anyway back to the routine I'm very very fascinated by this routine you keep breaking it up we'll talk about drugs Japan so sick of hearing about drugs what they want to know is what pokey main doesn't a day okay maybe her simps one and I don't know I'm kind of care kind of hope the sims are watching shout out guys what do you what do you think of that [ __ ] [Music]", "W7Un2J1_My8": "[Music] it's mad at Rafal studios welcome to can of a six today we're doing an in-depth tutorial on how to make rosin chip cannabutter and then we're making danca forest Rowdies this episode is sponsored by the wizard puff online head shop you can save money with the code rough house on the tart press rosin press and many other really cool cannabis related products at wizard puff calm now let's get started with the first part of the video which is to make our rosin ship Kennebec for that you want to need rosin chips you're gonna need some butter I use unsalted butter you need an emulsifier such as sunflower or soy liquid lecithin and that is optional the amount of cannabis Ross and chips you need is you kind of Center you need three to four times the amount of rosin chips that you would regular cannabis so for a cup I'm using 66 grams which is a little over two ounces which would equal to a little over 1/2 ounce of regular cannabis okay so let's get started the first step is going to be to decarboxylate and some my previous videos I didn't decarboxylate the cannabis chips but I found out through some testing with my tea check that I do need to decarboxylate it will help so we're going to go ahead and decarboxylate crumble that up in an oven safe dish put some foil on it to keep down the smell and then we're going to put that in the oven to decarboxylate it it takes about the same amount of time as it what if it was on decarboxylated or unpressed cannabis so we're going to do it for 25 minutes 250 degrees Fahrenheit that gives us enough time to clarify our butter now I'm going to do all the steps today to make as good a can of butter as I can so one part of that is to clarify your butter that's and we're moving on the milk solids and so we will have a more pure butter oil that's remaining that butter oil will make it more bioavailable by concentrating the oil instead of having the milk solids still contain in there so it'll also help it be more shelf stable by removing the milk solids which will make it ruin quicker if you left it out on the counter so those the reasons that we clarify herb butter you heat that over medium medium-high heat until it foams and you take that skim and skim the white foam off and then if you get to the point of heat where it starts making the little burnt pieces on the bottom go ahead and cut your heat off you don't want to scorch your butter and if you get it a little brown it's okay it'll have a nice nutty taste but don't burn your butter okay and then after that you should have your cannabis decarboxylated your butter is clarified and we're going to do a new step here that I don't usually do and this is colored emulsifying step so what I'm doing is I'm taking the cannabis and putting in the hopper of a food processor while it's still hot or still warm at least from the oven from the clarification the butter and that's going to help soften up these rosin chips that are compressed and really hard and I've also added in my soy or this is sunflower lecithin which is an emulsifier that's going to help homogenized all these items together so you see I gave you several pulses there with a food processor that's going to grind up those rows and chips and help us extract out that remaining cannabis that's lodged inside of those pressed chips and I've given it about 15-20 seconds total just pulse it a few times there and you can see what what's happened is now those rosin chips that were you know thick and I'll press together have loosened up temperature and both that and the pulsing it have really loosened it and started the infusion process already but we haven't infused it yet so we're still going to use the heat infusion process so I'll put that back into the oven safe dish I've used the same piece of foil and I put it back in the oven 250 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours for infusion alright so we're just about finished with our can of butter here this is some really really dark and dank can of butter because we're using four times the amount of cannabis that we would usually use of course it's going to be a lot darker in color and you can see that really shows through a lot there alright so we're going to now strain out the cannabis and we're using our fine mesh strainer you're just going to strain it through and I'm using the back end of a silicon paddle there just to press and press and let it sit and let the all the oil press through and run through there because you don't want to leave anything in there you're going to lose some and you saw I started with three sticks of butter but I'm going to end up with one cup so I actually always count on losing a third amount of my butter between the clarifying it and all that and what's left in there and then what you can do with the cannabis let's go over put it in your compost and just put that back into the ground where it came from [Music] and now we'll continue on with the dank forest brownies recipe for that you need a half a cup of canned butter we just made a large chocolate brownie mix yes a store-bought mix 2 eggs 3 tablespoons of water 12 ounces of coconut pecan icing and some chopped pecans about a cups of chopped pecans okay the first step is going to be a 10 ml to measure out your butter now if you're using a store-bought mix I am recommending it here go ahead and measure out the amount that it says in your recipe it probably say to use oil vegetable oil just replace that with this butter oil that we made okay you might say 1/3 cup my say 2/3 mine's a half a cup alright so we're going to have that measured out and if you already had your can of butter or frozen or you know hardened up or stored up you'd want to you know put it in some dish of hot water till they got liquefied to measure it out properly ok when our leftover counted butter I'm going to store that back in refrigerator and a hair tie container and there I'm using this supreme triple Chunk brownie mix it's so good and I'm using the large size to make a family pan but I'm not going to make a family pan we're making big thick brownies okay and you're going to use the store or in the box recipes it's a mine called for water eggs and then the oils which I use the butter ok and then just mix it up as per the directions really simple to make brownies you just mix all the ingredients together and just mix it mix until you have a nice creamy consistency just like that everything mixed in together [Music] ok I'm using a 9 by time 9 by 9 pan for this recipe that's what I find to be perfect so if you use that same mix and the same size it should work out like this but otherwise follow the instructions for your recipe as far as cooking it goes ok for mine of baking that at 350 Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes and this is just sort of a pro tip here if you're gonna toast your nuts and I highly recommend it I mean if you're gonna put the nuts on there just toast them do it tastes great and it's a perfect to use the oven that's already on so while your brownies are cooking go ahead and toast your nuts in there to chop and toast them alright but then after your brownies are done you know how to check that by putting the little the toothpick in there when it comes out clean your brownies are done you're gonna go ahead and let that cool completely before you ice it so it it's the hardest part letting that cool and I'm using this Betty Crocker pecan coconut icing because I'm making like sort of like a black forest cake that flavor but with the the dang brownie so that's the dank forest brownies and so just loaded up with that coconut icing just just smear it all over I mean heavier like and a gross amount almost but just just load it up and then those nuts that we toasted earlier are cooled off and so you can press them down into that icing so that they don't fall off and kind of make it less later mess later it's just kind of use your palm a little bit wet your palm and just press them down into that it would be perfect and then you're done you're ready to enjoy these bad boys and these are so delicious you just won't believe how much that sweetness and that big thick icing on top and those toasted nuts adds to it you'll love these also be sure to check out wizard puffs calm they're a big-time sponsor of us we love them used to co roughhouse to

do this is cuz I gotta get rid of it because my room is startin is smell suspicious I'm gonna eat this it's a brownie I have a plan I think it's gonna be really fun my friend told me not to eat the whole thing but I'm gonna eat the whole thing because I always overestimate my abilities it's good because otherwise you'll never know like how far you can go it's bad because if you go too far you're [ __ ] it's not a big deal or anything curious as to how I would act if I were to eat this whole thing so I'm gonna eat that then I come back within like an hour or so we're just gonna kind of chill and I'm gonna read like 3,000 questions about me and I'm gonna just go like this pick a random page put my finger on a freaking random one and read what is your preferred playing piece and monopoly

like five times like five times oh my god okay now let's get to the first page of the book do you ever feel blue and if so what triggers it um yeah I feel blue sometimes I'm a human what triggers it I

feelings for once in my life what was I talking about you're like I'm lagging let me do some jumping jacks oh man I'm gonna send this video to someone I know before the world sees it just cuz I want them to be the first to see it make sure I have enough yeah I do let's check in my battery and how much space I have on my SD card hi let me change my shirt I just feel like I should be in something a little bit less promiscuous we feel like look at me I'm so cute telling you boo from Monsters Inc what the heck what is this oh my god what is going on [Music] this is so strange is this smell it feels so I feel alone I don't like this part there's like nothing why am I feeling like this here's a piece inside me the real me and I can feel it like piercing through the isolation and the sadness

next video ok this is gonna be embarrassing when I watch it love you guys stay safe why do you mind like this", "sfA64i6PruI": "[Music] what's up everyone welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about brownie scout uh this one is from gti off their rhythm line off the relax line it comes in at 28 thc and this is like a proprietary strain for them so they try to act like it's super super special it's a cross of platinum girl scout cookies with a mystery strain as they say on their website but according to some other websites they say that it's a cross of platinum girl scout cookies and kosher kush so you can uh take that information and do with it what you will let's get in to the breakdown on this one the look is uh kind of fox taily the buds were very small and very very frosty they were visually sort of impressive looking but they had like that very fox tail like that triangular shape uh they were very very hard as well they didn't seem to be overly dry just very very hard so i don't know if that was like a specific thing of this strain a specific property of the strain or what the deal was with that but these were almost like like rocks they had like barely any stem to them at all but like small fox tailey buds i gave the look a 9.3 out of 10 they were very very frosty nice green color to them the smell on this one was a complete let down had basically absolutely no odor to it whatsoever i smelled it my wife smelled it and she agreed that it basically had no odor i i could barely detect anything you maybe get like some earthy notes and the odor doesn't really increase when you break it up it's basically like an odorless strain i don't know i don't know what the deal is with that but there's no odor so i gave the smell a 7.8 out of 10. now the high on this one is where the flower shines it's kind of a creeper it doesn't hit you right away uh but when it does hit you it's very very heavy it's kind of like a body high a relaxing sleepy type of high you get like a nice warmth after you smoke it but the the high is kind of short in duration in my opinion but it does hit you real real hard like probably i'd say five or ten minutes after you initially smoke it i gave the high a 9.4 out of 10. i really really enjoyed it just wish it lasted just a little bit longer now the taste on this one was again kind of a letdown kind of mimics the smell almost has basically no taste very little taste just like kind of a sweet earthy uh little little flavor to it if you really really try to get it but it doesn't have like a bad taste so i gave the taste an 8 out of 10. the breakup of this one was very fine the hard buds broke up and do it like almost a dust but not quite but it did have a lot of keep to it so i ended up giving the breakup at 8.5 out of 10. so overall i say this stuff is a potent bud i think it's ideal for medical use it's ideal for pain relief if you need help sleeping it'll help you relax ease you into your nighttime activities uh mostly sleep or just like sitting on the couch and maybe listening to a pink floyd record i think that one would be great for this i gave it a 8.6 out of 10 overall for the brownie scout kind of a infamous strain across of girl scout cookies which you're not allowed to say anymore they have to call it gsc so my my suggestion to the growers is they should name the next one girl scout attorneys that's all for this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "Se0teuaSZrg": "I one time I I ate a two and a half pot brownies and went to the

parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for

would enjoy? Especially if they are only one weight watcher\u2019s\nsmart point per serving. This is one of the best recipes for one smart\npoint brownies out there, originally developed by SpindleWaves on Instagram. Here is what you will need. Three quarters cup plain nonfat greet yogurt. I like Chobani\u2019s but you can find other\ngood options at Costco or Whole Foods. One quarter cup skim milk. An added benefit is we try to use as many\norganic ingredients as possible! Half a cup of cocoa powder. Half a cup of old fashion or rolled oats. 1 1/2 teaspoons of liquid Stevia. I prefer liquid Stevia because it mixes so\nwell and of all the Stevias\u2019 that I\u2019ve tried, Pure Mountain Botanicals tastes the\nbest. One egg. One third cup of applesauce. One teaspoon baking powder. And one pinch of salt. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Use an 8 x 8 baking pan. For easy clean up, line it with parchment\npaper and spray with a non-stick cooking spray. In a food processor or a blender,\ncombine your dry ingredients first. Blend until well incorporated and a flour\nconsistency. Add wet ingredients and blend until just incorporated. Pour into pan and bake for a minimum of 15\nminutes. You may wish to bake for an additional 10\nminutes depending on your oven and the fudgy consistency you like. Remove from oven and allow to cool before\ncutting in 9 squares. Once cooled, enjoy your one smart point fudgy\nbrownies with a nice cool glass of organic skim milk.", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you

just want to get over here really quickly and show you guys the packaging of the weed brownies okay all right they came in this they were $10 I know my first time trying them and I kid you not I wanted to in life like I was just tired I so feeling the feeling I tell you dude the feeling is it's overwhelming it's like me because I don't smoke a lot first of all let me do get this article fast like okay so you see the whole brownie right here so I cut it evenly in hassle my friend died half and I got here that half right so let me tell you at first they told me after I got my house would you see like cut it in half and eat you know one half and then you know it just it was taken strong you know I felt like nothing was gonna happen to me so what I did was I took the entire half and I kid you not I had to be carried home I felt like I was drunk like I threw up three times that night I threw up twice in Washington Heights and then I threw up on the train in the train station and on the platform right after the train circle my friends they always smoke so this didn't happen to them like they didn't fill any of it I think one person felt something but the I mean they fell high but their reaction to it was nothing compared to mine I bought two brownies I told myself I was gonna show my boyfriend me and I don't think I wanted to taking these because he also it's not a frequent smoker so basically we took these bodies at 8:00 and they started to cook and they started to kick in like a hour later at first I was like regular high right like I I would be if I were to move line it just moved on to though the world is ending I felt like I couldn't like I had to stay in one place I couldn't sit down I felt like my legs were just being pulled down to the ground like what really made it terribly my handi we were walking down a very steep hill we went down a steep hill and I was very scared because me my friends recently just connected and this was kind of like our first chilling out experience I thought they were setting me up like that's how I thought because we went I was steep hill I thought again scared like I was tippy-toeing I started like freaking out when crazy and as we got closer to the water like after you get down a steep the steep hill the water is there like the river I thought they were like setting me up I was like you guys I don't want to die like please I'm sorry I know we had a bull out and sell for like like you guys are trying to set me up cuz this whole thing is guys like why be walking all the way down to the river late at night like I can't do this so then I started like clinging to the pole and then my friend had to get at me he was like yeah we're not I need to kill you like are you okay so I was just freaking out like I was crying I started crying and then as we got even more close to the river I saw this man in a hoodie and I think he had like gloves no I don't know he was like I'm not [ __ ] he was doing running but he was looking into the water a hoodie on and stop was like you guys are trying to kill me there's two hitmen right there this is my second time seeing him I can't believe the guys like I don't want to die right now like I'm so sorry like I'm not ready to die I was praying to God like I was literally praying on the streets I was like please God please I don't want to die now ready I was going and like I think this is the worst trip ever like I'm never and then we approached another cup I was like it's a decoy I know it please I was just going in like I was so [ __ ] scared I thought we were going like over waters but we were just going over like a bridge of cars like I was like I cannot do this I thought I was gonna fall into the water and at the time that I thought that they were like setting I said man up to kill me I was like there's only one way this is a really dangerous it was in public so I was looking over like should I jump like it was just really crazy I didn't think this [ __ ] was gonna affect me that bad like this whole each other imagine if I would have the whole [ __ ] brownie and then I got home either on the 12-1 and then I woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning and I was still high my friend had to literally carried me home like I'm trying like he had to hold my body weight up throughout the trees it was just insane like I don't even know who saw me and I know I'm not gonna remember this night like of the faces at least like they'd rather than Amin cuz I went in the train route that I put into this but I just [ __ ] crazy like I'm never doing edibles ever again I literally and think of giving this away to someone else that I feel like can you handle this because I don't think this is for me you have ever guys ever looked up like Salvio you ever have heard of salvia like I feel like I had one of those trips like but like for like eight hours I I still feel it I feel kind of light but the way I threw up it wasn't even my wet if that makes me sense like you know we thought it's like liquid [ __ ] like it was very nice foamy / and dry I'm like that this thing's like spike this [ __ ] what I recommend is you definitely see indoors he definitely needs to be around someone that you can trust people that you can trust you definitely need to make sure any one person is over because I mean everybody experiences gonna be different but like especially if not a freak of smell better late definitely you should ask how much we the purse is putting in there like what's the THC percentage because you won't meet rip it out is it like longest with marijuana so I mean if anyone if it gets my wanna like I'm sorry that to watch this video I'm sorry that your subscribe to person that supports marijuana but yeah it was just really [ __ ] crazy like I felt like I was like on crack almost I couldn't hold my body up it was just insane it was just a really crazy night and I would say it's couldn't do it once in life but I really wanted it to be over with I was begging god I was praying God and when I felt like it was like fading away I was like thank you guys so much like you're listening to me like I was really praying out loud and in my head like I was literally like this I God please be like I don't it was just really really strange it was a really interesting trip and I felt like I was drunk like I don't know I went from high

know how many of you guys own pets but if you do want a dog I'm sure you'll be able to relate to this there are some [ __ ] dogs that literally eat anything they will [ __ ] eat [ __ ] they will eat their own or somebody else's [ __ ] if they want to they're [ __ ] insane my old dog you see pencils yeah when I would [ __ ] come home from school and put my backpack down it would put its head in my backpack and eat [ __ ] pencils and I know some of you guys can relate to this there's some [ __ ] dogs out there that will literally eat anything now I'm pretty lucky because my dogs I have two little little dogs I go through my life I've owned like pretty small dogs I have two Westies seriously look up a picture of a Westie right now tell me doesn't look like a [ __ ] snow bowl it literally looks like I have two snowballs living in my house but anyway today's video I'll be talking about one of those dogs not any of my dogs in particular but I have a friend who owns a very very big dog of a mix of a [ __ ] ton of different breeds and it [ __ ] eats everything literally everything it'll eat like a shoe and then for dessert Italy like an empty carton of milk like it's [ __ ] disgusting so I go to his house okay and this has happened probably four or five times I [ __ ] you not that's not exaggerated this dog eats everything and my friend invited me over okay um and the most recent time was during the summer on the most recent summer you know my friend calls me up he's like yeah what are you doing this weekend I was like really nothing dude what about you he's like well my dad's out of town and you know he doesn't live with his mom so yeah this whole apartment to himself and he wanted to make edibles okay you wanted to make a bunch of [ __ ] weed brownies and he literally wanted to make everything possible okay so I just told him I was like yeah dude I'll come over but I'm probably not gonna do anything now let's watch he's like yeah man it's fine I just want someone you know like hang out with so I was okay so I went over there there was a few of his friends already there when I showed up and they were cool people we was kind of sitting there watching TV and like I said there was literally like three other times where this happened he'll either buy weed brownies or he'll [ __ ] like make some and the dog always finds a way to [ __ ] get at them the stock's name is Max and Max is a [ __ ] genius I swear even though he's an idiot needs random [ __ ] he knows how to get to the random [ __ ] so for example my friend okay while back he got some pot brownies he bought them I only have like two of them okay and he put these two saran wrap pot brownies on the counter and this dog is pretty big but they have a very high counter like the dog couldn't get at it normally um and what we did was we were watching TV in the other room and I hear this [ __ ] noise it sounded like a smashing noise I was like oh [ __ ] so we me and my friend ran into the kitchen in the oven [ __ ] doors down and the dog is on top of the oven door and he used it as like a stairway to get onto the counter he like open the oven door which gave him some you know a nice little boost and then he [ __ ] jumped off the oven door to the counter and he was eating [ __ ] he was eating the [ __ ] plate he was on a paper plate so ran wrapped he was eating the paper plate the brownies were nowhere to be found and sure enough Mac's [ __ ] ate them so yeah that happened but the most recent time we were over there and he was making a [ __ ] ton of these wheat edibles like a whole bunch of stuff and I warned him I literally said I was like dude put that [ __ ] either in the fridge like when you're done making him either put him in the fridge or like put him on like the top top shelf of your cupboard with the lock on it like do not let that - all you eat through it and my friends like yeah I got a plan don't worry I put him in the top shelf of the fridge dog has never gotten into the fridge so Y all right dude whatever you say and he's making the brownies he gets done with the first batch and he puts it on the counter and he walks out of the room to grab his iPhone because he left his phone the other room is ringing so he's like yo watch these brownies and he sets them on the counter and he runs out and no [ __ ] joke he couldn't have set it up any worse he left a chair in the kitchen right by the counter so the dog could just jump right up and I think he even knew that he just thought like there was my job to [ __ ] play guard man and you know like block the dog if he jumped up but yeah he runs into the other room the dog goes into the kitchen and I walked in there I was like no max you can't have any the brownies and [ __ ] max not listening to me jumps onto the chair and starts nosing the tray of brownies I was like max get down so I walked up to him to nudge him off the chair and I approached him and he just looks at me he's like okay I had to cut that part out ride to imitate a dog growl worst [ __ ] thing ever but the dog looks at me and he makes this [ __ ] sound and he flares his teeth and it literally felt like I was about to die I was like yep max is about to rip my [ __ ] arms off and I just sat then I backed off a little bit and after a couple seconds he looked back at the tray brownies and I was like dude your dog is [ __ ] crazy he comes in and max knocks the brownies all over the [ __ ] floor off the counter and now my dogs barking you hear that listen anyway my friend's dog knocked the [ __ ] brownies everywhere and my friends like no get him get him get him so I started [ __ ] picking the brownies up my friend gets the dog away from all the ingredients on the counter and like what else he could eat when he gets him out of the kitchen - because it was brownies everywhere he got him out into the living room I'm picking up all the brownies and I was like dude I'm so sorry like you can have to make new ones he's like no just pick him up five-second rule it's like you're a [ __ ] psychopath so I picked up all the brownies off the tile floor lucky was tile like if it would have fallen onto the carpet they'd be [ __ ] nasty but yeah we got all the brownies we salvaged them and they were like fine I mean I don't know I wasn't gonna eat him anyway but he was fine with it he doesn't care if the dirty or not kind of gross but yeah everything ended up being okay same with the dog [ __ ] crazy-ass dog mr. max but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did leave a like and I'll talk some more about that crazy-ass dog but yeah guys thank you all for watching today's video I'll see you all tomorrow peace", "p2kwu8Jsag4": "in today's tell on me yo what up everybody it is yo host

was good everybody but Joseph's realized I'm back with another video and I gave my homie - ok so today we're probably just gonna we're gonna work on doing some edibles some CBD edibles and if you're 18 and younger you're gonna watch this video so yeah you know we go to see I got my about like three point five eight I think eight point five or four grams that they have in there and I got some cake mix and he says we're gonna have to boil it oh he's doing cut the cheese cloth for the buds so that you won't get buds everywhere all in your butter just help separate everything I brought a mason jar be like I think we're gonna use the one that I got because it's like sighs I guess we're able to like stick it in the water without me he said I was supposed to be touching the heat yeah so right now I'm using some CBD Bubba cush that I got from five leaf lowness already got a whole ounce of this and it's like my last I think I had like about seven grams left of it so yeah we're just random that's yeah and you shoulda saw my first time it was like ridiculously sticky okay but uh yeah we're gonna break up this real quick and then we'll hit you up on the next step and we're going to stop the leader for a second now if you want to say anything but in the process what we're gonna be doing is double boiling yeah I don't know anything about that part of the extract I thought I thought I thought like you're able to just sit like simmer it and like oil or butter or something and then take it out like that he's the expert more research than I was I should I don't know I looked it up crass Nate usually with what edibles that contain THC you have to decarbonize yeah those are my thoughts on me but downer that actually activates the THC it we're not trying to get THC out of this we're trying to extract the CBD and that sticks to the fat that's in the butter so we're gonna have water in the pan and we're gonna have water in the dark no no water in the jar then in the jar it's just gonna be butter and I'm thinking when we were to stand down the company it's not gonna be a big how does that work whatever you're after like he's the water to when I was like I'm stunning student so this is just so that you won't get blood in your butter because we're gonna get right back to you there's more puzzle video and we are live all right guys so what we're gonna do unless you want to explain it okay so we're gonna put there's about 4 grams of CBD bubba kush we're gonna put this in the mason jar we're gonna open up our butter we're gonna need 1/2 a cup this is half a cup half a cup of butter and then we're gonna be making milk chocolate brownies today so the recipe says three large eggs I already brought two then 1/2 cup of water those are for a fourth of a cup of water and 1/2 cup oil but we're gonna be using butter instead because the consistency of the brownies is going to come out better with butter than oil true as a cook so yeah I hope I have the right measurement cups and stuffs whatever but uh I should have them up there somewhere I also have a mixing bowl over there I'm about to see that yeah it's over there chillin yeah so far unfortunately I'm not putting that delicious stuff in there anyway anyways so yeah that's what we're gonna do and how long does it have to be sitting in there it's gonna take about three hours every hour we're gonna open the mason jar just to release the pressure so that the buildup in there won't get too high and just yeah he had a couple said he had three break on them yeah I had three batches break on me so yeah we're gonna have that B we're gonna have that in the stove I only have a small pot unfortunately but we're gonna put that on the stove and let that sit there and we're gonna play some for night and get lit so we're gonna hit up back up with an update in a second you you and little video well this is the second part of me making the CBD edibles so I'm gonna put up some pictures of the way it came out because I didn't get any of the me mixing the the brownie mix or anything like that but me my friend he had to leave because the process takes three hours so I have to eat laughs whatever I put the butter oh I'm sorry I forgot to say there was something that happened with the making it because when we had in the maesters y'all can see in the video the mason jars shattered I the heat was too high and we didn't we're supposed to take it off and open the bottle up to be really some pressure but what happened is that like the glass broke so we had he had to do it the old-fashioned way he was pretty much we'll still cook it like that and after I got off the stove for three hours I let it simmer on low heat and I put it in the refrigerator so the butter will rise to the top and what I did was I strained it in a cup what the the cheesecloth on top of a cup and a coffee cup and I just strained about I tried it's like you know just giving the butter off the top so after I did that I mixed it with the brownie mix made that brownies you know took about 10 15 minutes what I did was like cut the corners what I do is I want to keep the center because I had a round bowl a round pan I mean and I didn't I want to make sure it had square brownie so I ate all the edges I plan on eating too when it's seen what's gonna happen and getting the other two later on but I ate all four of them like really quick and they worked they worked they did a good job you got like a relaxed feeling I ate so much for like it overtook me a little bit where I was just a little too relaxed when I was coming on now I think these CBD edibles with the butter cush strain you get it with any kind but with this certain string whenever like it was I think it was a more of an indica so it's I think it's better for anxiety and if you're trying to sleep or whatever but um to want to make a quick little update whatever edibles were successful they did work you do get a little buzz off in but it was more like a relaxation type thing hope your anxiety you know you're gonna read before you go to bed eat a couple you know crash out oh yeah mission accomplished it worked pretty good thanks everyone for watching the video and I'm gonna do a better video on how to make these CBD edibles clay I think we're supposed to be carbonate the the bugs but do that next time I get a chance someone definitely make me there's some cookies or something a cake I'll figure it out but um yeah guys so it worked pretty good I enjoyed the CBD edibles and thank you to Roy Roy Island he's my coworker and I appreciate it helping me out but yeah I'm just gonna end the video here I appreciate everyone for watching and hope y'all enjoyed it and maybe I'll learn a little something maybe not but yeah thanks

where I wish I hadn't used it right before an event or maybe...\u00a0\n-Before work. The worst experience I ever had was at work. -Maybe like a certain family,\u00a0\nyou know, get together or something. Probably something along those lines would be the worst\u00a0\nexperience I would have. Just engaging with people. -I was in graduate school. I went away on\u00a0\nspring break to Jamaica, group of gals, and we meet these guys. -We went to a veteran smoke\u00a0\nsession and those veterans because they have really serious injuries will really go to town on those dabs. -Edibles. -Big Daddy's edibles.

My boyfriend at the time which is my\nboyfriend still right now, had a weed brownie that he got from that morning\nfrom his cousin. And he freaked out because he saw the k-9 unit in front of \nthe school and he thought that he was gonna be caught.  So I said, \"okay let's take it. \" And I was foolish because I have never taken a weed brownie before, so I\ndidn't know how they worked or how they affect you.  So we took it and I took a\nlittle less than half and I felt fine at the moment I thought it was an instant\nthing. So we walked the first period and which was PE and we're playing tennis\nwhen I started feeling a little woozy and I was laughing at everything.  And\nonce first period ended I went to the girls locker room and once I got in\nthere the whole room started going in circles. I started getting dizzy and I\nfelt like I was on a boat. And I told my friend, \"oh my god I think the brownie hit.\"\nAnd she was like \"really?\"  I'm like \"yes\" and I couldn't stand straight. I was freaking\nout so I walked a second period in my mouth started getting so dry instantly\nas if there was sandpaper in my mouth. I sat down to my second period and again\nthe whole room started going around and around and in slow motion. My teacher\nwalked up to me in slow motion and he said are, \"you okay?\" And I said \"no, can I\nplease go to the nurse?\"  I was just freaking out on the way.  And once I got\nto the nurse they sat me down and gave me ice cold water.  And my arm just jerked\nand I accidentally threw the water on the floor and the nurses got mad.  And I\nstarted crying and they asked me \"what do you feel have you taken any medication?\"\nAnd me being in not the right state of mind said, \"I took a weed brownie this\nmorning.\" So they freaked out and they called the vice-principal in.  And the\nvice-principal was mad. She had a stern look on her face and I don't remember\nanything she told me to this day.  All I remember was holding her hand because I\nthought I was gonna fall off the two-foot chair I was sitting on. I just\nremember seeing myself out of my body. Once my mom got there to pick me up, she didn't know what was going on and when she\nfound out she was so mad.  And on the way home I was crying and sobbing.  And still\neverything was going in slow motion. Me and my grandma at the time were in a\nfight and once I got home I just ran to her and hugged her and cried and said\n\"I'm sorry I'm sorry I was wrong I'm sorry.\" And the whole day and I just felt\nthe same way I did it in the morning. Do I regret it?\nYes at school.  But do I regret it? No, because if it wasn't for that brownie I\nprobably would have still not talked to my grandma and that helped rekindle our relationship.  So please don't do drugs kids especially at school because you\nwould have a really bad reaction like I did.", "7aM0lw57oXk": "Wow my makeup with this bag the whole time oh hey guys what's up welcome

public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to

of your cannabis and also you need to know how many grams of cannabis you'll be using to make your edibles for this tutorial let's pretend like we're going to make 2 cups of butter or four sticks I actually have some gorilla glue right now that's been tested at 17% THC so that's what we're going to use now normally when I make Kenna butter I use a quarter of flour per stick so for this tutorial we'll be using 28 grams or accounts of cannabis to make four sticks of butter like I normally do the first thing that you need to know is that there is a thousand milligrams in one gram of cannabis so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take our 28 grams that we'll be using and turn it into milligrams to do that we're going to take the 28 grams so we're going to multiply it by a thousand which is 28,000 the next thing we need to do is to multiply that by the amount of THC that's in our cannabis in decimal form so that means that our 17 percent THC cannabis is going to turn into 0.17 twenty-eight thousand times point one seven equals four thousand seven hundred and sixty so there's four thousand seven hundred and sixty milligrams of THC and this batch of butter that we're making right now but remember this is actually one of the four sticks of butter because we're doing two cups that means that we need to divide it by four that means that each stick of butter is actually one thousand one hundred and ninety milligrams of THC but let's go further let's say that we're going to make brownies and your brownie recipe calls for half a stick of butter that means there will be five hundred milligrams of THC inside of your brownie mix now if we take our recipe and make 10 brownies with our brownie mix that means each brownie will have fifty nine point five milligrams of THC inside each individual brother so that's it that's how you calculate edible dosage you have to find out how many milligrams of THC is actually in the whole batch and then break it down into how many portions you'll be making so I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section also let me know if you like this new style of videos that I'm doing I appreciate you watching much love as always peace [Music]", "T7cyZzpyQJ4": "I actually kind of like the spoon yeah there you go okay it's me that you like I'd the way for you like alright now I feel like super self-conscious man I got thought about it for a second that's delicious let's make some cupcakes I'm in legal Washington and I'm leaving Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where I'm gonna meet a woman who runs the cupcake game here and also has her own line of infused edibles she's gonna show me around a bunch of farms on the island and then she's gonna teach me how to make cannabis infused cupcakes from scratch it's gonna be another weed full day on Bon Appetit so let's find the kitchen and get baked [Music] I hear that you're the cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support local agriculture local economy and create a better Seattle I mean I'm sure you big all kinds of different things what is it about cupcakes that's so special I think there's a nostalgic thing about cupcakes and it's kind of a food around celebration I've heard you also make a line of edibles is that right yeah I have a company called the good ship company so we make chocolate products and cookie products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "pubH1prBf84": "today is Christmas cookie day and I thought that but look who could be better to make Christmas cookies and Snoop Dogg and you wanted us to make green colored brownies how come Green Green is environmental in its racist 12 ounces 12 ounces you're 12 ounces 12 ounces which is different are you sure those are those 12 ounces yeah we measured it exactly okay

them at 420 degrees cuz they'll taste good mm-hmm would you eat a brownie I just did", "EkSaA5_ts-Y": "hey everyone my name is Lauren gone and you are watching another episode of life above the clouds your guide to elevated eating with a new cannabis frensky every week today we are going to make cannabis rookies what is a pro fee you ask well it is a combination of a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie so if you can't decide which one is your favorite now you don't have to to start we are going to make our brownie batter first in a medium sized mixing bowl combine your flour cocoa powder baking powder and salt whisk it together and set aside in a larger bowl be together your regular butter and canvas butter and both of your sugars until it is nice and creamy then add in your eggs and vanilla extract beat that together until it is well combined and then add in your dry mixture you are going to have a really nice thick brownie batter finally add in your chocolate chip and fold them in by hand I've already prepared an 8x8 pan by spraying it with nonstick spray and lining it with parchment paper so then add your brownie batter in large spoonfuls I like my brookey's to have a marbled look in the end so I'm going to leave spaces in between my brownie batter but you could also spread your brownie batter into an even layer on the bottom and then have your cookie dough layer evenly on the top so now we have to make our chocolate chip cookie layers first in a medium sized mixing bowl combine your flour salt baking soda and baking powder whisk it together and set aside then in a larger mixing bowl beat together your cannabis butter and regular butter and both of your sugars until it is light and fluffy then add in your egg and vanilla extract beat it together until it's well combined and then add in your dry ingredients finally add in your chocolate chips and pull them in by hand now add your cookie dough layer either on top of your brownie batter layer or fill in the missing holes with large spoonfuls of your cookie dough batter for an even more marbled look you can take your rubber spatula or a butter knife and drag it gently through the dough in an pattern don't bake your brookey's at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean I personally like mine to be a little bit underdone because I love that fudgy Center but technically you're supposed to cook it all the way through here is my finished cannabis rookie I've got a good mixture of brownie and chocolate chip you can kind of see the marbling on top there's a little brownie peeking through and off they smell so chocolaty and yummy and they love how nice and thick these are it is a nice helping of apron you are I have also added cannabis butter in the brownie batter and in the chocolate chip cookie dough so that way you don't have to worry about if one of your bars had more brownie and less cookie if the dosage is going to be uneven that bite was loaded with chocolate chips and so rich so fudgy and chocolatey but because there's also chocolate chip cookie dough the chocolate is not overpowering it is the perfect combination I hope you

you", "V_OLCJGpjEc": "alright guys so what happens when your dog eats over a dozen pot cookies now I hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead

with how he lost and why does senate shark want to get in there oh my god see you guys on this video", "tBX00caNtlk": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time nerds ropes these have been going on going around like crazy especially in the Northeast you do have to be careful though because there are fake versions of this this is lemonade wild cherry they also have the red which is you know the normal nerds colors and then they have a purple and they have a pink but there is no blue if you see a blue it is fake and stay away cuz there's been stories of these being laced with various other drugs so make sure you're getting them from a reputable source and make sure you really trust who you're going to but if we just get started take a look tear and share No thank you I'll keep it for myself point 9 ounces I don't know I don't know what that matters to you this is the lemonade wild cherry if you have the option of flavors I would I just love lemonade so like you know I obviously picked this one but this is by far my favorite flavor add all of them super potent formula I would honestly have to agree with them 400 milligrams per rope so I won't lie I'm a lightweight when it comes to edibles I smoke flower everyday I smoke concentrates most days but edibles just do me very dirt they really just [ __ ] me over so thoughtful portion 1/8 of the rope will be 50 milligrams so you know you can extrapolate that to however edibles match your body those are the ingredients in case you would like to know some more nutrition facts and this I did another nerd rope edible review and that one was a lot more thick and not you know like more homemade this they've they tried very hard to recreate the exact like texturing and everything the other one who's a lot softer and more gelatinous than a real nerds rope this one's a bit more hard and a bit firmer than a normal rope but these these really kick lands I gotta say hey this much about say about thirty minutes ago 60 minute activation time as I said I'm kind of a lightweight when it comes to edibles so I'm already folded and I've gone to other edibles and eaten them and you know how to like felt it obviously but these for some reason I love like these just get me in such a good mood and they give me like folded like where it's like a body high you know one thing that why is he covered in blood I'm assuming it's supposed to be the you know the rope part but this just looks kind of scary like are you okay man looks like you're stomping in someone's guts and he's very happy

what's up with you bro there is nothing in here bro you high you lying this is not no we brownie boy i got this on 7-eleven", "u7_TdR2Qkuw": "recently I had my first experience with special brownies you know what I mean special brownies with special nests in there it was ganja anyway anyone who knows me would know that I've never done anything remotely drug --is-- in my life as a result I'm sensitive to pretty much everything I mean even the smell of alcohol can knock me out so here goes the story it was around Halloween time and I was at a little dinner party with some new friends of mine so after dinner and some cards against humanity' they bring out the good stuff making it quite clear that they are special and not now even what the hell are talking about so I looked at these brownies as my opportunity to not be boring for once and I thought to myself today I will prove that I am a cool people I think that was the extent of my thought process to be honest I would like one please the lady looked amused she asked me are you sure yes and a thing it in them out things proceeded as normal from here thinking oh this is some weak stuff nothing is happening I don't feel anything right after about an hour that thing started to kick in in the most weird ways I couldn't even imagine possible now when I tell some people about this story there's one part that I conveniently leave out of the story because it was so humiliating and what do you do at a humiliating experience you put that Russ on YouTube now here's the part I was so embarrassing that I didn't even tell anybody and I kid you not for 20 embarrassing minutes of my life I thought that I was a chocolate bar I am not joking somehow I convinced myself that I was a bar of chocolate so obviously I'm not feeling right as rain so I put on a tea kettle 40 so this is some serious news to me I actually sat down and started to ponder my newfound chocolate bar existence how did I just become aware of this what am I am i Hershey's are my Nestle's I could be a Godiva because I'm not cheap so after some careful deliberation I decided that I am a Wonka bar because the package is purple and purple is my favorite color I must check the kettle I go check the kettle not done I come back I lie down I'm hurtling through space as a chocolate bar I walked horizontally to the kitchen check the kettle oh it's not done I go back to the room I lie down I look at the ceiling by now my perception of time is completely messed up I have no clue what time it is I don't know why the two minutes just passed are two hours just passed at this point I'm thinking all sorts of weird rushed it what year is it why is my ceiling on the ground this carpet is so soft I wondered how big my brain would expand if you iron doubt the falls my senses were all out of odd at one point I thought I was dead I checked the kettle I lay back down because I can't stand up I can't stay in the kitchen I can't make a of myself there people around but there weren't people around and I don't even know what I can't even make sense out of anything and they started to panic and I said wait I can't drink tea I'm a chocolate bar if I drink tea I will melt I go back and lie down then I go back and check the kettle and I go back a night out and I go back and check the kitchen and I go back and lie down and I come out again Oh Roz I didn't even put on a damn kettle I didn't even put on a skittle I didn't even put on a kettle what is wrong with me there is no kettle I've been checking the kettle about 11.2 times and it wasn't even there what have I been doing this whole time I went back and I sat down on the floor of the room I was staying in not too bad mind you the floor I was holding on to my feet so that I wouldn't float into the ceiling because that makes total sense apparently and yet I was somehow still in control of the part of my faculties that was screaming to me you are not normal right now don't do anything stupid in front of your horse just sit there on the floor and don't be a jackass don't touch anything except yourself and keep yourself quiet so the male side of the couple comes to the door and says something like there's a little snorkeling I'll do the five o'clock in the morning and I said hell no I said I can't even think right now my brain is not happening I am not fit to make such life-altering decisions at the moment I think I just want to go to bed so what I want to know is just normal or is this a depressingly nervous reaction to that sort of thing either way would I do this again absolute sera did not know hell no absolutely not no no no no sir I don't want to go through that again knows I don't want to anyway at the very least I can say that that was perhaps the most delicious existential crisis I've ever had and I regret nothing", "X0LmCuQoYbo": "[Music] dear Cheri I'm making meals with my cannabis infused oil and I wanted to know if it's okay to freeze

Jeffery raver of the workshop a premier California testing lab about this topic and he said while he didn't have any hard data on cannabinoid stability when frozen he said that cold temperatures do slow chemical degradation so freezing edibles should not be an issue so yes you can freeze your edibles but keep in mind that some foods do freeze better than others but the presence or absence of cannabis in the mix really doesn't affect that but for more information on successfully freezing foods in general see my earlier book The Complete Idiot's Guide to easy freezer meals now this is not a cannabis cookbook but it will teach you how to successfully freeze all kinds of foods and a lot of the recipes in there can easily be medicated so yes you can freeze your edibles but beyond that know that you can also freeze your infused butter or your infused oil that will give it a much longer shelf life fats can still go rancid in the freezer so you're gonna want to use it within six months but you can freeze the butter and the oil itself in addition to the edibles I like to freeze mine in ice cube trays then pop them out of the trays and then I have small amounts of infused butter or oil anytime I want to cook your weed you", "o5k7J5s8JYg": "well douglasville and Fulton County police want to know the true extent of an alleged drug operation that targeted Metro students the drug marijuana edibles hidden-camera fox5 i-team investigation first exposed the home-based company it's called trill treats and Foxfire i-team reporter Randy Travis returns with why authorities are so concerned about well think about its today in Rus how many parents are teachers would be immediately suspicious if they found brownies or fruity pebble treats wrapped up in a kids book bag not only are these marijuana edibles showing up more and more in local schools they become so profitable it's leading some to kill in September two men shoot to death Steven Mayer stealing cash and boxes of pot laced brownies from his life though in your home that's the newest trend right now edibles they sat out and camped out for up to two hours in April kids at two different Rockdale County Schools are hospitalized after eating pot brownies offered to them by other students it's more dangerous in a traditional way and just this month a de Simmons is busted in Douglasville after a fox 5i team hidden-camera investigation caught him running an edibles manufacture and delivery service out of his Fairburn home you're selling drugs to kids you realize that don't you how much money did you make from this he named his company truehl treats this is what undercover does the police officers bought these alleged infused brownies with icing on them in the backseat here and this is what else was for sale apparently being delivered to another location also in the front seat a box of these goes for about a hundred dollars imagine how many of these trays mr. Simmons sold through the time he was in business a lot of the Fox the night team earlier paid him a hundred bucks for this box of a dozen edibles we made sure authorities took possession after a lab show those brownies tested positive for the active ingredient in marijuana at levels three times higher than the accepted dosage in pot friendly states like Colorado according to his trill treats Instagram page this 19 year old entrepreneur is quite the Baker quite the salesman a fox file item employee became one of his 4100 followers and just like douglasville police was able to see samples and the price list for his product line brownies Fruity Pebbles cinnamon toast crunch treats guaranteed to get you geeked he even posted a video what appears to be bags of marijuana and ingredients needed to start the baking process read the comments and it's clear Simmons had people pushing his products in Metro Schools you need more people selling at Westlake a customer complains one person keeps selling out in the morning need to get some of these guys at Banneker writes another I will eventually and to another student customer meet me by the gym before second period oh you like you know the colleges and everything right well has myself yeah that all this is going on up under the teachers and the principals and the security guards and the the the police officers that are there on the grounds these three moms asked us not to show their faces they say their high school kids told them they bought marijuana laced treats from Simmons one girl wound up in the hospital after eating too much you're getting kids to sell drugs in the school not when you go out to the school on the street not when you go to the store but in school where we have to send our kids but trill treats isn't the only game in town never to this day that I would have ever imagined that now we're worried about animal drugs just this year his deputies arrested two students who brought homemade brownies in the heritage high school another faces charges for sharing this professionally baked marijuana edible with a fellow student at Edwards middle school for a sheriff who started off his career as a school resource officer this new form of drug trafficking is frightening what was your reaction when you heard they were that young it was very alarming because if he can get into the middle schools then it can get into the hands of the elementary school meanwhile the mastermind of trill treats faces five felony counts and remains in the Douglas County Jail without bond since Simmons arrests that true treats Instagram account has disappeared but not before allowing investigators to see how a 19 year old put together his own thriving business from manufacturing to packaging to marketing sales and delivery right up until the day police decided this sale was final now as for that homicide over cash and edibles in Lithonia dekap police say they still have no solid leads but it really shows how valuable this stuff can be to some people of the criminal element yeah and how worrisome it can be because these young people don't realize how potent these edibles are right and that's why the Rockdale County Sheriff says that he's gonna have to educate his community to make sure that parents and the kids know that that yeah that if you eat some of this stuff it doesn't give you an immediate high it takes awhile and you wind up eating way too much of it what really bothered him was that it showed up in middle schools we're not even in high schools now we're talking middle school kids and as he pointed out if it's middle school what's stopping it from getting to the elementary schools as well right the sheriff even mentioning that this form of marijuana can be actually more toxic than smoking it if you eat too much of it and what kid is not going to eat a lot of brownies or anything sweet yeah Brody pebbles right thanks so much Randy ok thanks", "rMMHqxyvVAU": "so what's up everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm gonna do a better video I'm doing better videos to show y'all how it's really done but coming with a rush but like I said I'm leaving in an hour to go to Atlanta once again a shout-out to my sponsors blessings on blessings dispensary on the corner of venice and century in los angeles if you guys are in the area please check them out tell them chef doing since you get some good herbs all right [Music] got all that that's real strongly medicated so here we have our butter and here we have our olive oil there we have people Canada's tenderloin

part two so there they are guys they've cooked for 12 minutes the full length I hope they're done pretty good little chocolate fudgy patties well all there is to do is let them cool and give them a try so I'll tell you how they do keep up stay still and here my card", "7F-rOC4RUAA": "[Music] all right so we'll start with the ingredients main ingredient Betty Crocker milk chocolate brownie mix now this recipe calls for two eggs all right and then two ounces we're also gonna have someplace to put it all in makes it we're also gonna add fluent full spectrum cannabis oil concentrate now this dispensary it's one of my favorites see here this is THC 88.2 1:9 Wow and I see the name is battledore fluent they speak cannabis whenever I'm cooking this this normally is really hard to get out it's really concentrated so it always helps to put it in warm they could I normally just might crave a cup of hot water get it really nice and hot and just drop this bad boy in there for a good five minutes and come on up just like oil all right first things first you want to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees go ahead and spray your pan whoa whoa it's like that okay we have to read the hot water that's right hot in about five minutes and this time I decided to just put it in a little bowl put in the microwave for like about 10 seconds make sure you get time be careful getting that out of there it's very hot one way to tell that your product is ready is by looking at the little air bubbles you'll see that the air bowl will go up or down real fast all right so we have our concentrate and our vegetable oil we'll go ahead and dump this in there's 500 milligrams make some pretty potent brownies oh it smells it smells very good and you definitely want to let the oil cool down a little bit before you put it into the mix there's my eyes because you're putting eggs in there and you don't want to cook the eggs not yet one of the best things about coming with concentrate is it's essentially a oil and you can put it in anything anything can rise anything that use oil with you can mix it alright so now that we have our brownie mix inside the bowl we'll go ahead and get some eggs one that's two and asked for the recipe add three tablespoons of water now we have all this we'll go ahead and stir this or we'll give it one more mix ago we put it in there make sure it's all nicely evenly mixed because you don't want product that has a little bit here and a little bit there all right so he just makes us wrap around all right once you have everything makes well together should look like that nice and consistent you don't want to over beat it one of the advantages of using concentrate is that it already comes the carbonized so whenever you cook it it won't impact the THC in it whatsoever all right and we're about to go ahead and put this brownie mix into this pan and let the magic start all right now that we have everything here and in here all right we're all good to go all right so we'll just go ahead and get everything your ovens preheated to 350 we'll put it in here BAM all right now you should put it for 42 minutes if you're using a square pan like I am but just to be safe put it to 39 that's not a good time oh I think she's doing so it looks like it's sad 42 minutes right now see ain't it nice and cool now that we've allowed the brownies to cool now it's time to cut them up keep in mind that until we 500 milligrams of concentrate so what this means is that we'll divide it by how many pieces that we play [Music]", "N1PbTyvE9xo": "move those brownies man you gotta be careful when you eat brownies good when they got that pot leaf sticker on them you know because it shows you has been made by a STONER and stoners forget things you know they'll be making it mixing it up did I put pot in I better put more in that one little corner will get you high for a week so you take that one little corner and what happens oh now you're stoned and you're holding a brownie where your brain tells you no no no I got so stoned one time on brownies man I went shopping with my wife and I enjoyed it [Applause] [Music]", "Yu4e4YEqVLw": "the consumption of cannabis for his intoxicating effects is thought to date back thousands of years in Eastern cultures marijuana can be consumed in many different ways in this video we will be looking at the difference between smoking and edibles uses that smoke marijuana place it into a cigarette containing tobacco this is known as a joint or smoke it through a bong or use a hollowed-out cigar called a blunt when smoking the psychoactive compound THC is gratitude Delta 9 THC which binds to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain causing constant stimulation of neurons quite like a pinball machine during smoking THC is rapidly absorbed from the lungs into the blood circulation from there it crosses the blood-brain barrier smoking gives a faster high because of this however has a shorter duration when compared with edibles when making edibles aka space cakes THC is dissolved into fats such as butter due to its lipophilic properties the THC is once again converted to Delta 9 THC due to the heat applied when cooking achieving the high when taking edibles usually takes much longer from anywhere between thirty minutes to two hours this is because the drug is absorbed by the girl and then processed by the liver in the liver the Delta 9 THC is converted to 11 o H THC this chemical is highly potent and has a higher affinity for the cannabinoid receptors in the brain therefore giving a stronger and longer high when consuming edibles there are many other factors that affect a person's high such as the strain of cannabis use the quantity and the person's history such as mental health and previous drug experiences however it is often a lot harder to predict how high you will get when on edibles due to the change in potency of the THC chemical luckily enough marijuana is not toxic so there won't be any long-term side effects or chances of an overdose just the potential going on a bad trip if you're not careful thanks for watching don't forget to

our not so crushed cookies that are about to be sacrificed to make this giant cookie we gotta get our gloves I am medela virus ready so first let's start off with our peanut butter brownies from enjoyable so this one it's supposed to look like and this is what it look like when I got gradualist unseal this [Music] or crushed cookies ah this one literally broke as I was taking it out so it was meant to be dude I might not even have to like add anything to this mix like I can literally just like ball with up I could make cake pops Khatami making pops next video since we're all in quarantine and I know supplies are hard to get right now even though dispensaries are considered essential southern state open thank god those of you who are watching who are not as you know fortunate to have access to you know medical cannabis and edibles and stuff like that instead of being mad and I'm wasting it all in this video it's not wasting you're making giant cookie you can just live vicariously through me so for all of you guys who aren't able to smoke or ingest edibles right now this is for y'all oh this texture is so I'm just gonna each of these cookies contains 10 milligrams of THC so right now here in our bowl we have a hundred milligrams of THC [ __ ] dude once we get done with all this it's gonna be 600 milligrams of THC the blackout brownie next a fool it's like a yin-yang design I am too lazy to start from scratch and make can of butter and do all that stuff the traditional hash housewife would [Music] oh my gosh this is so much as I'm putting these in I'm slowly starting to realize how many milligrams it's about to be in this cookie booth that's another 100 milligrams in that's 200 milligrams down let's find a cookie that's also like oh so far 300 milligrams are we ready okay this is the space browning we just got done with the blackout brownie oh my gosh can you get these even out of chocolate chips in them which sounds scarier to you guys black out brownie upper space puppy whoa this is so much THC right now this is like over 200 milligrams about to be three after a because I swear to god I'm just gonna be like oh oh last space brownie oh [ __ ] oh my god oh we just put it in perspective for you one dose is 10 milligrams that's why it's each of these cookies they come in 10 milligram cookies 10 milligram doses and this is 30 doses right here crush these pieces up as fine as I can I'm gonna be calling it ooh BRR to go like across the street after this I gotta be so tired so lazy okay so there's some chocolate chips in here I'm trying to like crush up and mix into it so it just all is like one viscous mix these cookies are a little bit on the softer side like they're you know not like biscuits where they're like super hard every time I just like bunch them together they just become oops I'm pretty sure in these particular cookies the butter is what's infused with the THC so I really feel like as I'm crushing these a lot of butters getting my hands and I'm just wasting a bunch so mmm peanut butter brownie uh this probably looks so bad during Stella virus and everything just ah so this is what our dark mix looks like this is space brownie peanut butter brownie and blackout brownie so this is what we're gonna be using to make in our design or you know whichever one has less well visually use to make our designs oh so I don't have another big fancy pretty glass bowl so I'm just gonna transfer to make room for our other mix this about to be a fee cookie right this is what it'd be like a cookie made for shack like oh my god doesn't matter be so large okay so I just transferred all the chocolate brownie cookies and it's literally the entire pan and this is like a thick the cookies not gonna be this thick spirt could surprise me like this thing I know my oven is fit for this but we are in too deep now uh next for our light mix we're gonna combine snickerdoodles peanut butter cookies and chocolate chip cookie chocolate chips might have an effect on the color of this but we'll figure that out when we get there [Music] hey the last cookie need to add to the mix are the chocolate chip cookies oh this is so many milligrams chocolate chips are going over to the dark side looks on [Music] who else is nervous I'm nervous and I'm the one making this I really wonder what this is gonna taste like I mean peanut butter is all these flavors are like okay to mix - I mean you got like chocolate you know butter warm chocolate and then here you got cinnamon and just regular sugar cookies well I mean what wait what

thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "v1rMOt9mMqk": "you'd think that any high you got from cannabis would be the same wouldn't use apparently not it would seem that the high you get from smoking cannabis is not as high as the high you get from cannabis edibles like cannabis brownies the question is how so well once again some clever boffins have been doing some research on how tetrahydrocannabinol THC affects the body when absorbed in different ways THC is a kind of video like CBD only this one is responsible for giving you a high when eaten THC or to give it its full name Delta 9 THC is broken down by enzymes in the liver to create 11 hydroxy THC now 11 hydroxy THC is far more potent than Delta 9 THC which creates a greater high when you smoke cannabis Delta 9 THC enters the bloodstream without being converted into 11 hydroxy THC the other difference is that a smoking high is virtually instantaneous but only lasts for about half an hour an edible high may take half an hour to an hour to kick in but it will last for far longer to let us know if you have any thoughts or your own ideas on why there are different cannabis highs in the comment section below and of course if you've enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel and hit the bell notification to keep up to date

and a half pot brownies and went to the airport to fly to Costa Rica just because I didn't know what I was doing I was with somebody else who didn't ever really consumed it so she she ate half a one yeah and she goes with your bigger eat a whole one so I ate the whole one and I'm sitting there and she's going up starting to feel it starting to feel it and I'm like I'm not feeling anything she goes well maybe you need another one another one they were like the size of like bathroom by the car comes and I'm still not feeling anything and we're gonna leave and I didn't want to leave food out and I got a sweet tooth so Mike [ __ ] it I'll eat the last half oh yeah so I get in the [ __ ] car everything's going good and she's looking at me I go I don't feel anything and she's looking she goes yeah hi I go I'm not as she goes I can see on your face you're [ __ ] I go I'm not [ __ ] high and I made a phone call to somebody and they never returned my call I don't know what the [ __ ] I said but I I [ __ ] and I saw the prostitute we were developing a show and I called the writer I was like I got all these ideas and we continued to develop the show and he never brought up the phone call so I get to the airport and I'm like I'm fine I'm feel anything I paid the guy and I stepped out and right as I stepped out it was like [ __ ] oh oh yeah and it was like it felt like you know I can get foot falls asleep really bad I feel like it was a ball of that likes it like hovering right over my head like there was the son of that feeling and I went in there dude and I just started [ __ ] laughing in the airport and I couldn't stop because I I didn't know how to control the hi I was just [ __ ] dying and I went in and you know either slide your passport or you stick you the credit card in his swear to God like a bad movie I was trying to stick my passport and into the credit card thing I know so happy that's what I was doing I was flying Continental Airlines you got hockey in the middle of here and the lady comes over and she tapped me on the shoulder and when the Continental lady and she took my passport out of my hand and then she just slid it for me and I just looked at and I go oh I go and I looked away and I think for like 90 seconds was crying laughing my wife said I was laughing so hard it looked like somebody I knew died I looked like I was mourning and then I got to security in this paranoia just came over me and I just started [ __ ] taking everything off I just don't want to talk to anybody I don't talk to anybody and I got through security I was like thank God I was just it's just so slowly could feel everybody was installing like ninety miles an hour is just slowly just taking the [ __ ] out of the bins and then this black dude working security just goes he goes y'all my man my man Chappelle show yo Chappelle show and I look over he goes he goes hey man he goes when's that show coming back and I was like oh I don't know and then I looked at another 90 seconds those giant laughing dying [ __ ] lab tonight somehow made it to the gate how long were you high Oh like like dude like when I got on the [ __ ] plane like this paranoid I was looking at my what did you put it this is [ __ ] crazy I remember there was this little kid this little toddler that they addressed in a [ __ ] suit you know that's cute right and I remember when we were in the terminal he was talking I felt like it almost [ __ ] get what he was saying and I was like freaking me the [ __ ] out so I used miles and we were sitting first class I was sitting there and a [ __ ] freaking out you know when it starts to back up the line standing you with that [ __ ] kid stopped right next to me he's talking in a [ __ ] suit like this little Jay Leno looking kid on let's just freak dude I just wanted to stand up and admit everything so for like like two days I was like we I was like we'd hung over like I could feel it like I did damage to my brain and I never really [ __ ] with it again book you", "w0x0XcJ1CiE": "what other fun little topics do we have here talk about Ted accidentally took 400 milligrams of edibles oh geez that was only while he was signing yeah while I was signing acts upon stacks of the posters Ted was just munching on some nerd rope okay if yours is just signed by T or L your sign say you know what happens but so I'll let me set the scene here for the people uninformed about how incredibly similar they can make edibles which are weed infused candy cookies etc look to the actual product then you would make the same mistake as Ted shad almost made the same mistake yeah a couple hours before this happened he had it in my hands and I was like I'm medicated oh right the misfits house this makes sense I'm gonna put that down and walk away yeah and so we're signing posters and Ted's just kind of munching on it and I'm like I forget if it was me or Cooper but we kind of noticed at the same time yeah I think we focus on it and we're like Ted that's weed and he goes what he takes out of his mouth and he goes this is my second one yes ed Ted that's not good yeah and he goes how much weed did I just take and we have to look at the package and it's 400 milligrams which to my understanding is a lot ya know it did him for about a day and a half maybe two days holy [ __ ] yes so he got past the pain point pretty fast I kept up with him I was like the the scientist observing the experiment I wasn't hurt does that amount of weed hurt at a certain point your body starts to reject it", "1pQtrg0yBEM": "hi everyone uh this is like my first ever video never really thought of doing anything like this before mostly because I'm very self-conscious very critical of myself mostly but I thought I'd get out of my shell this year and try something new so but I'm scared uh pretty much at work right now I work out of dispensary in Toronto today I am going to do a tutorial on how to make pot brownies and yeah so I'm gonna go pretty much put on my face and clear up the kitchen a little and when I'm ready I will start recording and let you know how to make the best and I may the best best brownies definitely it all of Toronto so stay tuned and I'll be back okay so I got my face on and I said I was gonna clean up the kitchen and I did that too however stay with me I've got to go buy the ingredients so I'll be back okay I really don't want to have to talk a lot during the video I know I get really annoyed when people do what I'm trying to watch it tutorial I mean so got myself brownie mix make sure you're reading the ingredients you have your oil your eggs all your mixing equipment your measuring cup your spatula spatula is a must I always love it because you can get every last drop of everything out of the pans with it so when you are doing this you kinda want to follow the instructions but cut it out I will explain why as along and I will do as much not talking as possible but anyways I also have my weed ready to grind I use a coffee grinders much we try to cut a thing just because it really crushes it up well you could always use a hand grinder but like I said it crushes it up really well and you do not want chunks really in your brownies and that this way you can also evenly distribute throughout the brownie so but also with a mixer you can use a hand mixer however again you know evenly distributing without one and you might get some buddies in are more potent than others and that's not our goal so here we go I'm gonna go over to mix all right about the stove I've got my fixer the top with a weave in it [Music] yeah yeah so what part I did forget what I was explaining I did pre away the weed before off the video actually when I wasn't recording i importing 10 grams of weed into the brownies the reason I'm doing this it's mostly because this weed is it as potent as many wings you can really go as high as 14 4 ounces if you really want but I'm telling you that you're out it will be way too open and you're just going to give yourself one hell of a time really you're not really having very fun high so then it grows away with really low end weed virtually if you've got really good weed I go as low as you 5 reps or even 7 grams per box so I'm gonna just create this all out I'm going to add it into the pot with the oil I'll show you all that as well I'll bring it back over so you can see my god ok so I have kind of straight Oliver weed out with my really trust me small shop I see it at the bottom there it's kind of sitting there waiting for its oil I haven't heard of the burger on yet but I have pre measured out but 1/3 of a cup of oil which the box is asking for so you're just going to pour that right in great great great the rest of that oil out perfect so you just don't want to give it a good mix before we turn the burner on and it really depends on which forever you pal well not image of which burner because there are the gas stove the electric stove there's all types and each one has its own little way of warranty and its own power and you're really gonna have to watch him this is the first time you are doing this so just could have rather forward here and show you that I have in fact just OOP just turning this over to number two if that's I know I'm pretty bad at this burners are about two and we don't want to go any higher than back to be quite very honest all right so now that I've done that part I'm just going to take away anything that shouldn't be there and we're just gonna wait for this to boil up that's why I just wipe away excess stuff and you're gonna see how this actually does its thing we're gonna just wait I will fast forward this as well what's the master doing though edit evil or not but what you want to do what are you doing this is make sure you keep it moving but turn it on really few minutes makes it and never let the oil boil never you don't want to see bubbles in it yes which why is what will happen at number two on this stove but nothing more than that I you will see how it starts to brown it will actually start to smell like burning weed and there's no way of really describing it the birdie wave can want to leave this on for about 45 minutes tops I need where between 30 or 45 minutes it's perfect and you will see the results as it goes along now I'm gonna see if I put in a different way and like I said bear with me this has my first tutorial so to speak well lot so to speak Lord definitely really so we're just gonna let this gonna go up I'm gonna go I get myself all wah gonna put a timer for 30 minutes [Music] I can't forget that that we met your eyes a blue here pressing through I can't forget that that we met just my surprise it made me spawn I love it some unless magic wet whatever I see you my son [Music] I can't forget the [Music] supplying a red carpet [Music] everything when I say hero I'm in love your silhouette let's shine my love you my son [Music] [Music] you have my heart my son you'll have my home my control limits under I swear with you I know [ __ ] I'm in love with a summer's day for you I give my life away Neverland my son sorry I just wanted to turn it around as you can see how it's bubbling or not really boiling you just want to keep giving it a good stir I'm the lighting in here is not the best a lot gonna lie but it is starting to get darker I can't forget that we met your eyes so blue here person through I can't forget that they will match just my surprise it madness I must [Music] magic wet whatever I see you my son [Music] I can't forget the [Music] in a red carpet your hair you look everything when I say hero I'm in love your silhouette my love you my son [Music] [Music] you have my heart you have my soul you have my home my controls Love Me Tender love me sweet with you I know that I compete I'm in love with a summer's day for you and give my life away never leave my son okay so we're about 15 minutes at Duke okay as you can see it's very dark it just really has his poem cookie bear water smell and if you do the minute apart mobility be careful cuz it can get quite strong the smell so we just keep turning it keep going keep cookie the THC out of the marijuana and into the oil [Music] okay pretty much we're done the oil smells beautiful I turned off the burner and now we're gonna have to set it wait for the bird obviously to cool we can't put it into a brownie mix just yet as pretty much you know you know just cook it because of how hot it is right now but set it aside let it cool and we'll come back to this okay so we're here now to do the mixing I'm preheating the oven while this is all happening so that it can actually be ready for us so I have going to start mixing all our ingredients out of a cup of water and the one egg that the box is calling for okay so we're gonna mix that all up before we put in our okay and the reason I'm putting the oil after I mix it this way we are certain it actually has evenly distributed our oil has now cooled you just want to make sure you give it a good mix because all that stuff will go to the bottom and we just want to make sure that everything is properly done so we're gonna start pouring that into our brownie mix now and this is again why I love this spatula you could just really clean out your paws this way [Music] perfect and now we'll mix that in as well but why very gently so that we don't make a mess [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right elector just like it to the whole just was when I distribute it it to my individual cops it's a lot easier so here you have it alright so I'm using individual cups just because it cooks a lot better as opposed to one big tray and also they're heart-shaped it's almost Valentine's Day so I kind of like to keep it festive so I'm just going to pour them in I've pre-greased all of these just so that the brownie does come out quite nicely and easily and I'm just going to do that and fast forward for you guys so this is also why I like to use the spatula and the pot that I bought that I maybe oil it just because you can get almost every last drop out of apparently didn't have enough for 12 this side I mean on how to present sure why probably put a little bit too much but does it look like it I look it looks pretty willing to to distribute it for everything I'm gonna put these in the oven and I'll come back when they're pretty much done okay so it's been about 15 or so minutes the brownies are done pulling them out as you can see they are perfect so the Box does call for 30 or so minutes to actually cook the batch however that is also accounted for a larger tree when you bake it at once however it doesn't take that long I definitely do it which is also why I like to with a bit individual cups not only for the look of it but yeah I'm gonna let these cool that one star cooled off putting them in these pretty little sacks and then selling just a warty if you are gonna eat the batter that it is just as potent as ain't cooked brownie and this is very hot and yeah so yeah thanks for watching", "sZl6tJNa2ss": "what this Moses Ashley [ __ ] I'm literally like just making this video yeah just is like smelly lotion oh it's I don't like the smell okay first and foremost you already know the deal what's up y'all it's your girl session on hair

subscribe to my channel let me", "LfS4B2YeIn4": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show here on youtube where we talk about a lot of different weed products we review them we test them you know we help you determine which of all of those hundreds seemingly endless amounts of products you see at your dispensary are actually worth your hard earned money because let's face it a lot of them aren't well uh so what are we gonna review today today is about the most classic type of wheats review ever going way back to our roots we are taking a look at an edible and a very traditional style and edible and that is the chocolate chip cookie in the mini cookie format what was at one time the most popular uh weed edible format i would say in california um maybe not so much anymore don't see the mini cookie format so much uh the mini cookies pretty much are all the same they are usually 10 cookies at 10 milligrams because of various california medical excuse me weed related laws about dosing requirements and restrictions so these are from dr norms i assume this uh handsome looking guy right here is doctor norm the eponymous doctor norm um not sure what he received his phd in maybe as a medical license i don't know i i do know that i trust him uh implicitly just by looking at that picture wow he is a very very erudite looking fellow so uh these are a hybrid whatever um and they are very proud of the fact that there are only 40 calories per cookie seems like a lot to me that's 400 calories in this big bag i don't quite like the mini cookies as much these days 10 of these is a lot to do in a single session which of course is what i will do because that's how we do our week's reviews i'll eat some number of these cookies at the beginning tell you how they taste all that good stuff and then i'll finish this bag however many i have left over the next actually probably you'll see me finish them i think i'm going to be doing a live stream in between the start and finish of this review so uh you may actually see me enjoying these uh and two hours after i have that last one or about two hours there so i'll come back and let you know if these are as good as we hope so uh these cost me 15 bucks at a dispensary in long beach um pretty decent price for a uh baked good edible um especially for one as big as this again it's ten mini cookies in there um it's a lot of mini cookies i mean the expensive part is obviously the weed uh but you know 15 bucks is is not a bad price at all for a baked good edible uh on the back we've got all our uh testing results our batch id number nutrition facts all that wonderful stuff and of course my favorite the boilerplate uh garbage that they all put on there about their companies and their mission and yada yada yada i do like reading it i'm not sure why so let's do it dr norm's chocolate chip therapy cookies combine our mom's famous recipes with the healing spirit of our dad dr norm dr norm was their father or whoever whoever this is uh our delectable bite-sized cookies are infused with the highest quality pure plant extracts enabling us to deliver a powerful and effective remedy that tastes absolutely amazing emphasis there's not mine and without further ado we'll see if these taste absolutely amazing like promised from the children of dr lord i feel a little slighted that this isn't actually from dr n himself it's from the spawn of doctor and i call i can call him dr n because we're close you can't and here we are a pretty basic looking little chocolate chip mini cookie um smells kind of like a uh like a chips ahoy like the chips ahoy chewy that's what it smells like really not a lot of weed smell very little and uh let's see about that taste hmm i really wish i brought something to drink um well the good news is very little we taste bad news is the chocolate chip cookie taste is bad it's not good unless you think your ideal version of a chocolate chip cookie is something as dry as like a cracker with the taste that is very similar to said cracker and kind of just absorbs all the moisture in your mouth from how dry and brittle it all is um not my favorite mini cookie in the world uh not at all i mean it's not terrible and you know you're not thankfully don't have to uh there's no weed taste uh no terrible terrible weed taste to accompany the sort of really boring bad i mean this is just a bad cookie um and thankfully it's not too weed uh intinged tinged it's not good it took a long time to get through well there's again it's just like i i assume what the cinnamon challenge is like it's just like um a vacuum for the moisture in your mouth thus making it very hard to get down wow dr norm i don't know if i would trust you with my um whatever it is that you were a doctor of uh again it doesn't even specify it just says our dad so i assume that this is siblings not not specified oh look at the i didn't even notice this look at their little motto on the back taste the cookie not the cannabis in this case you may prefer to taste the cannabis than the cookie i don't know um i would say you've made an interesting deal there dr norm you might have made a faustian bargain we want our cookies to have no weed taste but uh the devil is in the details and the devil said well sure united cookie's not gonna have any weed taste but it's also gonna be just a terrible [ __ ] chocolate chip cookie wow not really looking forward to having to eat eight more of these uh but i will i'll see you guys on the live stream probably with my mouth full where i will eat many more of these oh my god so until then take care thank you for watching and i'll see you guys right back here in you know three i'll say three hours this time all [Music] right i am back guys it has been uh over three hours since i first checked in with you talking dr norm's chocolate chip cookies uh and thank you to all of you who tuned in for the live stream i did almost all of that review uh on a live stream and we had a lot of people hanging out with us uh talking about weed and watching me have to eat all those not-so-good cookies uh which my opinion did not change they're not good nobody's nobody's gonna like the taste of dr norm's chocolate chip cookies i i'm i'm gonna give a guarantee on that but it's not just about the taste as a matter of fact the taste to me is secondary of course the most important thing is uh is it as potent as they say and in that regard uh no complaints none whatsoever uh works great um definitely definitely a hundred milligrams in there uh no complaints with the potency uh just baked goods tend to be my favorite kind of edibles they tend to hit me the hardest and uh certainly seems to have borne out here uh so sorry to everybody had to watch me ramble forever on the live stream um believe me believe it or not this is me at like kind of edited um so uh yeah kind of a mixed bag uh tastes really bad um again it's not the weed taste so much it's just that dry crumbly hard to get down texture of the thing um but in terms of potency and price i'm quite happy with it uh it's pretty cheap for a baked good edible at 15 bucks and usually can get some kind of special or promo i often see them like two for one uh but again you have to pay that with a taste so uh if you're looking for something again that's going to hit you really hard for a good price this is going to do it but if you're super taste sensitive be care be cautious be aware uh so with that guys that is gonna do it for this review again thank you for everybody uh who joined in the live stream um i haven't done this in a while but if you would you can follow me on the twitters at wheat's reviews uh i think i'm gonna do some more of that live streaming uh some of the reviews as well so i'll post there and you can follow me there uh i'd i'd appreciate it uh so with that that'll do it uh thanks so much for watching again dr norms chocolate chip cookies get the kind of you know two-thirds thumbs up from us here at weeds thank you so much for watching guys and we'll see you right back here for another review goodbye",

story involves pot laced brownie weed whack Rice Krispie bubble crush purple Oracle ak-47 just to name a few this is about a Birmingham woman was among two people busted in Chicago in the weed world ban over the weekend we're nearly 98 thousand dollars worth of marijuana robbing malls 51 in Bradley Greek 36 of Georgia were arrested Saturday night in downtown Chicago on the police say they responded someone told them that people were selling marijuana out of a van okay when the police arrived they saw this big van a weed world ban which talked about selling lollipops laced with cannabis um but when the police acts to look in the van they found more than five thousand grams inside the weed world ban now according to the company's website we'd world candies is a part of a political movement to help fight to legalize marijuana the lollipops are marketed and sold and bands across the country the candy soul from the van usually contains no THC but the advertising on the van depicts cannabis plants next to lollipops suggesting a cannabis flavor or the possibility of intoxication after eating the lollipop they also to the country and a fleet of loud vehicles a product strands include bubble cush OG Kush strawberry cows white little Skywalker crush purple purple and ak-47 and a variety of more the Chicago Police said the bags are lollipops which were blue teal orange green red and pink the lead to be infused with cannabis was found they say they also found six heat sealed bags of green paste believed to be pot 13 pot laced brownies and eight weed whack Rice Krispies altogether police say they recovered six thousand one hundred and twenty two grams of marijuana product worth ninety seven thousand nine hundred and fifty two dollars from the van well they were mouths was charged with felony possession of cannabis of more than five thousand grams felony manufactured delivery of cannabis of more than 5,000 grams felony possession of a controlled substance in a city violation of open alcohol inside a vehicle now Greeks was charged with felony manufacture delivery of more than 5,000 grams of cannabis felony possession of more than 5,000 grams of cannabis and unlawful use of a firearm both bonds are set at $50,000 and believe it or not this is not the first time someone in the weed world that has gotten caught on 2015 to Alabama men one from Bessemer and one from Centrepointe ah were arrested in New Orleans after authorities say they were illegally selling weed world candies out of the weed world ban in the French Quarter and last year a Georgia man was arrested on a popular strip in Tuscaloosa Alabama accused of selling lollipops made with hemp and other chemical agents a search of the vehicle turned up about 100 lollipops on that occasion of variety flavors as well as a small amount of cocaine marijuana and drug paraphernalia so in this lesson we learn that Alabama not only loves Trump they love cannabis as a joke but um yeah this is just so I mean if you see this the ban is all it gets anyone's attention it has the flavors that I named earlier on a lollipop weed world candy and it says yes we deliver as in fact we w/e but as in WPD huh and I don't know what well I guess they thought that it was so crazy that the police would definitely like think that they're selling weed I was a wee girl fan but I guess they were wrong um I tell you the things people will do well hit that comment button I'm really I'll be thrilled to hear what you think of the weed world band bust and share your comments well until next time stay safe

whatever you're infusing whatever sort of fat throw it into the into the crock-pot let it melt then add your D carbs cannabis to D carb this I've ground it up lightly you don't want to kill it you don't want to pulverize it just lightly grind your cannabis this is three and a half grams and I put it in the oven on 240 for one hour this is what it looks like when it comes out of the crock-pot now that is the infused butter like so this comes off that's my butter the infuse this is what I cook with and you can put it on bread like bread and butter whatever this is the actual psychoactive THC infused butter okay I'm just gonna preheat the oven if I can find it there we go to 350 so while I'm mixing the ingredients the ovens preheating a lot of just a lot of edibles that you make with cannabis get really dry so you're gonna you need the extra oil coconut oil or butter spray everything if you're making edibles brownies cookies whatever you're making make sure that everything's sprayed so I'm gonna mix my dry and now this is my brown sugar and I have a one solid it's a packed cup of brown sugar into the bowl and my flour it's 3/4 of a cup of flour four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate my brownies will work out to be 10 to 12 milligrams each and anything under 10 milligrams is considered a micro dose I'm gonna add my pinch of salt to this 2 tablespoons of cocoa when you're cooking with cannabis there is often that weedy tastes that taste so the vanilla helps break that down a bit and it's not as not as noticeable and I'm adding 3 a 3 large whoo this is my half a cup of infused can of butter I'm just gonna give this a quick microwave because it should be melted to blend in oh it's perfect so this is a half a cup of infused cannabutter [Music] you can use a mini ice-cream scoop or a melon baller spoon works just fine this is going to make two dozen brownies 350 for 15 minutes so I'm gonna let these cool for 12 to 15 minutes because they still sort of they rise they still are baking so I want them to settle and to cool down before we transfer them to the plate and I add a little bit of icing sugar and like I said earlier the icing sugar and the vanilla is sort of to offset if there is any really taste to them [Music]", "tcy7F8gmRvY": "you did not eat like you you didn't eat that good you can't just eat those bad cuz you're gonna be messed up don't

is much filling in these I got you the best the leaning", "gYVRXNlg0es": "new regulations for cannabis edibles and topicals come into play today and this morning we're looking at what that means from a medical perspective to do that we're joined by dr. maria campos doctor thank you so much for being here ok so in terms of ingesting the cannabis in in in the form of an edible how is that different from smoking it or vaping it so the main distinction is in the way it is metabolized and it's psychoactive ingredients so we know that when cannabis is smoked or vaporized it is heated it is converted into Delta 9 THC which is the active ingredient that is transferred from the lungs to the bloodstream and into the brain within a matter of 10 minutes the effects will last about two to three hours whereas with edibles the ingested cannabis has to first be digested by our system and then it has to pass by the liver where it is converted into its active metabolite which is completely different it's called alpha hydroxy THC which is an a more potent and longer-lasting active metabolite so even though the entire process takes about one to two hours the effects are more stronger and they can actually last a - even 12 hours okay so those are the psychoactive effects what about the effects on our biology if it's going through a completely different part of our body in a completely different way what are the health effects of that so we know that for smoking for example there's the inhaled carcinogens the irritants and the carbon monoxide that can enter our lungs and lead to serious respiratory health effects or vaporize cannabis we know that there may be a less from less harmful alternative however we don't still understand its full health effects with edibles there's no carcinogenic effect so many consumers may prefer this method of ingesting it however the risk is more related to the overdosing of cannabis so that was one thing that I read a lot about in the Colorado experiment which was everything was seem to be humming along very very well and yet people didn't know how to how to dose themselves properly with the edibles at all so a lot of children were getting into it that's a separate conversation yes and that takes us back to the way it is metabolized which for people who might be first-time you in those couple first hours where they're not having any in effects they may be tempted to ingest more and then that leads to the more serious adverse effects like paranoia hallucinations psychosis that can last for prolonged periods of time lastly what do we need to know what else do we need to know about this new frontier in legal cannabis so one thing is like you said the public health concern that there is with accidental ingestion by children or even by our pets that you know poses a huge health risk to the population but also the fact that we shouldn't be consuming it with alcohol and that we if we have any other health issues that we shouldn't really be consuming cannabis all right well if you don't know now you know dr. Campos thank you so much for being here thank you thanks for watching if you liked this be sure to subscribe here and you can check out more your morning videos right here", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "DZTqHxVbqpQ": "good morning everybody today is a exciting day it is barely 7:52 a.m. so like almost 8 o'clock and I just watched my face brush my teeth and it took some midol because I actually got my period this morning which is just awesome today in this video it's not gonna be about my cramps no no no honey today we is getting late but for the like being best fan so I plan on eating this right now so that way and like about an hour after I do my hair will be ready to do my makeup and humvee Heights bug so that's exciting but I wanna show you guys while I eat this this is cookies and cream flavor and it says it is by the brand 420 brownie I don't really know I'm not too sure yeah so it's so funny because on the back it literally says only start with a sugar cube piece sized piece wait at least 2 hours in all capitals it says 2 hours to feel the full effects but you know we're gonna eat as much as we can right [ __ ] now so - you're poppin so [ __ ] chocolatey like I don't want to eat it it's gonna be so torturous maybe this I know some people are probably like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] I would love to

the chocolates of the cookies oh my gosh I don't want to eat this ah tastes like mint cuz my toothpaste I remember when I was younger I watched one of these videos of um a girl who actually had purple hair she's not even YouTube gray anymore I don't know what happened to her forgot her name actually her name was Erica cannabis and she had a video of her eating a brownie like this kind of but I don't know how many milligrams it was that by the way if you guys didn't know this is a thousand milligrams of thousands so that's kind of a lot okay a lot of people usually take like 100 milligrams 200 300 500 is a lot this one's a thousand so yeah I wish it was smaller so I could just eat the whole thing you know like one bite but the reason why I brought up Erica cannabis is um old video is because she was like oh I don't want to eat the brownie and nasty and I was like what the [ __ ] like I've never had an edible because I was like so young at the time watching that video and I remember being like what the [ __ ] this girl doesn't want to eat her brownie I'll eat it for her you know but now it's like no [ __ ] I understand because this is a struggle at least I got to film

what's stopping everybody it is your desk and it is currently nine o'clock right now and if you guys were here at the beginning of the video then you know that I ate this 1000 milligram edible at eight o'clock and then at 8:30 actually ate like a whole nother big huge piece so I'm sure throughout this video this edible is just going to be hitting me harder and even harder right now I really don't feel it I don't feel completely sober though I feel the train starting to blast off yeah but anyways enough of my chit-chatting let's just get on me to it so right here in front of me I have a mirror with my makeup brushes and online makeup products I kind of have a lot like compared to other people like beauty gurus I probably have like nothing but to me I I have a lot of makeup but like yeah probably not [ __ ] compared to some people just gotta start off with the hand sanitizer you feel me you gotta have them clean nice and fresh hands by the way if you guys didn't know a lot of you guys every single time I wear this choker and like a snapchat or Instagram post somebody always asks where did I get it from and this is a life beand st list stay up and stay positive choker it has three stars so just a little reminder toy stay lit stay up and stay positive to me it has lots of meaning and I really like it if you guys want to get your very own they'll be available April Friday the 13th I'll make sure you mark our calendars boo link is always down below in the description to all my merch but yeah Frank Luther King oh no I dropped something haha not a surprise so I'm gonna start off with my moisturizer this is you 365 daily moisturizer with sunscreen broad broad spectrum SPF bug oh my gosh I I thought I already [ __ ] up I got way too much moisturizer how did I already [ __ ] up oh my gosh that's how you know it's gonna be a black eye oh it's not a I'm not a bad video maybe just like an off video you know you eat a thousand milligrams edible one you're already [ __ ] up okay let me go wipe my hands okay so my hair behind my ear is [ __ ] gay all my hair but yeah of course gotta keep y'all skin moisturize you feel me can't be looking crusty so there we go nice layer of moisturization yone on our skin and then I kind of let that dry up a little bit just so it's not all juicy and wet and moist and then I died right on in - you know that the good older what do you even call this primer I'm not a beauty guru guys I'm really not I'm actually very bad at doing makeup but I'm gonna try to do this good cuz like this is what I'm gonna wear for the rest of the day so I'm gonna literally try my 150% best to do this like pretty you know and I'm going for like a pretty like every day you makeup look I might do it like a little bit snazzier with some eye shadow and some lashes I've been wearing falsies a lot more and than I ever did in my entire life and I'm already getting if you guys think I should do a video on why I hate and we'll never get eyelash extensions again thumbs up this video so I could do like a whole experience and Q&A maybe all about eyelash extensions because I know what of you guys probably having on them yet and I know a lot of you guys probably do want to get them but girl I've got that a couple of times and from different people from salons from home studios and I just hate them and my phone's ringing who's calling me Yello yep life being guest on the beat yep okay now you're back to the Z video um what do I do next I got a cover up these acne problems cuz do you not see this face girl I know you do I know you see my pimples from a mile away I actually recently bought this foundation it's the LA pro coverage foundation by le girl hmm good thing I didn't go on my kappa pants [ __ ] oh heck no oh my gosh really honey I learn my freakin hair I got my arm again [Music] anyways as I was trying to say jeez you just want to be so rude trying to interrupt me a [ __ ] um I like this foundation I don't think it's the correct color for my skin but it's not like completely off we just kind of like oxidizes a little bit and then becomes a little bit too dark for me but I just kind of fix it with like a light concealer but yeah I ordered this from Ulta online because nowhere in my town do they sell la girl so I really had a guess my color because like obviously I ordered it online and I liked it I mean I don't regret buying it it was probably like five to eight dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was but it was pretty like affordable and I liked it um it kinda looks like pain on my skin like I'm painting my face but like isn't that what makeup is it's like painting your face right stop looking and it's funny because I'm doing a really bad job at blending this in but because I'm on camera I swear it on camera it looks so flawless and I look so pale but in person it looks way tan and then it doesn't look fully blended I hope so yeah always just keep in mind that youtubers I feel like look twenty times cuter through the camera so just you know don't be surprised when you see me add a bath on no I'm just kidding that's a really bad joke because mm I already passed but you get the idea I'm a Yoko has a [ __ ] basically next I do my eyebrows and honestly you guys I think I have been known for like a good year now ever since I started my youtube channel that I'm terrible at doing eyebrows I've always used this on Nastasia dip brow to fill in my eyebrows but just recently I switched to the honest Asya duo brow powder it's like the same thing just powder formula rather than the dipbrow formula which is like I don't know what it is and I don't know powder I think works a lot better for me and the kind of eyebrows I have because my eyebrows are really fine you guys could barely even see them from a mile away that's why I have to fill the [ __ ] out of them and just like you know I've tried yoga I only got eyebrows online so yeah you know I wasn't born with no eyebrows but when I use the dipbrow I guess I just looked like a lot more of a fake [ __ ] so when I use this powder it just works out a lot nicer for me because people don't judge me as hard on my Instagram comments and they actually give me compliments on my eyebrows people decide to be nice you know as opposed to when I use a dip brow people comment saying how fake my eyebrows are and how well it matches my personality oh [ __ ] I'm just roasting myself now oh and also somebody commented on my video recently actually shout out to that person who commented this cuz they said destiny oMG all you do is roast yourself like don't don't put yourself down like you know [ __ ] what anybody else thinks like your eyebrows are popping or everything this pop and you know who cares you know and I was reading that comment and I was like that's so true like who cares you know like who cares if I don't have no eyebrows that's what makeup is for to give me eyebrows you know like it's not a big deal it's just it's a [ __ ] piece of pube on your face like who gives a [ __ ] you know but honestly I love roasting myself because I love myself and how much why I can roast myself and laugh about it and still love myself and still feel like I pop it I'm beautiful even without makeup you know I don't really give a [ __ ] like Shu who do I got to impress honestly I ain't got nobody to impress like I you know life is just so short why live it trying to impress others Wow my eyebrows are not coming out good you guys I kind of just like slap on a bunch of product and then I get the concealer and I try to like actually make it look like I browsed oh like and I feel like once they get them threaded they'll be a lot easier to do right now it's hard for me because I'm really bad at doing makeup in the first place and then I'm a little bit high off of this edible and then my eyebrows just have [ __ ] hair everywhere like what the [ __ ] where do I fill it in you know the struggle is real right I say my say here's my eyebrows honestly if I got mistaken they don't look too shabby like yeah but not the best yeah they're pretty [ __ ] dark but I have had a worst days bill I've had worst days so that makes today a decent day kind of feel like hitting my wax pan because this edibles not doing me justice so Cheers all right so once I'm done doing my eyebrows I immediately jump into conceal oh my gosh the I fell that trying to talk okay cuz I'm already using the concealer for my eyebrows so it only makes sense to do the concealer after your eyebrows cuz then you're gonna need a use of concealer on your eyebrows like I don't understand how [ __ ] could do their concealer first and then do their eyebrows and then do concealer again you know I like to keep it all in one we can seal the brows and then we can sell these under-eye circles right now my pimples I mean my pimples my forehead you guys it literally has like craters on it like I want to zoom in I want to expose myself looking you see those craters okay like you see him you see how like from a distance you can't see them but then up close you could see them that's like the biggest insecurity I have right now is my acne on my forehead because they're not like pimples so I can't like pop them you know like they're not pimples but there's just like a bunch of like little bumps and I've never had that problem I've seen other like high schoolers I went to school with who have that problem and I remember always thinking like haha I don't have that problem and like all my friends would be like you guys and now look at me now look at me now I have that problem and I don't know so you know if you don't have acne right now y'all better not be laughing at me cuz watch watch you in a couple years get your fair share of acne and then you'll be like [ __ ] now what do I do and then I bake I bake these [ __ ] edibles that's what the [ __ ] I'm making after set these eyebrows in place because they like to play so I use this brow gel that I've had for a minute by anastasiya and I'm a broke-ass [ __ ] that I've had this sample for like months and you know it's still going strong and your girls still not having to spend that extra coin because she uses the samples alright anyways enough about my brother [ __ ] problems let's get it poppin with that bronzer so I used to always used a typical bronzing brush you know nice and angled no [ __ ] let me give you the biggest tip of your life I think I'm starting to feel the edible now actually okay anyways you get this brush boom this one's like super narrow and skinny I feel like this is I used to use this on my under eyes like that but now I just use my [ __ ] Beauty Blender for that and I use this from my mother [ __ ] Bora I see mother [ __ ] so much I should really watch my language Wow okay no wonder YouTube dis monetizes me um you know you just I think it makes your bronzer look a lot more like snatch'd would be the word like it makes it look like well [ __ ] you got a nice ass face you know you know what I mean I know you do because look at that it looks good you know and I'm putting like zero effort you guys like I'm the worst at doing makeup and I can make myself look dragoness [ __ ] with some makeup like honestly I'm so bad I do makeup but I need way more poppin with it I think so much cuter like look at me my skin my bronzer my cheekbones my eyebrows okay no we need this highlight crackle oh um I usually use I don't know what happened to it I probably dropped it just like I dropped my future now I'm just kidding um just how to drop everything I don't know happen to it I usually use a NYX spray for when I used to do my highlight but I don't know happen to it for like the 20th time how many times do I have to say don't [ __ ] know what happened - it was here like yesterday now I can't find it so I'm using this one it's a little fancier than the typical water supposedly cuz it's like supposed to be rosewater who [ __ ] knows they're probably lying okay anyways I'm using this highlight from this palette I got it as a present so I really I'm not sure what the name of it is or like how much it was cuz you know broke [ __ ] I would never buy myself this it's by lorac it's probably like 40 bucks for like literally the only not trying to roast on the person who got me this cuz I love them so much and I'm so grateful I have this because I owe you see this later but I feel bad cuz literally the highlighter is the only thing I use and this pilot was a good I don't know how much money put it and you know what I don't really like it that much because sometimes when I'm a high ass and I'm going like this to get my highlight I'll literally get the purple you guys cuz it's right next to the highlighter and I'll go on my face and I'll have a fat ass piece of purple and I'm like what and then I'll look down and I'll be like and then I have to do it like all over again and it's just a hassle so yeah I look so cakey right now like you know you went overboard when your skin looks like you need a blended out quick cuz I'd be looking like the Napoleon Express with my [ __ ] highlight like yikes okay I'm just cat oh I was about to say that I baked yes [ __ ] I baked oh my gosh I forget everything but I burped it tasted like we for the one cut this was like almost 50 bucks and I actually bought this myself and I only use this brown shade literally every day on a special occasion you might see me dip into like the Pink's but honestly I only use one color and I hate makeup you guys I hate spending money on makeup I hate doing my makeup the only thing I do like about makeup is the way it looks and I know my name we know actually I have this oh let's use this boom let's use it okay I just bought this this is from Stila oh my gosh this really made me a broke [ __ ] this [ __ ] was like 25 [ __ ] bucks and look at how much it's already gone like can you guys see that hole I just put the eyelash glue on the eyelash just waiting for that to dry for a sec and meanwhile honestly I'm really sad because I really didn't feel that edible so I'm sad I feel like by now I should be filling my [Music] completed makeup look all I'm gonna do only my top lashes because honestly when I play it okay and then the very last thing is of course that apply so I'm boom and then this is the completed makeup look honestly I think this I came out pretty good but I think this I did not so that was me trying to do my pretty good honestly from a distance it doesn't look too shabby you guys just gonna slap on that liquidy glossy and boom literally call it a day but don't wait and don't let nobody look too close cuz shoot don't be like [ __ ] is there a [ __ ] party on your eyelids cuz there'd be [ __ ] oh my gosh just don't keep in mind don't use as much glitter as I did and you'll be Gucci are everybody that concludes the end of this video honestly looks so fun I'm so sad that I feel like the edible did it hit me as hard like do I have hi of Tolerance they even eaten a thousand milligram a double I don't get high like what really cuz I fell high for a little bit and then I feel like the highest done like I feel like I'm done with the high like already so that's really weird maybe it was because I did it first thing in the morning so I just have so much energy that I just don't feel the high I don't know you guys doing the makeup I did [ __ ] up here and there but honestly the Amazon isn't too shabby so be sure to smash that thumbs up button if my video was it

where I'll just come in taste the brownie eat it up and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling so this is their as I said they're white chocolate brownie you can see they're some interesting packaging brownie with some white chocolate chips on the top it's got some handy info here it tells you when it was made born on 324 the batch number how much THC and on the back handy Nutrition Facts which I always like to see so this whole brownie has 319 calories and again 150 milligrams of THC never had triking trace before so I am very excited to try it looks like a lot of glute no staple surprising okay alright I gotta open up here here is our brownie smells good very slight weed smell not much very very very slight not gonna get you busted anywhere for sure

patrick's day but believe it or not nowhere in any towns or any stores that we looked at had in stock the irish cream coffee creamer so since it's still marked i'm going to go ahead and do this irish cream brownies for you [Music] for the irish cream brownies for the brownie itself we'll need one box brownie mix for 13 by nine pan three eggs one half cup or one stick butter melted and 1 4 irish cream coffee creamer international delight or whichever one you can find now for the frosting we're going to need one stick of butter or one half cup 2 cups of powdered sugar 2 tablespoons of irish cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2-3 tablespoons of milk one teaspoon green food coloring this is optional or green sprinkles which is optional as well so let's begin first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 350. then take a 13 by 9 pan and grease it i'm going to spray it with a cooking spray [Music] so take a big bowl and you're going to whisk together the dry brownie mix the three eggs [Music] the melted butter and the 1 4 cup of irish cream coffee creamer and whisk that thoroughly after you have it all mixed together pour it in the prepared pan and this is kind of backwards [Music] and i'm making a mess trying to be [Music] camera efficient here and then just smooth it out so it's all even put it in a 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until done so it just come out of the oven after 32 minutes we'll go ahead and do a toothpick test [Music] and it come out clean so we will wait until it completely cools and then we'll make the frosting we're going to go ahead and make the irish cream frosting for our irish cream brownies and you want to put in your softened butter into a medium sized bowl and beat that until fluffy [Music] okay so i've got my little whisk on my mixer here i've never used it before so i'll probably make a big mess so now we'll gradually add the powdered [Music] sugar [Music] you want to go ahead and dump in your one teaspoon of vanilla and your two tablespoons of irish cream and go ahead and mix that [Music] so next you want to add your tablespoons of milk just add it gradually and just use as much as you need to get the consistency that you need that's one tablespoon [Music] so i will add a second tablespoon and i'm thinking that's all i'm going to need [Music] last thing we need is about a teaspoon of green food coloring if you want to use it i'm not going to measure i'm just going to go ahead i'm just going to put in i'm some to scrape down the sides and then i'll finish that up so the frosting is a very pretty color and it is delicious i tried it we will put the frosting on the brownies and spread it out [Music] i'll go ahead and finish that and then i'll show you the finished product so here it is all frosted beautiful color we'll go ahead and do a taste test when dave gets home from work so here we have the irish cream brownies and i'll go ahead and let my husband do a taste test okay so what is this irish cream brownies irish cream yes is that made with some kind of a coffee stuff or something it's coffee creamer caught in the cake in the brownie the brownies and the frosting both okay well that's pretty good of course i have a tendency to like sweets anyway but i really like this recipe deals for easy meals please like subscribe and share this is cooking with sherry until we meet again", "B8AAJNzQU7Y": "it's good guys it's Austin here or Luna so today's storytime takes place like four years ago it was a pretty long time ago for the story to take place but you know what it's a funny one to me well was it funny at the time but it's funny to tell now because you know I look back on it and I'm like oh thank [ __ ] that's over but basically someone kind of drugged me a little bit okay now I wasn't insanely severe they don't think it was I really don't know what it was to this day I have a few guesses though I'm sure you guys do too but I'm gonna just jump right into this if you liked this video please leave a like and let's start this so like I said like four years back I got a text from a friend and he was inviting me to go to a barbecue with him like asking me I was like yeah sure because I knew the person that was having the barbecue and it was all of our friends from school and I was cool with that it sounded fun so I go with him to this [ __ ] barbecue right first two hours of it was awesome had a lot of fun it was great we were just swimming barbecuing it was fun it was a bunch of friends there too it was probably like between twenty and thirty people so I went swimming like twice at this barbecue and the second time around when I got out of the pool I was drying off and someone set down a tray of brownies and I started laughing just I knew I was like let me guess pot brownies and my friend who set them down the one who made them literally was like nah they're not I was like you sure and I started laughing because I really was like thinking they were he's like no seriously like they're just pure honey's in my mom made I'm not even kidding I would tell everyone first they had something in them don't worry I was like taupe thanks I appreciate that he's like yeah man you want one I was like sure why not and he hands me one and I took one tiny a spikes I still had to get doubt because it's happened before and like so many people that happens to and I just didn't want to be one of them at the time so I took a small last bite right and they were infused with something else I could tell they had like some sort of other flavoring it tastes like vanilla or something nothing bad and then I kind of like took another one and I could just tell like oh it's taste normal it kind of just tasted like a homemade brownie would you know not the best but not the worst but I didn't taste to me like weed or anything it didn't taste like what a pot brownie usually would taste like so it's like oh okay you know what this is normal he's telling the truth so I ate the whole [ __ ] thing yeah I was kind of hungry I have a sweet tooth I was just I just hate that [ __ ] quick as [ __ ] didn't think anything of it I was starving and then I go back in the pool and yeah yeah I don't swim after you eat something like that cuz I'll tell you what it gives you [ __ ] cramps okay made me feel like I was 80 years old I had a [ __ ] giant cramp but like an hour and after I eat it I start to feel weird like really really we're like very nauseous like cold sweats shaking dizzy it felt like a big anxiety attack and that's what I thought it was at first so I kind of like checked it off as that and started doing breathing exercises trying to calm down and I'm still in the pool right so I'm sitting over the edge like just trying not to hyperventilate and [ __ ] someone comes over to me it was actually a friend of mine from school he's are you okay man yeah I'm good he's like are you sure I was like yeah I just a little bit anxiety it's okay she's a guy do you need anything I was like just water if that's okay he's like yeah man I got you and he ran inside the house and grabbed me one now keep mine that's not the same guy that made the brownies I knew pretty much everyone at this barbecue and the guy that put the brownies on the table and offered me one he wasn't anywhere in sight I have no idea where he was he must been in his house or something but yeah he wasn't there I don't know where he went so I'm gonna send her over the edge like try not to throw up and not hyperventilate I just felt like [ __ ] I was so dizzy I was having trouble breathing it was pretty [ __ ] scary honestly and then my other friend comes over to me and he's like yo what's going on I was like nothing this don't feel very good and this friend was the one who actually drove me there who invited me there like he's like a really close friend of mine he said oh let me grab you a garbage can or something in case you're gonna puke I was like brought him to get matters like there's literally grass right here I was throw-up in the lawn I don't I don't think you would care he's like not it's fine and he runs over grabs me a garbage can comes back with the other dude who had the water for me and it was pretty cool they were taking care of me good friends right and then my one friend says like I wonder why everyone's getting sick like two other people just threw up - I was like wait what and he's like yeah I was like did they just drink too much and he's like no they weren't even drinking I was like did you guys see any of those brownies they're on the table and they were like no we didn't I was like oh [ __ ] like I really figured had something to do with that he's like nah not like I I know him you wouldn't drug anyone or like slip whedon anything without telling anyone like you're fine alright dude if you say so so like 20 minutes go by and three other people get sick who ate brownies and I asked the two girls that got sick too they had them too so it was something to [ __ ] do with these brownies I don't know if they were just weed infused and we all had a weak stomach so there was too much that we ate because we don't really have a tolerance to weed or this dude would put some [ __ ] poison in there to prank people and I can throw up and [ __ ] everywhere I don't [ __ ] know but it literally felt like I had a [ __ ] porcupine in my stomach giving birth to eight other porcupine it was [ __ ] disgusting it hurts so bad I was so nauseous and I was so dizzy and like it was bad I felt it was gonna pass out and a lot of other people didn't feel good either so I was thinking it was the brownies and so were the other people and sure enough the dude wasn't anywhere in sight he just went back into his house and people couldn't find him for some reason because the party was on the back yard and we weren't really allowed to go in there besides a couple people and a couple people that went in to ask him about it he just would like not answer the door for them so we were pretty much just locked in this dude's backyard after he's fed us some [ __ ] weird-ass brownies and we were all sick so finally I couldn't hold it back anymore I was so nauseous it feel like such [ __ ] I was trying to hold it in and not throw up but I had to so I did it felt kind of good but at the same time it just felt [ __ ] horror but I was dying and finally after like 30 minutes of doing that I was finally like able to get up and kind of like walk over to the car and just leave my friend drove me home because he didn't drink or anything or smoke didn't have any of the brownies doing him sick so my friend drove me home I was so [ __ ] nauseous the whole night pretty much sucked I really had food poisoning and like I just felt like [ __ ] I didn't even feel like I was higher anything or like how we'd usually does I just felt like my whole body was closing on me it sucked and sure enough like the next day I had a friend of mine who's close with the friend who had the barbecue and he was also there at the barbecue I didn't really see him that much he posts on Facebook and goes no one [ __ ] talk to this person again he tags the person who hosted the barbecue and goes he thinks it's funny to put [ __ ] in people's brownies and make him sick like he admitted to me last night he blocked my number after I asked him what it was I'm gonna call the cops on this [ __ ] disgusting human like just being so mad and I text him I'm like yo what the [ __ ] happened like what are you saying on Facebook he's like bro after everyone left I walked in his house and started talking to him and someone else and they [ __ ] admitted to me that they put [ __ ] in those brownies his mom never made them and like he told everyone that his mom made him they were just normal brownies and then he said oh I just wanted people to have fun and I was like that's pretty [ __ ] up he's like yeah it's [ __ ] up I was like all right well whatever at least I feel better now did you have any he's like no I didn't eat any I was like I [ __ ] did they sucked it's like yeah I've heard I was like don't eat anything that that kid ever makes again you think I'm [ __ ] hanging out of them anymore bro I'm gonna call the cops I was like eh you can handle it from here I'm just glad I feel better but I can't lie I was pretty pissed I was really really pissed and I wanted revenge a little bit and I still don't know to the state what was in them I think it could have been just weed and maybe a little bit of something else because like a lot of people got nauseous and I know some people get nauseous from weed edibles who don't have like a good stomach or like you know they eat too much but like a significant amount of people that ate them got sick I'm pretty sure almost everybody that ate them did so probably like 1/4 of the people at the barbecue or maybe even half I don't know I just remember seeing one of the picnic tables having like a full row of people on it just like leaning over just holding onto their heads they felt like [ __ ] and I was so mad about this it's like dude who [ __ ] does that and the dudes excuse was I just wanted people to have fun and not stress and it's like dude that's so [ __ ] up like you tell people before you give them something that has drugs in it of any kind even if it's just weed like that [ __ ] doesn't always affect people in the best way it makes them really uncomfortable sometimes so it's pretty much just you know common courtesy to not [ __ ] lie to people and be like hey man my mom baked these brownies you want one yeah oh no no no drugs nothing of any kind in that just eat it and in an hour if you feel sick it's just you you're fine it's just the porcupine it's in your stomach man they just get in you and they have babies and it just happens sometimes but I assure you it's not the brownies all right I'll stop joking now he didn't blame it on porcupines he just kind of told everyone that there was nothing in them and then everyone ate him and they got sick and he was nowhere to be found and just in his house probably watching from a window cuz he's [ __ ] up but yeah pretty [ __ ] up right well it kind of continues okay so later on that night after everyone found out the next day and everyone was kind of feeling better we all got into a group chat together pretty much everybody at the barbecue that was sick and I think I counted at least 9 or 10 people in the group chat so it was a good amount of people and I don't know if it was completely everybody but it was a good amount of them but they were basically inviting me to come along in the next day and get revenge on him in a different way than how he [ __ ] us over so not nearly as bad as getting drugged or anything like that I did a pretty good revenge plan plotted and that leads on to another story that I will be telling tomorrow so if you want to part two of this video look forward to that tomorrow because this story times already getting a little bit long and I've never done a 20 minute story before and I think it's just better to break it into two parts because it is two completely different stories but they are connected and I haven't done a series of stories that all connect in a very long time so if you guys are hype for this coming back leave a like on the video I'm sorry to cliff-hanging you I know some of you guys are probably too , and be like Luna you [ __ ] Hedgehog [ __ ] tell the story right now upload part 2 right [ __ ] now and tell the story but listen guys this one's already 10 minutes long so I'd rather just break into two parts because I like doing that kind of stuff so I'm sorry - cliff hang you guys I really am but yeah pretty much the gist of the story is more the story is don't [ __ ] eat brownies at any party ran by a STONER high schooler and probably does other drugs just don't eat them even if he genuinely looks you in the eye and goes nah man my mom made these I'd tell you if something was in them so yeah guys if you enjoyed the story time and our hype for part two tomorrow please leave a like on the video I would really appreciate it leave your stories in the comments down below subscribe if you're new and I sincerely hope that none of you ever had to experience that in your stomach having babies All

eating up edible pot products people in California alone consume more than 180 million dollars worth of marijuana infused food and drinks in 2016 half of that was consumed by our audience Because people want to make light of these things but gummy bears cookies they may appear completely harmless But some are finding the exact opposite to be true, so About a month ago. I was helping a friend paint her apartment, and it's hot March and I decide what does she have in her refrigerator? So I opened her fridge. I look down I go And I didn't have all my readers and so I grab a glass and I pour myself a little bit For another toss the bottle go back sit down. I realize that I'm extremely tired So I'm like ok I need it, but as I start to walk towards the door to get air I realize I can't walk I'm wobbling I'm swerving the walls are moving. I'm like what hey I'm taking a deep breath. It's getting worse and it's getting worse then I thought oh My god am I having a stroke So I jump up I run to the mirror to see if my face was distorted And then I couldn't take it anymore. I go lie down. I'm holding on to a pillow. She had I Wake up the next morning and my friend comes in the room and she goes hey Did you see a lemonade in my refrigerator and I said? Yeah, I did. Well. Do you know where it is? Yeah? I drank it You drink my cannabis Has Cannabis lemonade I mean it's a beautiful bottle and had a lemon on the front of it I thought it was a mint leaves on the blimmin Did you drink the entire thing and I said yeah? I did she said you do realize that that was four servings in one bottle Our colleague our friend Terry joins You can make you I mean, how are you hi first of all from that bottle of lemonade I'm still high Your story really highlights what a problem this is with edibles because when you have drinks They go in your mouth or absorb the cannabis is absorbed there as well as in your stomach It's really hard to know how much you're ingesting him. I didn't even know there was drinkable Did you? Think Colorado is banning the gummy bears and these edible candies. They're like because because they're so confusing and there's been a 45% increase in the number of ER visits between 2014 and 2016 Okay, so I'm imagine a scenario kid goes in that fridge you had no idea did it taste did it have that little bit of A marijuana taste to it. No it's delicious How many days do you felt normal excuse me? No, I think I felt high for about 24 hours okay, and I felt exhausted Because it really beats you up. It beat me up Yeah Is there an answer beyond? There are now all these products out there that claim that if you've taken maybe too much it can help you come down. There's the easy There me can't relief. There's no good evidence I think that that these kinds of things really work But this was an interesting one, and I like the reasoning behind it, but smelling pepper That somehow it interacts with your cannabinoid receptors and can help offset some of that feeling of being high I mean why not try it Terry you want to give it a whirl The ideas that that black pepper paint something called carry aa saline which is a terpene it binds the same THC receptor and therefore can bring you down and make you feel less high and less and less and toxic I don't know Yeah It's marijuana one week and huffing the next come on Terry. No it's look you just have to be careful when you're in someone else's home I Don't just randomly go in and start drinking things or eating things you never know.

Thanks You", "qYBs7ryRmV4": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello again everybody and welcome back to your probe of cannabis in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to make CBD butter to cook with but first before we get in today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you would please give the video a thumbs up to show your support so today we were making a very simple recipe on how to make CBD butter and first of course we're going to be using our hemp flour that we grew this summer out in the fields and this is our cherry wine variety we have plenty of it and it comes in at 17.4% CBD so I'm looking forward to using this in our butter recipe the other thing of course that we always feature and pretty much every single one of our cooking videos and we're happy to have a whole bunch more stuff to use now is our magical butter machine of course this is what our staple is to make everything easy clean no mess and it's just a dedicated cannabis cooking device the other thing that we'll be using today which is the first for all of our videos is the magical butter calm D carb box with thermometer this is going to kind of be a game-changer for us because I have received comments like is there another way not to use a 1-room foil or a household pan yes magical butter calm does make a decarboxylated or oven to 250 degrees at 230 degrees for about 30 minutes and now that's your preference on what your temperature is how much you wanted to deke our but the cool thing about this is it has an internal thermometer that you plug right into the box so you know what the temperature of those flowers are at all times now for today's recipe we're also going to be using magical butter coms butter tray mold so that we can get the sticks of butter right back to they were prior to making our CBD butter and in today's recipe we're just going to be used unsalted organic butter that we purchased from our local grocery store and we're going to be using four sticks of butter and approximately 26 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour and of course you could always add raw material to to get that CBD and it really depends on where you want it to be moving for today's purposes we're just doing D carbon so that's for today's recipe we're gonna go gather all the materials I'm gonna get the pre oven preheated get our flour into the box and explain to you what exactly you need to do to make CBD butter today we're gonna be making that butter and all we're gonna need to do is now that we have our D carb flour and again guys you know the drill this flour is in the oven for about 30 minutes at 250 degrees we're gonna go ahead and put all this flour in try to get all of it in you know the drill I can never get it all in then we're gonna get our melted butter and put that in again guys two cups of butter okay now that we have our two cups of butter and our 26 grams of D card flour we're gonna go ahead and turn on our magic butter machine so we're going to be doing a hundred and sixty degrees for two hours and we will see you guys in two hours so this time I took the liberty of straining the butter it's again no difference in any of our oil videos and you guys want to see how we strain that go ahead and check out that video I'll leave it up top so you can check out that video but essentially I've already strained the butter and I've cooled it down and taken the sticks out but I wanted to show you the simplicity of this magical butter tray because when you go to pop out your butter it is a literal stick of butter and that would that's what makes it really easy guys you can see the numbers imprinted at the bottom and it just makes it really easy to use in any recipe so you can look for this to be and a lot of our recipes in the future but that's all I had for you guys today I hope you enjoyed this butter recipe it's really simple guys and if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below and I will gladly answer them if you haven't yet check us out on Facebook patreon Instagram and all other things including a bar website and if you guys are interested in any of our products you can always visit our be alternatives comm and our partnership with them and most of our flour can be found on that website that's all I have for you guys today I will see you in another video take care", "QKImPsTICR8": "I'm taking it to a friend of mine here his name is Holden he creates a hippie or high tea we're gonna get high on high tea yes hi I'm not smoking cannabis that is it we're not smoking do with it we eatin eat I'm not eating cannabis but it's a new thing they do it in cakes this is shops everywhere even in Lube you've got CBD Lube don't shout that too loud round here in 2018 California was the first US state to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis ever since San Fran has led the way the guys are very excited all right entries first of all can you smell oh yeah Wow it's like a strong cannabis smell is it Oh golden right now Holden is a top chef here in San Francisco what everywhere in the world what is trying to do here is to pour cannabis into food use it like an alternative ingredients so it's not like that you come here and you have to get high how big do you think is gonna become as a food trend right now I'd say CVD is the largest food trend out there the annual US market for cannabis edibles already exceeds a billion dollars there are two types of infusion used in Holdens catering CBD known worldwide for having medicinal properties and THC the one that gets you high well you hear a lot about CBD CBD is not necessarily not psychoactive because if it wasn't psychoactive wouldn't have any of the health benefits that people are sort of proclaiming that it has so the CBC is very relaxing its relaxing at you high it won't get you high won't inebriate you th see it's it's an irritant and it's it's just like you know though the stuff your mom warned you about holden bikes all these food virgin so his customers can control their own buzz I make this little tincture here and one drop of this tincture is one milligrams so I'm able to really precisely control how inebriated my my guests get can I offer you guys some tea yes yes please yeah who wants to get high on the tea and who does it THC mm-hmm yes PG tipps they say five drops or five the grams of THC to a first-timer is enough to get you higher than I'd ever want to go so this is completely virgin how many oh you're putting juniper trees okay solutely thank you more than a cup of tea it's a cannabis cup of tea a Sierra we have your classic cucumber mint and then this is smoked carrot and that is sugar-cured cannabis leaf so this is the normal one is there all I'm going for this one because I don't like number would you care for me to infuse that for you no no I'm fine with that would you would you care for a drop enough see ya also mmm why did you inject in food some people don't enjoy smoking a joint and for smoking and and eating at the same time it's not everyone's cup of tea if you're saying that I'm gonna make that beautiful sandwich taste better uh-huh because off the additional ingredient that's hard to understand for Jeff's point of view because it's not improving the flavor it's improving the state of mind well I've tried it and you put it a drop net and you have it a touch of a bitterness it's like a little bee when you pour like sage or time to me this is different it's exciting is new is modern it's fascist for you I get high on perfection you get high on leaves how many drops money to put in here how many you want two drops yeah can you slow down cuz you're gonna be like a hot air balloon in a minute give this a little taste Holden's next offering is smoked salmon mousse on rye toast delicious all on its own it's lovely music did you want to put one more on I want to see the difference in flavor I mean you're putting juniper trees okay no you're in for a friend for a pounds I'll do this one because I want you to experience yeah you know it's fine so now we can see the effect yes such a slice is in there now is it no there is no there is no rag I'm fine people can get very very high so these honey want which one is we this one has the THC in it it's for friends mmm I really like that one's very home it's good isn't it very distant I told you trust me I'm gonna take your experience only the shadows we can talk to each other laughing like a teenager because just found these balls how much did you take I don't know you

punk rocker Johnny Rotten on this one never trust a hippie dude do you know what you know Gino Gino [Laughter] you", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much for joining me guys if you're new to the channel please hit the subscribe button and feel free to

edibles so for my gummy bears all i do is put my gummy bears in a ziploc bag make sure your bag is completely tight and then put your gummies in a cool dark place like your fridge for my rice krispie treats what i like to do is wrap my rice krispie treats and parchment paper and then add it to a ziploc bag [Music] i like to make sure my bag is completely tight and then i store this in a cool dark

i'm going to be traveling for like a week or two and i want to make some edibles for me personally what i would do is i would use a vacuum steel bag like this here so what i would do is put my cannabis in this bathroom steel bag and then i will back and seal my bag so once you back and steal your cannon butter what you want to do is put this in a cool dark place so i'm going to be putting this in the fridge [Music] now i'm going to talk about how to store your kettlebell so i recommend storing your kennel or in a mason jar so for a short term storage you can use a regular mason jar but if you plan on storing your kindle oil for maybe like a month or two i recommend using an amber mason jar so the good thing about an amber mason jar or any type of jar that is dark it's going to help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar if you don't have access to an amber mason jar or any type of dark mason jar no rubbish you can use a regular mason jar just remember once again to store your mason jar in a cool dark place alright guys so now i'm going to show you how to store your cosmetic products all right guys so currently you are looking at cannabis with body butter so so for my people who are looking to make cannabis cosmetic products like cannabis body butter or cannabis balm or cannabis salad i recommend using some type of uv cosmetic amber jar to put your product in but let's get into the next one all right guys so now we're going to talk about how to store your cannabis all right guys so the cannabis dash box is definitely a short turn option i don't recommend using this over probably a few days at the most so my favorite option would be using the mason jar instead of using this regular mason jar right here to store your herb or cannabis i recommend using something like this here so these are amber mason jars the reason why i like these is because of the color of the mason jar so the color is going to naturally help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar which is a great thing light will degrade your cannabis over time inside of my mason jar i have this little rh pack so that little pack right there is a two-way humidity regulator so what it does is it maintains the humidity and it preserves the flavor and retain the aromas for my herb [Music] all right guys so hopefully you guys learned how to stir your kennel oil your canned butter and other type of cannabis infused product so overall what you need to remember is just store your cannabis in a cool dark place and you'll be good to go but uh thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "M64ymN9jRbU": "[Music] hi welcome to can of a six it's Matt your cannabis infused toast here at the day we're going to be making get-ups infused milkshakes now these marijuana milkshakes are more than just a convenient way to try out new ice creams at the same time of getting rid of old edibles but they're also a cool way to spice it up and try something new when it comes to your regular store-bought edibles that you might get at your local dispensary or the edibles that you might have already made at home and in this case I have some double dose marijuana brownies and some chocolate chip cookies that are medicated and I'm going to add also some chocolate and I'm going to make some milkshakes and some smoothies with those today so let's get started the first thing we're going to make is the marijuana milkshake so I'm using some of my favorite ice cream this driers drumstick ice cream and yes I'm going to dare and be bold to combine that with both chocolate as well as some chocolate chip cookies inside of this milkshake and the banana is optional but I would recommend using the banana because it adds kind of a silkiness and it's kind of nice too at the milkshake for the texture it kind of counteract some of the crumbly graininess of the cookie so I do recommend adding the banana as well now I've crumbled my edibles into the hopper of my mixer and I'm an again a healthy amount of ice cream not that there is an actual health e amount of ice cream but you want to add it up in there so that you have a the consistency of a milkshake that you want and then you're gonna add in your milk and mix it up like you would any other milkshake and you could use a regular household blender for this one and because you're not mixing anything too hard in there so I'm using a ninja which is a little overkill here but you could just use a regular household blender and mix it up to your consistency you have a regular milkshake and there you go you can pour it up and I put in about a cookie and a half in there and so I'm gonna share this with someone and you know you can also dress it up a little bit and crumble a little bit more of the edible on top of it if you had some whipped cream you could certainly add decorate these up and have some fun with them okay and so now we're going to move on to the next button which is going to be more of a smoothie and why this is more of a smoothie compared to the other one is because we're going to start with the frozen items now you can see that the brownie there is kind of glistening and that's cause it's hard frozen so you want to make sure your items are hard frozen hold on I asked for hard frozen and this is the effect you give me come on you do better [Music] oh okay okay clearly you're just messing with me so moving along you want to take your hard frozen items and the banana is also hard frozen there so I'm taking two of my double dose cookies these are actually brownies too in my double dose chocolate brownies and I'm putting them in there with a hard frozen banana and then I'm just going to add milk and you can add a pretty good bit of milk here because those two hard frozen items are going to really dense both of them and they're gonna provide a lot of cold and a lot of ice and thickness in there so that's uh that's gonna work just fine and you're also going to need a heavy-duty or a high-speed like we're using a 900 watt ninja blender here so you're gonna need a high speed blender for this one if you're using those hard frozen items so I'm given that a good 30 second pulse the first time and I'm gonna take it out and just to make sure I've got everything mixed up in there good I'm going to give it a nice shake and then I'm gonna give it a few more seconds to pulse and there we go I think it's gonna be done now and you take a look at that that's a lot more it's probably a little more richer than it was on the other one because it's got a little more density of the items and that hard freezing the items and I consider that more of like a smoothie than a milkshake because I didn't add any ice cream actually so it's just ingredients in milk and so there we go we have our double dose browning milkshake smoothies now these things are pretty potent right here so you want to make sure that you have someone to share that with and the banana and the chocolate combined and they're together pretty good that was a nice dark chocolate brownie and so we're now we're gonna enjoy these with some friends so make sure any edible worth having is worth sharing with some good friends I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a thumbs up for us and also please subscribe to roughhouse Studios

yeah", "ZjUyD_uiwuo": "- In the United States in areas were marijuana has been legalized, there tends to be a bump in the amount of toxic cases in dogs. In Colorado where marijuana\nwas legalized in 2012, there was a four-fold increase\nin the amount of toxic cases that were reported between\nthe years of 2010 and 2015. On October 17th of this year in Canada recreational marijuana will be legalized, so I reached out to our\nfavorite YouTube veterinarian, Doctor Alex Avery from the Our\nPets Health YouTube channel. And he's gonna talk to us today\nabout marijuana poisoning. I'm Ken Steep and welcome\nback to McCann Dogs. (dog barking) - Thanks Ken and hi everyone, I'm excited to have been invited back to talk to you today about\nmarijuana effects on dogs. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm a veterinarian and I've\ngot my own YouTube channel, Our Pets Health and also the\nwebsite ourpetshealth.com where my aim is to help you and your pet to live a healthier, happier life. So let's jump in to\nmarijuana poisoning in dogs. It's actually something that's\nnot that rare in general and you won't be surprised to\nhear that marijuana poisoning, it becomes even more\ncommon in an area when marijuana goes from\nbeing illegal to legal. So CBD oil is all the rage at the moment and you might know that\nthat comes from marijuana, but is actually felt to be safe. So just how dangerous is marijuana? How poisonous is it? Do you need to be worried? Well marijuana contains a\nlot of different substances, with the most dangerous one\nbeing something called THC. And it's actually this THC which is toxic and has this psychotropic\neffects acting on the brain that we associate with marijuana. Thankfully even though it\ndoes have toxic effects, it actually does take quite a lot to cause a serious poisoning in dogs. And the risk of poisoning\ndue to smoke inhalation is really tiny and really\nall reports of poisoning are due to pets eating marijuana with 96% of cases being\ndogs and only 3% being cats. So it still does affect cats the same way but they just don't eat\nit as often as dogs do. The minimum lethal dose, which is the amount that can kill a dog is three grams of THC per\nkilogram of body weight. The average marijuana cigarettes\ncontains 150 milligrams and that means that a\nfive kilo or 10 pound dog would need to eat 100 cigarettes for a fatal poisoning to occur. So the situation is pretty\nunlikely to cause problems. Don't think though that marijuana can never cause problems though. If a dog gets into a large supply or it consumes something more like concentrated medical grade THC butter that might be used in baked products then there's definitely a\nrisk of serious poisoning and deaths have been\nreported and they do occur. As with a lot of poisons and toxins out there that our dogs come across, there is a variation as well\nin how each individual responds so a small amount of marijuana may affect one pet a lot more than another. So you really can't be too careful. The marijuana effects on\ndogs and signs of poisoning are numerous and come about\nthrough the drug's effects within the brain as well\nthe body as a whole. After eating marijuana\nthe signs of poisoning also can stop pretty quickly. So they develop within about 60 minutes. Mild cases of poisoning\nwill be seen as lethargy, a change in the way a dog responds to visual and noise stimulation, behavioral changes and their\ngums might become quite red. If a more toxic dose is eaten, then excess salivation might develop, the pupils will dilate and become large, vomiting may start along with diarrhea and your dog might also start\nto urinate uncontrollably. And muscle tremors will also develop. And in fact about 99% of\nmarijuana poisoning cases there are nervous or neurological signs. Whereas only about 30%\nwill develop intestinal, so vomiting or diarrhea. A higher dose again might\nthen result in your dog becoming unsteady on their feet, their blood pressure might drop, they might develop hypothermia. The heart can slow. And as with a lot of poisons, it will all eventually lead\nto seizures, coma, and death. The effects of marijuana\non dogs can last for hours and they can even last for days. And that's because the THC\nis actually partly stored in the body's fat and\nit's then released slowly over a number of days. So that being said, what's the treatment\nto marijuana poisoning? So while the likelihood of severe life-threatening poisoning is pretty low, as I've just discussed. You'll appreciate from some of the signs that in some cases\ntreatment will be needed to prevent any poisoning complications. Dogs that are severely\nagitated or hyperactive may need to be sedated. IV fluids may need to be given to help just control body temperature, to support blood pressure, and to prevent dehydration that results from vomiting and diarrhea\nand excessive salivation. Muscle relaxant or\nanti-seizure medication may be needed in the case of\nsevere tremors or seizures. And in rare life-threatening cases when large amounts have been eaten the stomach may even need to be emptied, enemas given and activated\ncharcoal administered. Just to try and remove and absorb as much of the toxin as possible. Now the big difficulty with\ntreatment of marijuana poisoning and marijuana poisoning in general, in dogs is knowing that this is actually the problem in the first place. So in many cases owners are\nreluctant to tell their vet that this is what the dog has\neaten or might have eaten. Now there are human urine\ntests for marijuana, but these are actually\nreally unreliable in dogs and so they'll often\ngive incorrect results. It's vital therefore that\nyou let your vet know if your dog has eaten marijuana. Without this information\nit really is impossible to differentiate the\nsigns the dog is showing from many other toxins. Poisoning with different\ntoxins or food items, it comes with different prognosis and different treatment options. And not knowing the cause of poisoning, it can just mean that a\ndog is given unnecessary treatment or it's actually\ntreated more aggressively than they would otherwise need to be in the case of marijuana poisoning. And that wastes both time and money. If your dog has eaten\nmarijuana in any form then just let your vet know. It's really important information and it should not be withheld. As with all poisonings\nprevention is better than cure and my tips for this is just\nto keep marijuana products and that includes edibles\nand baked goods in high pet-proof cupboards\nor in locked drawers. Make sure your pet is not\naround if marijuana is being smoked or consumed and only\nallow them back in the room once everything's been cleared\nup or all smoke has cleared. And finally just never give\nyour pet marijuana on purpose. It's really not funny although it's something some people do do. Now as I mentioned at the start, CBD oil is a different cannabis extract and that does not\nactually contain any THC. So CBD oil is considered non-toxic and it has several potentially valuable medical effects on the body. If you want to learn more about this then I've actually got a separate\nvideo over on my channel. For now though thanks again to Ken for inviting me back to talk to you all today. I hope that was interesting\nand until next time, take care. - A huge thank you to Doctor Alex from the Our Pets Health YouTube channel for joining us today and I hope this is the kind of information\nthat you never need, but I'm really glad that you have it.

(gentle music)", "KEnHP8Z0YWw": "how to not sub on a gig footage that you're now watching is of me playing at Rockwood Music Hall stage one and the Lower East Side of Manhattan subbing in ships errands bands they play intense instrumental jazz fusion music with all kinds of odd time signatures it's loud it's fast it's complicated there are two drummers in this instance right now as you're watching this footage I am hi out of my damn mind let me tell you about one of the worst experiences I've ever had on a stage yes this is going to be me telling the story of that one time I got to high burning weed in hell anyway this was the second show of an evening of fusion gigs for me I was an only subbing on chubbs gig but earlier in the evening as well with the planetary people who are playing at Club groove in the West Village many of the same people friends of mine and musical colleagues that I play with in other contexts also play in both bands that I was playing with that is here so Angelo is subbing on this gig too and he's subbing for Josh who's on the next gig and Angelo is also on the next gig it's kind of like a musical chairs it's a very incestuous sort of situation we have going on here so enjoy enjoy the incest the music for this first gig was actually fairly difficult and because I was subbing I hadn't had a chance to rehearse it with the band the trap version yeah turns out the trap version of jazz crimes was not the one that we were supposed to have learned go figure since these were people that I knew and trusted I wasn't worried about this gig even if we hadn't rehearsed yet together there's a screen right here that's gonna come up when we let me start playing in situations where you're performing with a band and you haven't rehearsed with them it can be fairly nerve-racking but you learn to stay focused and stayed grounded [Applause] [Music] even when little things go wrong and there might be a mistake here and there it's next to is the opposite of slow-jam [Applause] [Music] you learn to shrug it off and just keep going mistakes happen for me though it requires a fair amount of self-control to be able to regulate that adrenal response and not get too wrapped up in my own thoughts there are plenty of these little mistakes all night but honestly that's to be expected and I thought the gig went pretty well so after the gig I wanted to unwind a little bit after a fairly stressful situation [Music] [Applause] that's important part of the gig getting paid somebody who shall remain nameless in the planetary people offered me some of their weed brownie and I took some of that to unwind in lieu of alcohol Angelo and I then went across Houston streets to punjabi deli to eat dinner was about halfway through my China masala that I realized that the next gig well the next gig was going to be a little bit of an ordeal the brownie that eh it was much stronger than I was led to believe and for the next hour I would be unbelievably unreasonably high so the next gig is with ships Iran at Rockwood Stage one we got one fusion gig down and that guy that guy will talk to you soon all the mental clarity and focus that got me through the first sub gig would be completely gone for the second one and so I would have to white-knuckle it just to survive we got on stage in the first tune slip started it's a fast oddly phrased composition that at one point involves quintuplet metric modulation it's odd you don't really see it in my face but I am feeling in this moment of fear that I have never felt in my life before [Music] I'm really seriously considered bolting out of Rockwood stage 1 never to interact with any of these people ever again in the middle of the song and in fact there's one point that you can actually see me consider that my iPad with all my sheet music freezes at the exact moment I forgot how the song I was playing goes I was so scared for so many reasons the people on stage I really respected as musicians and friends and I was letting them down there are tons of people in the audience that I knew and invited to come see me and I was letting all of them down as well at some point mark shoves normal bass player walked into rock wood it was subbing because he couldn't play the first half of the gig and I jokingly offered him my bass I mean it looked like I was joking but I was actually quite serious I really wanted him to play and save me at one point I looked over to Brian plows and Jared Yee playing saxophone and I just knew that they knew that I was high and that terrified me [Music] faster the scariest thing is that there was a moment where I got lost I could not hear where the downbeat was I did not know where one was obviously that's incredibly scary and embarrassing for anybody who has been through that situation but for me it really just made me mad at myself [Music] it gives me is that my ability to play music with my friends these people that I respect so much and make such amazing exciting music my ability to play music with them was impaired and that sucks I lost myself in the music but like not in a good way and it's interesting looking back at this footage because the music actually sounds pretty good the band sounds incredible and my bass playing sounds alright I guess [Music] but it would have been really nice to enjoy the music in the moment sober [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's a reason I think white musicians like Frank Zappa ended up being fairly anti-drug he wanted to experience his avant-garde music his weird music his exciting music with a clarity and presence of a sober mind I'm constantly beating myself up for experiencing cheb saurons music onstage without that clarity of mine that experience in that gig would have been so much more meaningful to me had I not been high anyway I really don't want to moralize here with this narrative I just wanted to share my own personal experiences with the drug and also the process I've gone through to learn what I can and can't do on a stage in order to feel most fulfilled with the music that I want to make I simply could not do that while I was impaired and it's incredibly frustrating so even if the music that I was making was fine and my bass lines were fine and it wasn't too sloppy and people were getting inspired by the music that I was making I I wasn't and so that's the story of the time that I got way too high okay so there's a little bit of a PostScript to this video this video was all about performing well hi now I admit when I've gotten high with my musical friends we've jam there's been a really enjoyable experience but it's been an enjoyable experience in the same way that getting high and watching TV and eating snacks with friends has been an enjoyable experience but personally for me when I get on a stage I want to kind of elevate my experience beyond the hedonistic equivalent of Netflix and snacks now some people have said to me that they feel more creative when they're high and they're able to write music that they wouldn't normally be able to write while they're sober personally for me that hasn't really been the case and I think of my friend Ben Levin who doesn't really drink or smoke and I think of how he's able to create some pretty amazing pieces of art not only visually with his animation but also his music and you know I think well if he can do it that way why can't I again I do not want to moralize with any of this this is a personal choice that I've made and it's a personal choice that a lot of people will eventually have to make because quite honestly the music industry is very much based on a culture of alcohol and marijuana consumption and navigating that is important for your own personal well-being and your mental health so anyway if you want to watch the whole video of me playing with chips Aaron's band I've linked it for my patreon patrons go check me out on patreon if you haven't already and thank you so much everybody for watching [Music] please", "2t1zAl2y4WA": "what's up family and how we doing tonight and welcome to another great episode of Bammer TV I am Dave your host as always and don't forget to tune in to the weed reviews playlist we are posting a new weed review every week or two weeks right now so definitely tune in for that but today I want to give you a quick little how-to video on something that we really should be thinking about a little bit more and that is how to accurately dose your edibles the big thing with this is you don't want to accidentally give anyone an overdose it is possible to overdose on edibles I have done it it's not a very fun time what I want to tell you guys is how to accurately dose your edibles and it's actually a fairly easy process as long as you have all of the right information what information do you actually need for this process you need the accurate test results for your butt or your trim whatever you're using for your edibles and you need a reliable method of extraction and a reliable method of integration or homogenous ation into your edibles to make sure that it's fairly dose throughout the entire batch and not just you know you have one cookie that's 500 milligrams you have another cookie that's 10 so you take your test results from your reliable lab or however your tester marijuana and you take the number that is the percentage of THC so the average is about 24 so let's go with 24 for today so if you're T of your weed has an average of 24 percent THC in your test results that breaks down to 240 milligrams per gram if you're not good at math here we go one gram is one thousand milligrams so if you have 24 percent of that is THC you know that it's 240 milligrams per gram is THC so what do you do with that information you take that number times it by however many grams of marijuana you want to add into your butter oil tincture have whatever you want to do and that is your total dosage for that product say your you use 10 grams of 24% THC marijuana so you know that your batch currently has 2,400 milligrams of marijuana if you're using this in edibles and say you're dosed in your butter the same way and you want to make sure you get 12 cookies out of this batch you take your 2,400 milligrams of THC divided by 12 and now you have 12 200 milligram pieces to enjoy as far as dosing for beginners and whoever else may be eating these you have to understand when you consume edibles your system intensifies it there's an enzyme in I believe it's your liver that transfers the Delta 9 THC into Delta 11 THC which is approximately four times more potent so you have to be very careful when you're dosing your edibles because even a dose of 50 milligrams in your system is more like 150 to 200 milligrams so you really have to be careful with this stuff that being said guys remember you need accurate test results from your lab you need accurate and reliable homogenous ation skills to make sure that everything is completely incorporated throughout the entire batch and then you need to be able to do some basic math that's my little spiel for today I hope you enjoyed it like I said in the beginning tune in for more weed reviews and other marijuana product reviews and like I said I'm Dave from Bama TV pleasure as always and I'll be seeing you there [Music]", "fVIze4o9Qg8": "Sorry. Yes. Hi, I'm Bastiaan.\n-And I'm Nellie. And I'm Rens.\n-Welcome in our Drugslab. Today is our one-year anniversary.\n-We have balloons, festoons... and cake, of course.\n-But we're in our Drugslab... so it's not just a cake,\nit's a space cake, of course. And you often ask us to take drugs\nwith the three of us. Today we'll do so.\n-Today's the day. Our space cake contains 5 gm of weed.\n-We first made weed butter with it... so it gets distributed evenly\nthroughout the cake. Once it's done, you cut it into slices\nof 1 cm and take one slice a person. If you want to make your own space cake... in an other video Bastiaan\nand I show you how. Looks good, right? Very festive. I'm excited about all three of us\ndoing drugs. Bastiaan decorated it.\n-Yes. This is the weed that's in the cake.\nIt's White Widow. This is what it looks like in the end.\nAnd... you do smell that there's weed inside.\nBut not that much. Just eating it would be boring,\nso we'll play some fun games. Starting with bite-the-cake. Are you excited?\n-Sure. I can't hear you? Okay, three, two, one... It's too high for me.\n-For me too. Oh, yummy. Pretty gross.\n-No, yummy. You like it?\n-No, wait. Gross, isn't it?\n-It's not gross at all. You really don't like it?\n-It is a contest, remember. Oh, right. I don't think it's that gross.\nIt's just cake with a slight weed flavour. We have a winner. The biggest risk with space cake\nis taking more too soon. Normally you smoke it\nand it gets absorbed right away. When you eat it, it has to pass through\nyour intestines first. So wait 1 1/2 hour before taking more,\notherwise it can be really overwhelming. It's been 1 1/2 hour.\n-Yes. You guys are stoned, aren't you?\n-I sure am. Yes.\n-I don't feel much yet. Cherry syrup.\n-Cheers. To Drugslab.\n-To Drugslab. Yes, to Drugslab. He's really high as a kite. We all had the same amount. \nYou don't feel anything yet... I quickly felt something,\nand he's just totally out of it. Look. I can't handle it anymore. Look how stoned he is.\n-I can't handle it anymore. Time for another game. Maybe you\nknow this one: egg and spoon race. You have to walk around with an egg\non a spoon and hope it doesn't fall off. In other countries they're like:\nwhat the fuck? It's a Dutch game,\na typically Dutch game. Sorry. It's like some kind of game show\u2026 \nOn this side... And on the other side...\n-That's exactly how I felt. I'm dying.\n-Okay. Space cake contains weed,\nand weed contains THC. One thing it does is relax your muscles\nand decrease your coordination. The men will walk around the desk\nfive times with an egg on their spoon. The egg mustn't fall off.\n-And if it does, you're out. The first to return to the starting point\nis the winner. Okay, we both get it.\n-You're also stoned now. Maybe I'm starting to feel something,\nbut not all that much. Three, two, one, go. I'm going to win, I'm faster.\n-Not. Definitely. Yes... Yes, I've won. His egg is broken. You're the winner.\n-So I'm the winner. Yes, okay.\n-Nice. Space cake can provide closed-eye visualizations. Rens, are you experiencing that?\n-No. Your muscles relax as well, so Rens\nis going to bust this cannabis pi\u00f1ata. I'm facing the same way again.\n-That's right. Okay. Yes?\n-Yes. That looks festive.\n-Did it take you more effort? No, I thought it went rather well. A bouncy ball. Yo, look. Since it affects your coordination, never\ngo out in traffic after eating space cake. And don't combine it with alcohol\nor other drugs. Or medicines.\n-But sex is fine. Or if you're prone to psychoses.\nBut sex is fine. Here, yummy. Do you want it? It's time for the next game.\nWe're going to play straw soccer. This is the player, the straw.\nBlow the ball into the other's goal. Are you excited?\n-Yes. How do you feel?\n-Excellent. Do you think you'll win?\n-Yes. Excited. Nervous?\n-No. What about you?\n-Relaxed. Yes, Nellie has won.\nCongratulations. Well done. I look like a loser now. You're really stoned.\nI feel pretty stoned as well. I feel the least, I think. But I do feel it in my muscles\nand when I sit for a while it feels good. THC mimics a substance called\nanandamide... which bonds to receptors in your brain. And they influence your hunger centre. So you may get the munchies\nand have a craving for food. Are you craving food?\n-Absolutely. Especially sweets?\n-Yes. Then you first have to suffer.\n-This is a Dutch game called candy diving. What an invention.\n-Yes. I used to play this too.\n-At parties? The idea is that you grab\na candy with your mouth... but there's water inside,\nso that makes it hard. Here I go. Yes, she did it. Do you want to take a turn?\n-No, that's fine. We've seen what it's like. The party's over.\n-And it was fun. It was great fun.\n-Terrific. Here we have a bunch of comments\nyou've left this past year. We're going to read some.\n-Great. Excited?\n-Yes, I really am. Yes, me too. Everybody has blue eyes in the videos,\nare you aliens? Well, actually... We're robots.\n-How do you know? - That\u2019s a Robot... We're actually stereotypically Dutch.\nWe can't help it. Nellie is adorable as hell.\nDamn cute, want to give her hugs. We can hug her. That's very sweet, hug back. What country is this? Can I move in? We're in the Netherlands, which\nis where we live. We all do, right? Everyone thinks all drugs\nare legal here, but they're not. Not at all. We do a lot of illegal things.\n-Naughty. They talk like The Sims. Because of our hard 'g'.\n-But that's how our language sounds. I love how Rens is always happy\nif he gets to try the drugs. Rens is always up for it.\n-That's right. I love going to work. Bastiaan reminds me of Pewdiepie... PewDiePie.\n-What? PewDiePie, a really big YouTuber.\n-One of the biggest. How stupid... They're laughing back there\nbecause I said it wrong. Pewdiepew.\n-Peedipee. How do you pronounce this?\n-PewDiePie. That's not how you write it.\n-We'll be roasted on YouTube. No, this is unacceptable. That look on Bastiaan's face when Rens\ngives him a high-five with his faphand. Oh yeah, I remember that. Everyone went berserk. Did you wash your hands first?\n-Yes, I did. They were clean, I'm afraid. DMT!!!! Soon again, right, guys?\n-I think this is the comment... Most comments were about DMT.\nAt some point it was really... You did it.\n-I did it, and I'm sure you guys will too. What? How many cats does Nellie have? Three.\n-What are their names? Luffy, Ace and Vivi. So why is there a dick on the chalkboard? I thought the nicest dick,\nand maybe we can show a picture... was the one with the cap.\n-Yes. I think that next time one person\nhas to stay sober again. Next time at my place.

And I really love you guys a lot.\n-Same here. And we love you.\n-Yes. Good morning.\n-It's sunny, I'm at the park and feel fine. The rush was gone when I came home. I think it's heavy stuff.\nI did it once when I was 18. They were huge slices.\nI was completely out of it. I passed out and got totally paranoid. I slept really well. I didn't feel much\nfrom the cake yesterday. Only that my body relaxed and I was\na bit gigglish and I felt nice and warm. But you see that if you don't take more\nand don't make the cake too strong... you can handle it and then it's fine. I had a great day with Nellie\nand Bastiaan, so that was cool. It was fun to do drugs with us three, but\nthe next time we'll do it the old way again. I find being stoned pretty intense. This was Drugslab for this week.\nCurious about a drug? Let us know.

juice", "Hdz8dwSMVcE": "hey what's up you guys so I'm gonna give a storytime and engaging story time this story is a very um okay it's embarrassing I have to admit that but it happened and it's funny when I think about it now we're doing the time I ate a wee brownie so we start off I go to my cousin's house I eat I Isaiah Gaby realize that my deal game is I go to a sounds kick so when I go there I just think it's gonna be a fun time we're gonna do some cool stuff I don't know what's gonna happen um so yeah it's just like regular for all that time right now we're just like having fun telling jokes playing video games and then I saw brownies hidden under a blanket so I thought my cousin can have one and you know him yeah you know you know so I took one and then like 25 minutes later my not even like 10 minutes later Gaby was like did you eat the brownie and I'll say yeah and then they're like those are we drownings and I was like what this is totally brownies those are we brownies and then yeah my cousin I did he said you know ghetto so we branded you ate those in and Jennifer say those are lethal Mounties you ate those and then I was paying I wasn't panicking I was just like they're not my brownies were just trying to scare me but then the part that really was the last nail in the coffin was when my cousin Savannah Torres came into the room and she did walk into the room like nothing ever happened and Gaby this is hit the brownies and all they did she heard her sing - what and they didn't talk to her beforehand about the situation she just said what so that's what I was I started I started panicking I didn't know what to do I was like I don't know I was just panicking I had no ID so many thoughts are going around mind I'm saying my parents are gonna kill me am I gonna die am I gonna overdose if I had the entire brownie and I oh I was scared so then um what happened was like they were like I just accepted it and I started crying I like tell me was I started crying my eyes out they thought I was kidding but there was tears coming out of my eyes because I thought that I got was getting a high and then for some reason my eyes started turning red and then my mouth was dry and if you don't know what those symptoms are that's the symptoms of what happens when you start to get high so in my mind I was high what would you guys do in my situation you were a young 7th grader and you were known by your entire family being a goody-goody but then you eat a weed brownie imagine the things that are going through your mind my the thing that also made it worse is that I ate the entire brownie and they're like you're only supposed to eat like a quarter of it I thought I was gonna overdose but then later I just accepted it and I was just like it was a fun experience I was just like goofing around we were prank calling it was really fun yeah but then so what happened was they all went downstairs and I and my cousin Eli was in the room he has the same name is me he was the same room as me and he told me those aren't we friends those aren't rebirths so my first because like at the time I was like oh you know I was like I pursue me I wasn't high they tricked me I should have been smart enough when I saw the packaging said Walmart but I wasn't smart like that so I was in denial I was like no good why do I feel all the sensations of getting high no I wasn't high they tricked me those little tricksters Eastside Sanchez I Gabi Medina and um Jennifer for the last name they treat me in Savannah tours they tricked me into thinking that I ate a weed brownie in that entire experience I was quaking I didn't know what I so I thought I was high but I was not high it was all in my imagination I wasn't high so that was pretty embarrassing this is the first story time it's crazy I felt the tree my my but when I look at it back I'm glad it happened because it was pretty funny and I get a cool little click Beatty video to upload Thanks", "-fWfip8_nkA": "hi and welcome to Kara basics today we learn five easy ways to use cannabis vegetable glycerin tincture marijuana vegetable glycerin or VG tincture is a thick sweet and usually golden to dark brown color tincture which has the amazing capability to allow THC to mix easily into water-based liquids there are several ways of making vegetable glycerin tinctures some involving the cannabis and VG sitting for months on end others use heat to speed the extraction and sometimes alcohol is used to extract the THC which is then combined into the vegetable glycerin we'll put links to some of these methods at the end of the video and in the description but no matter how you make or acquire your tincture here are five easy ways to put it to good use one of the easiest ways to use your vegetable glycerin tincture is to make jello with it you can use it one small package of jell-o and make it just for the directions and once you pour your jello into your boiling water you want to mix that make sure it's thoroughly mixed and then go ahead and add in your vegetable glycerin tincture for one small package of jell-o depending on the potency of your tincture one tablespoon is probably enough next step is to go ahead and make sure that you've fully incorporated and by that I mean really really mixed the hell out of it and makes your VG in there and then now you're going to go ahead and get a cup of cold water ready I like to do that by pouring a water over ice and then using the ice to water and then combine the one cup of cold water with the one cup of hot water and again mix it very thoroughly and making sure that we get that tincture mixed all the way through as much as possible and then as per the directions of the jello put that in the refrigerator for about three or four hours and you're gonna have a nice marijuana infused dessert treat that you can hardly at all even taste the cannabis in this if you use that ratio it's very transparent a nice way to get a small dose of the vegetable glycerin tincture and it really helps if you have a sore throat of anything and that jello next up we have fruit juice because the vegetable glycerin tincture allows the cannabis to become soluble in water you don't really even need heat or anything like that to be able to mix it into a water-based drink such as this is a watermelon drink here but you could use pretty much any kind of drink that you want or a smoothie and just simply take the cap off depending on how much you're gonna put in you might need to take one drink out to make a little room but I've only put about a teaspoon in this and I didn't need to take any room out but just make sure you shake it thoroughly and again now you just want to make sure you incorporate it good so you don't get all of your tincture in one drink so you don't want to shake it a minute or so and then if you let it sit for very long between drinks you'll want to shake it up between each each sort of session okay and conversely as well as you could add it to cold drinks you can also add it to hot drinks so the third method we're showing here is to add it to a cup of tea but of course you could also use coffee and you could also even use a cup of hot cocoa but especially if you're using tea what you want to do is you want to make sure that you go ahead and let your tea steep fully and then go ahead add in your any other flavorings such as honey or lemon or whatever you're adding in and then add the tincture and last and you certainly don't want to add your tincture in first because it's gonna absorb into your tea bag so make sure that you've taken your tea bag out squeezed it out added anything else and then add your tincture and last again mix it thoroughly I like to use the dipping spoon to mix it when it's hot it'll melt all the takes you right off there you've got a nice marijuana infused cup of tea or coffee or cocoa [Music] okay and the next method is to make silly syrup and what silly syrup is is basically taking any kind of syrup or honey I would recommend real maple syrup but I'm just using kind of just cheap breakfast syrup here which has a very similar consistency to the vegetable glycerin tincture and not adding in a ratio I would say at least two to one but you probably want to go maybe even four to one for parts syrup to one part of the vegetable glycerin texture then once you have it combined mix it well again and you can store it just like it is for on the counter for as long as you could store the syrup usually but the one thing is you wouldn't want to make sure that you thoroughly shake or mix it each time before you use it but once it's made you could use it just like you would any other kind of syrup I'm putting it over some waffles here with some melting butter and it's delicious again the artificial maple flavoring and this syrup totally disguised that a pretty large amount of cannabis tincture that was in there you didn't even notice that at all and it's a really effective way to to get your medicine into you on a daily basis without smoking or causing any further harm to you and it's a nice subtle way to do it the only thing about this especially in the syrups or anything like that you want to make sure you label it and keep it out of reach of children if you make any of these kinds of recipes that would sit around and then she could use on in and then our fifth and final method here is to use it as an e-cig juice a lot of people don't know that this vegetable glycerin tincture will just vape perfectly right inside of your ecigs cigarette device and you just however you fill your device normally you just put in the tincture I use a little syringe with the the big needles which is used for that and it's perfect and it vapes good it tastes good you could add in some flavorings some lemon or some pine or whatever flavor you might want to flavor up your tincture but it's great just as it is this episode of cata basics

this [ __ ] i'm not a drinker bro but look at this [ __ ] you got tequila tequila and rum bro and look it's like 60 shots bro this [ __ ] is so crazy cause look three cups of vodka or tequila bro it's out of a jar cuz stop playing bro that [ __ ] will be so amazing bro i'm really thinking of drinking something like this on christmas i mean on new year's day i remember the time whenever i told you about that like bill gates and [ __ ] that he was trying to make the vaccines and stuff all right look this is the video that i was talking about the side effects for the modern vaccine sound concerning we looked after the second dose at least 80 percent of participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers so are these vaccines safe well the uh the fda not being pressured will look hard at that the fda is the gold standard of regulators uh and their current guidance on this if they stick with that is is very very appropriate uh and you know the the the side effects were not super severe that is it didn't cause permanent health problems for uh the things there they you know modernity did have to go with the fairly high dose and so uh you know to get the antibodies some of the other vaccines uh are going able to go with lower doses to get uh responses that are are pretty high including the j j and the pfizer and so there's a lot of characteristics of these vaccines um it's great that we have multiple of them uh that are going out there and yes you know the data better than i do but the bill though the data that everybody with a high dose had a side effect yeah but some of that is is not dramatic where you know it's just you know super painful but yes there we need to make sure there's not severe side effects the fda uh i i think will do a good job of that uh despite the pressure here we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're uh most at risk of that and doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects you know if we have you know one in ten thousand uh side effects that's you know way more 700 000 uh you know people who will suffer from that so really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age rent ranges you know pregnant male female undernourished uh existing comorbidities it's very very hard and that actual decision of okay let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world uh governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can uh be decided on she was thank you mom she didn't love me back i'm literally on my fourth one having your camp experiences maybe they have cake surprise is a five [ __ ] brownies cuz oh my gosh [ __ ] let's get the

from wherever's freak she got the brownies from and he tells me to eat some and you know me like I'm not super big on sweets if you know me so he gives me the brownie I meant the brownies or chocolate got a little chocolate pieces in the looking room yum yum and I take a little piece of the brown I eat the brownie and you know I didn't feel anything because I didn't know that I was supposed to like how long it was supposed to say a little piece of the brownie brownie was freaking super good a little bit more a little bit more got to the hotel room was still fun like my normal little page itself a little bit more and I pretty much ate more than half of the brownie I pretty much ate the entire brownie except for like a little piece like this he gets in the shower he could start the showers

[Music] and I thought I was gonna pass out like I was in there and I was just feeling like I wasn't feeling like myself and I literally forgot that I even had ate the weed brownie so in my mind I thought I was just getting sick like I didn't eat all day I'm like maybe cuz I didn't eat I'm a got dehydrated like I really didn't know what it was and why was for like that and he looked at me and he just named like he's like are you okay are you okay so you just got calmed down like like you calm down it's all in your head and I'm seeing here like no [ __ ] these walls are closing in on me

so I mean I don't think it's necessary to leave their Instagram it's I'm gonna leave on the screen instead of down below but it's at the trail bakery on Instagram and so crazy story they actually see my video it wasn't like a sponsor video I didn't like tag them or anything they've seen the video I guess somebody sent it to them and they gave me a 15% discount code so your girl is situated because you know she put them she put them out there on YouTube so this time I have a rice krispies treat with like little sprinkles in them and I'm going to be doing my makeup but backwards you know there's always a twist to it I'm really trying to stay away from like makeup videos because I literally do my own everyday makeup routine all the time it might get ready of me to check everything means Queen combos I do the same thing so I decided to add a little twist to it it's gonna be me doing my maker booty but backwards and we're gonna see how it looks so I know it's gonna bust much a lot see it's gonna bust my skull Lottie because I don't know how to think properly when I eat an edible so me having to think about like what steps are next yo I know I'm a mess up and y'all wanted to see more edible videos so that's what I'm bringing feel like or now we roll to 100k period anyways um let's start en and yahoodi or me in the comments talking about wow I didn't even have to rip it like what just rip this pretty packaging y'all be on me in the comments talk about I take little bites I eat my food with it like taking little bites that's just me I'm not scared to eat the edible I just take little bites why not feel concerned about the the size bites that I take huh why our cages let me rock so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna eat the Egg Bowl and then come back in like thirty minutes because these edibles for some reason take longer than the ones I had for the first time well not for the first time but for the make up edible video so since II take a long time I'm not about to start until I start feeling something and start twitching and glitching and stumbling and tumbling so we don't eat I don't know how much time and we just eat mmm smell good tastes good nice and crispy and the shipping did not take long at all it took about three days like I don't want to miss out on this opportunity some bangin edibles don't buy edibles from no random get it from the website like websites are more trustworthy anyways so y'all know I always get carried away when I ietter bulls because if you tasted Maggie I just rescued a watermelon style past kids those are amazing you're I'm really eating this like it's not about to tell me I'm over here Dave Jimmy that's not good this tastes so I'm gonna leave it at this cuz that's a good size I think I ate a good amount and now I'm gonna start pre-planning the steps because I know I'm a mess up and end up looking bad and I'm actually trying to look good so I'll be back in like 20 30 no 30 35 minutes Oh since I'm very forgetful and I know this is probably not gonna go well I wrote down the steps of the makeup that I do solvated like 45 minutes and I feel something let's introduce our snacks today so whatever I gotcha I'm bad

thumbs up to your post notify me when I'm seeing my next video bye", "JCGKw4lkVgc": "okay any other deep questions you want to ask before we start this video it's already started welcome to Angel's anything show we have a very exciting video or here we're recording it guerilla style we have damned a man buying a camera now I want to show you guys what I have going here come I have weed whose disabilities I have this isn't sake I have weed graham crackers and foil I'll bring it back up to me if you know oh no you're not even oh here you go ready the final most important ingredient peanut butter if you know you know what am i making tonight folks I'm making the fire now back up a little bit basically what I'm making tonight is called the fire cracker now I have made this in college before we didn't call the fire cracker we just called it a way to take a small amount of lead and get as [ __ ] up as possible basically this is like the world's easiest quickest and most dangerous edible all you need is like a graham cracker peanut butter and weed and foil in an oven and you're gonna be able to make this edible and get so high you're gonna see ghosts I did this in college ones when I was really sick and I couldn't smoke weed and she said I was like I'll make this very very very powerful edible I ended up getting so high I called my sister crying she came to pick me up from college in a blizzard I had to take in completes in all of my classes because I couldn't finish the semester and I actually was almost dying I had pneumonia and like had to get on to steroids and [ __ ] but the point is this is not for [ __ ] children okay I haven't done it since then and I'm pretty sure Jackie did this once and she actually hallucinate it so here we go I'm gonna do it now dan one of these is just for you cuz I figured you'd want one they're very good like you don't know a good graham cracker these are good okay so the average dose is a gram but that's like if you want to like see ghosts so I do want to see ghosts I would like to see my father tonight I'm just getting ready but I got scared as I was doing this because I weighed out of Graham and I was like [ __ ] it and I turned a little bit out so it's probably closer to 0.7 so really all you do I'm hesitant to turn because my profile so just follow my hands okay all you're doing is taking these okay then you just slather slather slather the most important the most important part is to cover both crackers with peanut butter because you need the peanut butter and the weed to be touching on both sides because the fat in the peanut butter is what is gonna activate the THC in the oven so the THC the weed is like D carbon in the oven but it's d carving into the peanut butter bonding to the fat and bonding to your [ __ ] skull and that is why you get so [ __ ] up feel like I'm watching Bill Nye the Science Guy a weed girl okay sprinkle it sprinkle it now you can put as much weed as you want on here you know you can you can put Keefe on here is that enough do I need to have more feel like it's a lot you know I gotta be honest even the smell of this is bringing back memories that I don't want to have brought back and then I'm just gonna kind of do you have this do you have this so then I just go through and they need to kind of bond each side almost like you're cocking that your cockpit day in your life I'm not haven't cocked ringing up but I'm cocked mm-hmm and when you feel that you've sealed it and bonded it you just you know it's a peanut butter cracker but you don't want to send this off - can you record me it's not a [ __ ] interesting if you just record the phone the whole time am I in the shot these are like peanut butter crackers but you don't want to set them with little giant to school okay this ain't no lunchable now you want to pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees and once it's fully preheated you're gonna put this in for 25 to 30 I'm gonna do 25 because our oven runs kind of hot right and I'm gonna show you me eating it afterward so that you don't think I'm lying and then I'll show you the aftermath but yeah firecracker and it goes come on follow me the oven here we go wish me luck all right guys it's 25 minutes later and this baby is out of the oven and nice weed aroma is coming from it and now it's our moment of truth yeah so I just spent like five [ __ ] full minutes trying to focus the inside of this cracker but it's not focusing so all you need to know is that it looks like we've inside focus I don't know I'm sweating tits in this vest I can't explain the backstory in this video well alright no no eat this I'll let you know what happens who's ooh okay we're back so this edible what I forgot about this edible was that not only does it make you so [ __ ] high which yes it also makes you pretty nauseous left I forgot everybody very nauseous it's like a very well the ride of nausea but I was on the phone my friend getting so high and what he knew you know but it was good that I was talking to him because it forced me to breathe through the nausea and the highness and didn't know you're fine and otherwise I would apologize like passed out on the couch so I am very high I was way higher before and it was crazy I mean it definitely he it definitely launched me the Firecracker launched me into another to another place so I would say you definitely try it at home try it at home use lots of weaves if you want Okaloosa name alright thanks for watching some severe until sightings show see you next time bye hello we're back it's hours later I don't know if you can tell so you're about to fall off the bed", "gS33fXqIBqU": "now this next question can revert to smoking or any type of drug but when someone gets high not every high as a good high sometimes there are bad highs have you ever experienced a horror high story of that experience while you were high that was a great question because I have went to LA once again LA is deaf went out there on a shoot me and my man cooling hit the plug for you know me a little widow and oh you know he hitting us with the edibles in the note of the lemonade and all that he liked easy online trainings popping these little gummy bears and all he like bro man is this let me do what I do you feel me going crazy bro that probably was the worst thing I could have ever done in my life that I was and then you keep going high so you keep going high and high and high and you like are you even gonna come down my home he was in the whip with me doing the same thing Costra phobic hopped out the car took his shirt yo I can't do it man I'm like damn we lost one but overall like after hours and hours and hours on in the high starts to settle but when you get that high I didn't think you could get that high but when you get that high it's like literally like an out-of-body kind of experience man never again those smalls no edibles for me when it comes to edibles people have to understand somebody watching this they have to know how much they can take of that in one sitting for their body mm-hmm and not every person could take the same amount food acts and for somebody doing it the first time the stuff that the edible is mixed with tastes so good that you're not thinking about it it may just be like okay if you're having a cereal bar now it's laced with some sort of medicinal it's just going to taste like a cereal bar you know till it kicks in and if you took too much you experience what you experienced and they keep the and see the thing too small is it kicks in about two three hours later but it you don't pop some after that it just keep cuz this in your bloodstream your dick so once you start floating you know Casper five you know you're like man when I'm not coming down so it could be a little scary sometimes you dick and it's a high that has no turn off switch so you hear and you ain't coming down to lick your body really just thought yeah I'm saying you can actually some people think they can sleep it off sometimes that high can be so serious that you can wake up and you're still high now when it comes to being high and the munchies are in play that's when you get a craving for something to eat while you're under the influence whether you can have it at that point or not what's at the top of your list is there some some wigs what up though may I need to hit me you know I'm plugging y'all land on as small as tip you feel me but Twix man I got a had a tweak a Twix in the Gatorade I'm Gucci I don't your guy eat nothing knows is it a certain flavor carry yeah I love the UM the purple joy I don't know what flavor that is great so I'm like that but it's incredible I like that you", "QZOoVxEdgPE": "you ready you guys freaking ready you

found you eat the [ __ ] vs 20 minutes later", "yNzCS_5ACzs": "so today I'm gonna show you how to make edible brownies if you know what I mean you know edible brownies so what you want to do is preheat the oven to 350 degrees is that's what the box says you just take any box of freaking like brownies and I am not endorsing this cheap brand I think this came from might save a lot or something like that but any box any regular box preheat the oven to 350 degrees and you get the ingredients ingredients says 1/4 cup of water then you get 2/3 cup of vegetable oil we're gonna end up cooking the oil with the treats inside so you want to do a little bit more than what they suggest you to get so this says 2/3 we're just gonna do a whole cup of oil and we're gonna put that in there turn this right I had this dough for about uh I had to stove for about 6 months now and I still don't know which burner is which so I've got about a cup of oil in here that I'm just going to pour here and let that my herbal ingredients in here so what you want to do is just take that and you just want to kinda like grind it up if you have one of those grinders that'll work not the app but the actual herb grinder that'll work you're gonna smell it in the air so I would suggest not doing it at work or not doing it and somebody's house me you don't want the aroma to be in the air but you know so yeah you just want to let that marinate and the oil if you will for a little bit so in the meantime you want to gather the other ingredients mixing bowl just pour the content of the box into a mixing bowl this this particular box says grab two labels so we have that set to the side just dump that in the mixing bowl like so it says two eggs right yea it says 2 to 8 we prepped that in there I already smell it and it says 1/4 cup of water we just won't give that up sterasyl make sure is the continents evenly spread it throughout the oil so that when you bite into the brownie it's a little bit of the urban everybody just cook this till it starts changing colors and in the meantime you can get you a regular pan like this aluminum pan this one is used already but I'm gonna use it again because I got money to waste this market so I'm gonna dry it out make sure it already dry you want to then grease that I usually just take some oil take a little bit of oil going in the bottom take another paper towel and just don't cry you just spread the oil around that aroma is really in the air [Music] so I'm gonna continue to boil or cook whatever you will what about another minute or so that's pretty much done so the reason why I put a little bit more of oil in there because when you do this some of the oil is going to I guess dry up a bamboo root or whatever so you can pour it back in here till you get your 2/3 walk like they wanted and with the flakes and everything you just poured it to you better begin to stir it makes it to me it's like this when that's done take your pan and you just just make sure this evenly you take your finger yeah I taste it now this says who so I guess I want to bake it for about I don't know what 25 30 minutes so that's where we're gonna put it in oven now and we're just gonna wait 30 minutes so we're back and it's been about 30 minutes so we're going to take these off the oven want this out the oven and smell that aroma in the air yes that's it oh so that's how that looks looks good right so I'm gonna try and see if it gives me the effect that I desire all right well that's another video make sure you hit the subscribe button the notification

CB puff and stuff here today we are going to go ahead and make some brownies using the can of butter that we made in the previous video we're going to start out of course the the brownie mix here calls for greasing the pan so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to break into this tub of cannabutter that we made the other day is it set up here and I'm going to use this to grease the bottom of our pan get in all the little corners and get the whole bottom covered good then you're gonna want to work up the sides get all the way up the sides you don't want your brownies sticking in your baking dish all right there we go let that sit now we've got a greased baking dish for making our brownies so as we get started here we're gonna make two boxes of Duncan Hines chewy fudge brownies we're just gonna double the recipe that's on the back of the box here we're gonna follow the directions instead of adding vegetable oil here that's where we're going to put in our can of butter so just follow the instructions exactly and we will add in our can of butter instead of vegetable oil so break open the first box and pour the mix in so he's got to pre-heat your oven to 350 we've already got our oven preheated all right now the next thing that says here is emptier brownie mix eggs water and oil canna butter in a large bowl so we're gonna add our eggs we're gonna add in four eggs each recipe calls for two eggs so we're gonna add in four eggs here you there's three eggs we've got one left yeah see if I can be fancy here and do it one-handed oh look at that there we go bada boom bada bing now we add the water all right now that we got our butter softened we're gonna go ahead and pour that right in here trying to get as much of that butter in there as you can don't want to waste it electric mixer here and I'm gonna mix it in real quick you don't want to mix it too much just get all of the batter mixed in you all right there we go just mixed in not over beaten clean these beaters off a little bit here set those aside we'll just goes right in there now we can go ahead and put our mix in it's nice and mixed just go ahead and put it right into the pan here all right set that bowl aside and we'll spread this into the pan here you now that that's done some special person gets to lick the bowl and the spoon will be very happy the rest of the day so now the brownies are ready to go in the oven we will put them in the oven and bake them according to the time on the box which is 21 to 23 minutes we'll check them at that and see if they need more time well these are in the oven let's talk a little bit about dosages for edibles using a 10 percent THC content for an average not saying that's what we have we could have more we could have less just depends but for an average is what we're going for at 10 percent each gram of dried flour contains 100 milligrams of THC in my previous video making cannabutter I use 28 grams of dried flower to put in my butter so that equals 20 800 milligrams of THC in 1 pound of butter divide that 2800 by 4 you get 700 milligrams in 1 cup of butter that's what we used in our brownies so you're getting a batch of brownies that has 700 milligrams of THC in in one batch divide that by however many brownies you get in your batch I'm gonna say for example purposes I'm going to say 36 brownies in this batch that puts us at 20 milligrams per brownie 20 milligrams per brownie is double what Colorado State allows legally in their edibles for sale so imagine that one brownie twice the milligrams that should set you pretty good our timer just went off so let's check these and see they're done [Music] as you can see by the toothpick they are far from done so we'll set the timer for about another 20 minutes or so and see what happens next alrighty here we are 44 minutes total we're pulling these brownies out of the oven to make sure they're done see they're nice and done a little bit of stick is down there but that's alright we like our brownies a little chewy so this concludes brownie making with cannabutter I hope you guys enjoy your brownies and as always have a smokin day [Music] [Music]", "ohxDUez4AoI": "real quick before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "6Q5hQf98mBg": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to my channel welcome if you're new here my name is Ariana and I recently got an airfryer and I could not stop using it I love my airfryer and I love edibles so I was like what if I made like edibles in my air fryer would that be crazy I decided to make firecrackers because they seemed fast and easy and kind of classic I've never had them before so I'm very excited and that's pretty much it be sure to LIKE comment subscribe and follow me on Instagram and enjoy the video oh my god yes so I have all of my ingredients in front of me I have some graham crackers some hazelnut spread anything high in fat apparently will do I have a Pyrex container you'll see why in a moment and the last thing you need is some lead I have some strawberry banana shake here today I'm gonna weigh out and grind up like maybe a gram I'm gonna do it well okay so I ground my wheat up and now I'm gonna put it in this dish I usually should put the wheat and oil but something is telling me to put it in a pyrex dish I think if I were to just put this inside like a pocket of foil it would probably fly around in the airfryer so I don't want to do that so I want it to be all like evenly spread out and I'm gonna try and toast it you feel me and I'm going to put some foil on top and poke holes in it so it doesn't fly around and the air doesn't circulate all over the place okay okay so I'm poking the holes in so it doesn't kind of fly around everywhere or explode so I'm gonna just poke it up I think that's probably good right we don't know we're experimenting we're being cute okay let's set the airfryer so I'm gonna see how low it can go I usually would put it about I want to say like oh it only goes to 300 I would usually do carbon at around 240 but it's given us 300 so we've got 300 but we're still gonna do it because I do what I want just place it right in just like there you go nice and cute so I'm gonna pop her back in now this 300 degrees kinda has me [ __ ] up I had a whole plan and now I don't have a plan at all so I'm going to do 300 degrees should I do airfryer or should I do like roast Oh roast those lower okay okay oh it's illegal it's 250 you know what 250 is fine feeling more confident so I'm going to do I think I'm gonna do about 10 minutes okay okay I'll be back I'm scared I'll be back I hope you guys can hear me over the airfryer hopefully I'm going to begin to set up the actual firecrackers while I'm waiting I'm putting down two cuz I want to like sandwich it you feel me I actually hate graham crackers but it has wheat inside of it so it can't be all that bad you know I'm slathering this all I'm like I want it to be nice and just juicy and ready for the show I've got about five minutes remaining but I want to say now there's not a smell so far the first five minutes I'm not seeing a big stinky waft but I'll be back to let you know I feel like it might not get that bad so I'll be right back see you in four minutes okay here we go okay looks a little toasted I think I might put it in a little bit longer actually no I'm gonna wait I'm gonna put the firecracker in for like 15 minutes so I'm gonna pull this out and we're gonna set it all up definitely smells roasted but it's not brown enough in my opinion hopefully putting it inside of the sandwich will really help things it smells kind of roasted so I'm getting kind of excited it might actually work you know just gonna Pat a bit of that in you feeling just a little pat up I think this might work it's so crazy that it might work this really might I might have you starting something so I'm gonna sandwich it little sandwich don't comment on my nails because like [ __ ] you I'm in quarantine mind your own [ __ ] business okay I'm gonna just wrap around we're just gonna wrap it up like let's not dilly-dally I'm tired of explaining okay we have our little graham cracker pocket I'm gonna pop it back in this bowl just because I don't want to make a mess or anything so I lied and end up putting it into this basket because I figured that it was probably easier that way when it's the heat up evenly so we're gonna put it right in the basket and I'm putting it back at 250 and we're going to see what happens girl so I put it back on a roast and I'm thinking like 15 minutes I'm gonna do 15 minutes and I'll be back okay oh my god it begins flying around okay okay okay okay let's figure this out okay I'm putting its seal side down this time let's see what's up okay okay that sounds fine okay I'll be back in 15 okay smell check it's been about 15 minutes almost and I'm not smelling anything I'm smelling like Nutella obviously but it does not smell weedy I'm very very shocked it's almost trying to pop it out though girl I'm [ __ ] excited I'm high okay should I like let it cool down probably not I'm probably not gonna do it okay let's unwrap it let's see what's up okay okay it's not really smelling oh okay oh wow that's so cool did I do it wait let me open it is it leg D carb wait it's like brown on the inside like the wheat is brown did this warm up it's hot as [ __ ] a little let it cool but I think you worked what okay so I wanted to bring it closer so it's toasted and the inside looks like this it looks kind of like house I think supposed to look based on other YouTube tutorials I'm gonna just eat it that's just [ __ ] meaning honestly but hopefully it gets me high right Cheers Wow it's hot oh my god I [ __ ] home it doesn't taste very lady at all actually it's kind of good one problem I need some water this [ __ ] is hot it's so sweet dude oh my god alright second half down hmm I'm not sure if I have you carved the weed enough here's how the wee looks inside like before it looks roasted honestly it smells roasted it smells like SD card but probably could have gone a bit longer but if I cooked it longer it might have burned a bit so I don't know I don't know alright she's done okay it's 426 I'll be back at like 5:00 5:30 to see if I'm higher now so I'll be back okay so it's about 5:43 and I definitely have some thoughts and opinions so I'm definitely stoned like pretty stoned however I feel like I could be higher I was looking it up on reddit and I think that I could have done two things differently I could have one day use flour instead of shape just premium top shelf flour and I probably should have roasted it about 5 or 10 minutes longer I am feeling pretty high though I have a pretty good body high I'm feeling pretty giggly I wonder what will happen in about like another hour so I might check in but I'm definitely feeling something I would call this a success however I need to make some tweaks you know what I mean I'm gonna smoke a boat with you before I go though because I want to smoke some more going to finish this off and I'm going to bid you adieu [ __ ] what'd I do it again yes what I recommend is yes definitely try it let me know how you feel I really enjoyed this journey and I love my

[ __ ] um know but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] sit down and pop these open and then just give them a try but yeah let's just sit down alright guys we're currently sitting down now um it is currently 10 30 so i'm on i'm gonna be on some crackhead [ __ ] and just taking these [ __ ] edibles hella early i haven't ate anything so i'm gonna be on an empty stomach and we're just gonna see how

happen big i don't know when or how the [ __ ] is gonna happen but i know i'm gonna do this [ __ ] [ __ ] big um so we're just gonna [ __ ] keep going um i don't know what i'm gonna do for 1k but i'll i'll see if i end up doing anything but we're just gonna celebrate that [ __ ] honestly um i remember just calling that [ __ ] out and it just [ __ ] happened but back to the [ __ ] um it'll rebuke edible review i just wanted to [ __ ] talk to you guys and just say thank you to you guys real quick um but let's just pop this [ __ ] open oh [ __ ] i hate ripping [ __ ] all stupid um but now it's just early as [ __ ] and i'm eating candy and [ __ ] not even just candy [ __ ] edibles but and then they're sour as [ __ ] too well i'm guessing yourself but this is what they look like how many are in here so i got one two so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if you guys enjoyed this video hit that subscribe button also hit that bell notification she doesn't get notified when i drop more gems more bangers all my videos are gems they're only getting better and better so if you don't [ __ ] with them now trust me they're only

decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "bekkQ9Wm8zs": "[Music] my girlfriend's going over the property act we was talking about being held above all talk about everybody's first water than my teeth

your sanity [Music]", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "p08uZaxNrVM": "the sweet success of this thriving small business zeroing in on the magic of brownies and the power of giving back take a look i love making people happy when they come to the dessert truck or even when they order our brownies online it's nothing like someone being super happy about getting brownies or even having a cup of coffee women's history month means to me you know we are striving i think we've made so much so much progress but we have so much further to go i started my journey in 1996 at the beginning of the internet age during my undergraduate degree i was diagnosed with dyslexia i was tested really late in life and you know i had a point where i wasn't going to graduate from college because my gpa was so low but once i was able to get assessed by the disabled student services organization and then i was able to work with the university to lift some of those f's or replace them with other courses i was baking brownies as a thank you gift for someone who helped me get a job they really like them and just kind of fast forward i revisited that recipe and realized i transposed that recipe without knowing i had dyslexia i started the company with the notion of thinking i really wanted to make people happy i really enjoy that and i thought well you know i have this done in love and my parents bought it for me when i was like two or three years old and you know this is how i used to write love and the logo was based off my handwriting and then i was thinking brownie shaped like hearts how fun is that and so i started doing more research and realized you know i've never been done so i just started going down that path i would like my legacy to be with love's brownies and my scholarship foundation i was adopted i decided that the grit scholarship reward was worth me giving back to my community i've had so much support within my community and as i think about growing my family i adopted my son as a single parent and i should just hope that he would want to carry on this legacy of just thinking about others as they go through their journeys so my scholarship fund will be given out for the first time this year to three applicants up to 500 high school seniors who have just shown not only grades right but with community service more goes into a person more than just grades i'm looking for individuals that were just like me who have shown grit wow you gotta love just what she's accomplished and how she's giving back to her community and we're going to be sampling this later in the commercial break so that's a big thank you yes thank you", "8ID6ayefO4Q": "[Music] [Music] hello and welcome back to hello hi and today we're cooking red velvet chocolate chip cookies white chocolate chips and we're adding a sprinkle of regular chocolate chips only because i ran out of white chocolate chips but let me show you how these cookies look inside do you see how moist those cookies are we are making these today so we're using can of butter and duncan hines cake mix for everyone who's not a baker this recipe is for you so let's get started for this recipe you only need four ingredients one box of red velvet cake mix two eggs a cup and a half of white chocolate chips and a third cup of can of butter and if you want it really strong go ahead and bump it up to a half a cup and before we start make sure you preheat your oven to 350 degrees and if you haven't already subscribe to my channel and give this video a thumbs up below in a large bowl combine the cake mix eggs can of butter and chocolate chips and start stirring them together but be careful if you drop an eggshell like i just did take it out keep on going i use a folding motion with my spatula to combine the ingredients to make sure i don't over mix the batter because you will be tempted to use a mixer when that batter starts to become heavy but try not to use a mixer unless you have a folding attachment because it'll over mix the batter and result in flatter crispier cookies make sure you mix the batter for about 5 to 10 minutes until it's well combined or you don't see any more of the cake mixture your batter should look like this when you're ready to make your cookies okay now it's time to put the cookies on the cookie sheet now i have a martha stewart cookie sheet but if you don't have a martha stewart cookie sheet or a sheet a cookie sheet that has a silicone lining please line your um cookie sheet pan with parchment paper or they'll stick to the pan so you i have a well i did have a ice cream scooper but i can't find it one of those things that walk away in the kitchen and you just don't know where it is so today i'm using a one tablespoon to scoop the cookie dough and put it on the sheet you don't want to take these cookies and ball them up with your hands because as you can see they're very sticky so you don't want to use your hands you definitely want to use ice cream scooper or a one tablespoon measuring spoon to get the cookie dough out you want to make sure the balls are big enough so when you cook they're nice and thick and don't come out flat so don't be stingy when scooping that cookie dough okay now that we're done we're going to put these in the oven for about 12 minutes on 350 and then come back and take out our cookies and see how they came out i can't wait for y'all to see these cookies okay everybody the cookies are out of the oven and i can't wait for you to see them look at those cookies they look so good i'm not going to try one because i already tasted the dough and i already know that they are strong but you go ahead and make these cookies um it tastes great and thank you guys for watching again don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you can see more cannabis recipes and i

we're gonna be showing you how easy it is to take your cannabis butter and a simple pack of box brownies and make yourself some delicious pot brownies and so right off the bat we're just gonna open this up now as you can see it actually asked for vegetable oil you can substitute pot butter for vegetable oil all you have to do is melt it first and so we've already preheated the oven to the 350 degrees like it asks for and so at this point we're just gonna open it up don't the mix in here you're gonna need some water it calls for a quarter cup of water and 1/2 cup of cannabis butter in which you've been a warm melt down the cannabis butter so it is like oil beforehand I love it that you're gonna need three eggs to three eggs if you want it to be kinky so we're going for the fudgy type brownies and so there's my quarter cup of water we're gonna do the 1/2 cup and I'm gonna mix this up because there's a lot of keep in there and stuff if you go over a little it's okay but try to be kind of accurate so they're not too oily don't pin your cannabis butter I like to really get it in there we're gonna waste any of that crack your little eggs Bam's now we're going to just simply mix this up make sure to get it all thoroughly mixed now as part of the preparation while I'm mixing this I'm gonna show you the reused parchment paper and we've actually layered it because a lot of people find when you make brownies the trick is a lot of times the brownies when you're done cooking they're actually hard to get out of the pan they get tore up because for some reason pot brownies are excellent and becoming very sticky and so as you can tell we're mix this thoroughly don't have any of those clumps in there so make sure you really really mix it good because nobody likes roasted nuts to be honest and so and if you don't know how cannabis butter or if you want to know how we do actually have a video then we'll show you how to make your own butter and so if you do need to go ahead and watch that get your pot butter ready before you like you know get this far so now that's done like that I am simply going to layer this down into the bottom making sure to crush up any more of that dry stuff and we're gonna squash this down in here make sure you get it all out because you don't want to be wasting any of this deliciousness and that's potentially cutting your shelves short be tragedy on the box we're only cooking it let's see for about 25 to 27 minutes then we'll probably go 26 minutes meet it in the middle and we'll pull these out after they're done so after you're done cooking it you're gonna fool your pan of brownies out it's gonna look gorgeous just like that and you're gonna let it cool just a little bit so it can harden up firm up a little bit and then you're gonna just be able to grab it by the paper pull it out and drop it onto your cooling rack and so if you've never made pot brownies before it is actually that easy and so hope this helps you out

lovely people so I just wanted to do a quick update and review of stony patch stony patch edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below and I will get back to you of course yeah and have a good one here", "KhpIoBOLObI": "hey everybody this is a video for how to make your own AV b or ABV Cannell that means already vaped bud or already been vaped and you can actually use this method to make your own like cannabis oil or butter with with d carbs stuff too you can just get some some flour and d kharbut yourself but this stuff here in particular is with my vape like vaporizer leftovers so I'll show you how to do that couple people asked me to make this video so I said sure why not so anyways this is just some of my stuff that I had that I made last time my last batch so I started to show you that they're made quite a bit last time there but this time we're gonna do it a little bit differently has always changed every single time I do it so always a little bit different so I'm recording this separately than the video I already actually recorded the video and I was dubbing over in here now so there's me putting the bowl on my thing and weighing up the my all my scraps they're from the vaporizer I'm gonna just to make sure I know how much I have here so what do we got there seven so I have a couple containers I got a dump in here in a second it's pretty cool how it comes out it looks like these little like sand castles made of Av B sand castles anyways what do we got here I think it's like 50 you can use a BB or whatever or you can also if you D carve your own stuff that's you know you can use that here too but you have to always do that first unless you vaped it already you have to deke arbiter if you vaped it you've already de carb\u00f3n so this next step is optional I'm gonna be doing a water wash in this one so all you need some water oh not that water no no no not that stuff what we need is this distilled water that's the stuff we need alright so we got the distilled water and we got the reason I think you need to stilled water for what people say is because it sort of leeches more of the shitty taste stuff in whatever else out of the way so I have this coffee grinder that I'm gonna use I'm gonna put the stuff in here and I'm gonna soak it in water to soak some of the shitty stuff oh and don't worry because all the THC and all that stuff is not water-soluble so it won't mix with the water sort of like how you know oil doesn't mix with water it's like that but it will mix with other oil so for now we're just gonna mix it with some water and this whole part is optional you don't have to do this but if you do this whole sort of thing it will get rid of a lot of the shitty taste so I always like to try things differently it's just to see you know just to keep always try every single time I make this let me get slightly different so you know I'm always trying things just to see what works best so this is the my most recent one here here we go with the distilled water dump it some of this straight in there it goes in kind of weird sometimes you have to sort of well you don't really have to mix it around because if you're using a coffee grinder you don't really have to that's what makes it nice is you have the filter of this the French press and it'll hold it all underneath the water because you don't want it above the water you want it all under the water so that's why these things are so handy because you can just hold it down you just push it down a bit it'll hold it down there see all the stuff floating around in there it'll all sort of settle after a while so usually you would do this you'd soak it with the water and you leave it for a while and you know you leave it for a few hours even for half like a quarter of a day a third of a day something like that and then you come back and then you check the water again or you can change it after that notice the water is no longer clear it's all kind of shitty coloured like piss it's piss coloured see right here I'm just sort of squishing it down you'll have to squish it hard I'm just pushing it down just a bit and I'm gonna pull this thing up and usually if you wait I'll probably do like a fast-forward video or something maybe that I'll show it but if you wait it'll slowly float up on its own and as it floats up it'll give it a nice sort of mix so you have to like do anything crazy with it and at the top there with the filter you want to have that so that the thing is always everything is underwater you want to have it above the water see everything's floating up it's kind of neat it's it's actually kind of fun doing this it's kind of like a lava lamp yeah this one didn't float up as nice as some of them usually it'll float up and like explode in little chunks here and there I'm sure I'm one of the next steps you'll see you do that because we have to do this again here we go I've done it again I pushed it down and I just have the camera set up here trying to get it so you can see better it's all just rising up on its own look at that isn't that cool it's so neat looking and as it left lifts up like that it's kind of like mixing on its own so you have to give it a stir or anything it is wait now look how dark it is down there you can't even see through the damn thing again this whole step is optional you don't have to do any of this step oh right here I'm pointing at the top I'm showing you look at this it's all below the water alright it's been quite a while now I have a bowl here I just want to show you the color of the water and it smells horrible let me tell you it's like a tea I imagine if you drank this you probably puke everywhere but we're removing all this stuff from the from the oil that we're making right or the butter so that it'll be way less shit tasting see I've dumped it at the water now I'm coming back for the rest here we go pour it out see we're ready for another round of the water here we go distilled water again and you know like I said before this whole step this entire process part with the water of washing part is optional I like it though I've only done three times now and I think I really like it look at how it pops up there isn't that neat that's all swishing and swirling around so I just squish it down a little bit more here and as you can see it's a little like not nearly as dark as last time but you can still see that there's some yellow there and it's all going up all cool looking real neat so fun looking at this in real life it's fun to watch this once again this is part of the optional step you don't have to do this I like it though and a lot of other people really like doing this type of thing see right here I'm squishing it down in this next part I've got I pour out this disgusting nastiness again there's less this time less bad color it still smells gross not as gross though I'll see there's a couple of little bits that I you know got on the top nothing to worry about almost everything is still trapped in the bottom nicely so we're just gonna pour this same throw this away this is more just garbage water it guess what we're doing round three here we go so in between each of these rounds I will usually wait like three hours four hours sometimes even five hours I one time I left it overnight I think actually you know what I think the first one of these I left overnight I got it in the morning well look at that doesn't that look neat now it's almost clear it's all floating up all need in little chunks and exploding mix it around again this is still putter the optional stuff and I just remind you once a game you have to deke our beer weed first or if you have vaped it that is also the same thing so here we go again time to for this out this stuff is nowhere near as bad looking as last time so this is the third time I've done this I think this is the final time and after this I start doing the rest of the stuff so I pour that a pour the rest of this back in the bowl and pour this out again this someone really we want to make sure to get all the water because we didn't we don't wanna have much water in the rest of this there's the stuff sitting inside the thing there's a little pot that I like to use we're gonna use a double boiler style on this I find that to be one of the best methods and the easiest so we're gonna pull this chunky shit out of here it's all kind of gross it feels gross right now and slimy almost nuts not slimy but it feels weird it's like spongy and watery but just scoop all of that stuff out and put it in there there we go I got a whole nice big thing of that this is 50 grams almost 51 grams I think of already vaped bud we just have it in this nice little pot that I use time to weigh up some coconut oil so I've already weighed up 70 and I'm adding 95 to it here now so 70 plus 95 that's like that's like a hundred and eighty-five think so there we go I added about 20 more so now it's it's around 200 205 something like that approximately a little bit gets stuck to the bowl but plus I added a bit it should be about about that I'm just giving you a little bit of a mix here otherwise it'll just sit on top of the stuff and just um it'll then the thing will be lopsided and it may tip over inside of the double boiler thing right so we want to make sure mix it around a bit so it'll melt evenly somewhat I like to rap sort of a tinfoil around here just in case you don't want anything landing in this right just you know you never know if something might land in this plus water may splash into it maybe it'll tip over who knows right there we go putting it inside of the thing that's there the water pot the pot of water now right here I've just taken it off of the thing I've had it on there for an hour and I've taken it off taking the top off and I have a hand mixer because you know what we're gonna mix this up that'll hopefully mix it around real nice inside I used to just this is the first time I've used a mixer on this I used to always just take it off and stir it I would always recommend taking it off the stirring it every like half hour or something like that every hour every half hour but I took this off when I gave it a real good go with this mixer it's real nice if you had one of these I think this is what they're pretty good to use the fourth look at that slop mixing around down there real nice just like before we get the top back on there it's all been mixed up all nice and we're gonna put it back inside in the water again make sure your water stays up there cuz it will evaporate so make sure you keep adding some if you need to right so you gotta take it off and do this a number of times to Here I am taking it off I'm just showing this again I only record this part once but I'm just showing it again you gotta take it off and mix it every little bit and then put the top back on and put it back in the thing take it off mix it put it back on and I usually keep doing that I usually have it overall go for maybe about an hour and a half to two hours maximum on this double boiler so next I have a container to put the stuff in I have some cheesecloth and I'm gonna put this cheesecloth on here get it ready but wait a second I don't want to do that not yet so I don't know if this part is this part is optional this is something that I came up with I figured that oil goes on top of water so I'm gonna soak a bit of this in water so that it doesn't soak up a ton of oil now it's a little bit wet it's it's not super wet I've strained today or whatever squeeze it out but it will hold it should I hope have the oil go over top of it not soak up as much anyways you don't have to do that but you do have to use cheesecloth here some kind of strainer to get all this stuff out you did I separate the oil from the plant matter and whatnot and I used to always do this instantly after it was done and only recently did I figure out to wait until the oil cools a bit I would recommend waiting until the oil cools a bit so I've strained it with the through the cheesecloth into here it doesn't look too impressive right now you can see the water below there's oil it's floating on top of the water and it looks all weird but I've gotten through everything strained it all out and now and you put this in the fridge so this is the oil after you put in the fridge see the top has solidified and the bottom is still a liquid because that's all the water we don't want the water we want to get rid of that garbage [Laughter] so we're gonna pop this out and dump that shit there we go the bottom looks all gross because it's got water sort of a little bit of water or sort of with the oil kind of stuck to it or something anyways I cut this in half and you can see there's a little bit of water on the inside of this oil so anyways I cut this in half because it's solidified right so I cut it in half and I put it in here I'm just warming this up on the stove again so it turns back into oil again because there's still a bit of water stuck inside of the that was underneath a thing and I want it all out so I melt it again so that the water goes to the bottom the oil goes to the top so right here I'm just checking it the thing then it's all been melted again and as you can see right there you can see water in the bottom I'm just holding it up here you can see the water in there so yeah we were separating more water from the oil again just by melting it right here I popped it right out of the freezer I hid in the freezer you can see a tiny bit of water in the bottom there so now we're just got to get this this oil and with this frozen ass cup alright so there's the I got this little puck here of of canna oil as I call it cannabis oil and it's nicely hardened so I'm just gonna put this in here because I'm not done with it again I got something else to do you can actually just eat this stuff straight up or cook with it right now it's actually ready to go this next stuff is optional but it can be very nice to do look at that we got some disgusting ass water left over get rid of that shit so we're gonna melt this one more time it's quite the process isn't it anyways we don't want to go nuts on in here we just want it to melt to be all liquid because we've got a secret weapon now it's all melted down all nice well I don't know about all nice but it's all melted down all right we're all ready here to add the the next thing here this is optional but it makes it so that this could be water soluble it's the emulsifier called sunflower and liquid lecithin but you can also use granules or a powder I think I got this stuff though cuz I thought it would be kind of neat having a liquid that it would be real easy anyways I didn't realize how how much this stuff tastes like shit so all that bad flavor I got rid of yeah I'm just putting bad flavor back in right now look how thick this stuff is it's crazy so you don't have to do this some people say that it's better it makes it work better I don't know I find both ways are good I'm putting it in now because I have it plus it makes it better for baking and other sort of things like that and you put in about a teaspoon for every cup and I think all in all I have around a cup of oil slightly less than a cup well yeah I'm not mixing that with a spoon we're using the mixer on that and don't turn this up high with this melted on oil leave it on low and just give it a real good mixing for a while so I mix all that nasty lecithin shit in there real good now I'm just putting it back into this container here and I'm gonna put this back inside the fridge after this so it resolidify it and this time we'll have lecithin all mixed in through our tattoo so it's got that going for it as well here we go finished product there it is it's a real nice puck of awesome cannabis oil made from the leftovers from vaping all made with legal cannabis were bought from like OCS and sqd seed anyway so I thought I would weigh it too just to see what weighs in the end comes up at 170 170 grams so it was around 200 and you lose a little bit with the yeah but look at that thumbs up you lose a little bit with the with the hand stuff there the cheesecloth and you lose a little bit with the just being in the plant matter or whatever but yeah it just lost 30 so yeah that's 50 some grams in there pretty good and I later melted some hash into it as well because I thought why not although that made it softer from now on so if you're ever gonna do that I would say maybe you know do it before adding the emulsifier well that's it for the how to make cannabis oil tutorial on video that I made that's how I do it and they always changed it up a little bit here in there just to try out new and different things and different techniques and whatnot but it usually turns out to be pretty good stuff and I've never been had a bad batch yet so that's how you do it anyways if you want to subscribe click the subscribe button there and if you hit the bell it'll tell you when a new video comes up I usually do review videos of legal cannabis actually that's all I do so yeah this was a different video I just thought I'd make this for those people who want to know how to do it but we'll see you later have a good one",

Fahrenheit step 2 beat the cake mix water can of oil and eggs in a large bowl on low speed for 30 seconds remember that if you don't have any can of oil and instead are using regular oil you can add your ground cannabis now then on medium speed for 2 minutes until it gets all the lumps out step 3 add one cup of chocolate or vanilla chips and beat or hand whisk until creamy I've just poured in my white chocolate chips and I hand mix them in instead of putting them through the mixer you put them in through the mixer you're going to chop up your candy and it's going to take away the texture that

coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably

and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is

regular pancakes made with a little bit of cannabis butter I'm gonna show you a really simple way to make cannabis butter right at home to do this you're just gonna need a few things a pot of boiling water a couple of mason jars and some butter some cheesecloth and some cannabis the first step is just weigh out about two grams of cannabis what I'm gonna do is combine cannabis and butter in one of the mason jars and I'm gonna place it into a pot of boiling water for about two hours so it'll D carb and infuse and now I'm just so my next step is gonna be to strain this out so that I remove all of the cannabis flowers and any little particles and I'm just left with my pure infused butter and then I'm just gonna ball up my cheese cloth around the cannabis I'm just gonna squeeze it out and get any remaining butter out of the cannabis you can use this cannabis butter to make a variety of dishes but I'm gonna use it to make some pancakes I'm gonna need one and a half cups of flour three and a half teaspoons of baking soda and I'll need one tablespoon of sugar so I'm gonna add all my dry ingredients to my mixing bowl here I'm gonna add three tablespoons of my cannabis butter an egg and of course a cup of milk I'm just gonna mix this until it's got a nice smooth consistency and to butter the pan I'm gonna use some of our cannabis butter and I'm gonna pour on my first pancake just gonna measure one out I don't want huge pancakes kind of looking for medium sized ones and my last pancake is just about done perfect mmm he's getting out really good [Music]", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "bW5trBzVAzE": "a councilman from Dearborn Michigan is outraged over a 911 he wants to know why no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to

time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the

yes you can overdose you definitely can overdose I don't know who said you can't overdose on weed but you can so say all right you guys I know you're looking at this how to light nobody overdose on me weed is natural you can't overdose but you can you can smoke a little bit too much or you can't eat a little bit of too much of brownies and your body can't really handle it so I call that overdosing yes let's get right into the story so me personally I'm not a big a weak smoker I don't really you know partake in the weed Soho whenever I do partake it's like one puff I'm done I'm super high I'm annoyed I'm regretting even smoking it so yes I'm a super lightweight when it comes to you know so as you can see I'm already a lightweight so anything more than a puff is gonna be way too much for me so keep that in mind so my boyfriend at the time made some weed brownies and he said it was mixed with purp and cush whatever that is - cush so it's like two strong weeds that he made into the brownie so yeah so I don't call him myself I'm gonna try the brownie I've always wanted to try some weed brownies and he made it so I'm going to try it so yes I'm eating the weed brownie and I'm like hmm I'm not feeling nothing so I take another bite wait a little bit I'm not feeling nothing I end up eating the whole brownie not feeling anything ten twenty minutes go by I'm like this is not working for me what did you do with it I'm well I'm already a lightweight so I'm like okay maybe I need to eat a little bit more so I took another weed brownie start eating on bed felt nothing so I said whole-wheat brownie so now I've eaten - we brownies they're about this size the wheat brownie was probably about the size of this nerd container you know not too thick but maybe around that size and I ate two of those okay so I'm like okay whatever you didn't you didn't make those wheat brownies right so we did laughing and talking himself so maybe like 20 minutes after I ate the last bleep brownie we were on our way to the mall so we were going to Linux mall because I wanted to pick up some outfits because we were going to a concert later on in that week so I was going to pick up a couple of dresses Tryon and stuff like that so yeah on the way to the mall I'm starting to feel a little bit funny I'm like and I'm selling my boyfriend like I think I'm getting high he's like doing some we're on it so I'm like okay hopefully I'm not gonna get too high because I ate two weed brownies I'm not too worried about it by then because I'm just feeling good you know I'm starting to get a little high so I'm starting to get a little bit giggly and you know happy and we were just out in the city we're going to the mall I'm gonna buy some dresses I'm just in a happy mood so by the time we get into the mall you know I'm still getting hella high I'm getting higher and higher and higher by the minute but you know I could tolerate it and it felt good you know it was that good hi so you know I'm in the mall and we were at deep forgot the name of the store but it's a store that's not there anymore it's like an urban store so we went in this urban store and I was china-us and directed he was picking up some dresses for me and I was trying it on I was in the dressing room trying on some dresses and I'm like yo this is getting a little bit too intense for me like I need to do a bout of hair because something is not right I'm not feeling it I'm not feeling good I'm about to freak out in my head and I'm like just get me out of this story like just get me home so I'm coming out I'm like please just pick up some dresses pay for it I tried on at home and you know whatever if I don't like it I'll bring it back so he's like paying for the directors we're at the register the store is completely packed you guys like a Saturday the mall is completely packed so yeah so I'm at the register standing next to my boyfriend and he's paying for the stuff and I'm like getting super high and it's getting like super super intense like I'm getting super high super quick so I'm just standing there like yo just put this back let's just leave right now because I'm not feeling good I'm bout to pass the spell like I'm about to pass out he's like just chill out chill out man you'll be okay when you finished and with something we could lead I'm like no I'm about to pass out he's like so I'm just standing there holding on to him because I'm just like freaking out by now my face is getting really really really really hot and I'm just like yo what the hell is going on I've never felt this way this is just freaking me the hell out right so I'm holding on to no I'm like yo get me out of the store like we got to leave right now he's almost done paying for the stuff and the woman at the counter just looking at me everybody's starting to look at me by now and I'm just telling him let's get the hell out of this store because my bucks cats up so I'm like yo let's go and then by the time I finish my senses I'm just blacking out and I'm just sliding down when I'm like this I just completely blacked out my body completely gave out and I just asked the hell out in the middle of the store in the middle of everything and I just passed out on my boyfriend luckily he caught me so he's holding me up like this and I'm just repeatedly passing out over and over and over you guys this was the most maybe like the most embarrassing moment of my life like in the middle of a packed store passing out over and over so he's dragging me out of the store because by then I I can't even I can't even hold myself up like my body just keeps passing out I keep blacking out blacking out blacking out so he drags me out of the store and take me into the mall and there's like a [ __ ] stuff like right next to the store so he set me on the bench and I'm just sitting there like I can't even stay up like my body just keeps going like this because I'm passing out over and over and I'm like just get me some water get me some water then we can try to make it down those escalators and we can make it to the car outside your founders by now I'm just like get me the hell out of here because something is not right oh you blind man just chill out sit right here I'm gonna go get you some water he already have finished paying for the stuff so he brought this stuff is better next to me when it got me some water I don't even want him to leave me but I wonder him to get me some water to see if that's gonna make me you know calm down and feel a little better so he left me to go get some water which felt like hours I was sitting on that [ __ ] like hours felt like and I'm just like not enough not enough because it ain't happening my body is not taking it is just shutting down so I'm just sitting there looking crazy people are looking at me so it comes back with the water I drink some of the water I'm trying to get up the energy so we can get up and go down those escalators so we can get up out of there so he stands me up and we're trying to get down escalators but I'm still nodding off he's still like dragging me holding me down the escalators so he set me down in the food court and I'm just sitting at the table he was gonna go get the car and bring it up to the front so you know I won't have far to walk so I'm sitting there in the food court at the table like sitting there on the table like this trying to just lay down but I'm laying down like this and I'm going and people are just looking at me like what the hell is wrong with this girl like I'm just looking around everybody's looking at me so that made me freak out even more so I'm just sitting there trying to keep my composure but I'm just steady not enough about to fall off the table fall off the chair it wasn't funny then but now looking back on it and every time I tell this story is like super funny to me because I shouldn't be eating all those weed brownies in the first place so he comes back in he grabs me takes me to the car I'm sitting in the car by that time you know my mind is a little bit more at ease because I'm not in a crowded mall you know everything from there on was kind of a bland remember nothing else that happened that day because we went straight home and I went straight to bed so I don't remember nothing else that happened after the mall I just know I went to bed and I slept it off so the very next day I woke up and I was still hi you guys and I was still super high but it was at the point where I can handle it like I can handle it that was the high that I wanted to achieve so that was behind that I wanted to get the next day that I woke up so yes I was high that whole day the next day so you know I was eating a lot I was giggling calming people telling them what happened and all this stuff so you guys that was like the worst time ever by the second day I was feeling a little bit more myself so I told him to get rid of those weed burner because I was never gonna touch him again I'm never gonna take anything edible because that that really sneaks up on you it doesn't happen right then but it might happen one two to three hours down the line and you can't even take it no more because you don't overdose eat you know it's a weed brownie and the sad thing about it that's not my first time overdosing on some weed yeah I have another intense story the very first time I overdose on weed and that was just you know smoking weed this time I was eating this only brownie so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video I know it's all over the place because you know this was just a spare in a moment I just wanted to tell my story and yeah so apparently you can't overdose um some wheat so let me know you guys this story have you ever overdose on some weed brownies let me

milligrams there are ten dollars apiece and they knock you on your ass man i'm going to take us out of the package put it in on a different one and put it on my lunch and go to work so i'll be eat unless it work cheers", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "BWS2bRfllQc": "hi you guys I'm here to

we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical

so you can see this like some kind of alright it's kind of like a licorice surrounded by some kind of candied crap if you will this looks like some kind of DNA like you know at size class this is what your mob real looks like ok I got a mustache [Music] alright this actually looks pretty good I I [ __ ] with this for sure yeah alright let's before I let me get a drink of my coffee really quick Wow I actually found somewhere in McDonald's in Los Angeles that the large coffee was and was under $2 it's amazing oh and my sausage McMuffin was Oh get this Los Angeles and it was at Mike Hoff my large coffee and a sausage McMuffin was barely three dollars it's great so let's get started with the review I could do without all the nerds I used to eat nerds in the candy well okay they're like the little candy crap um it's pretty good yeah really sweet I'm not like too big on these sweets do I have any nerds in my teeth I do or was that last night's food I should have rushed my teeth like that drunk anyways I give it a 7 it's pretty good candy arm I would you know if I were uh if I were a kid behind a van and I would try to lure kids into it I would definitely stock up on these for sure so very good hopefully no appeals are watching so anyways thank you for uh thank you for the money to buy that stuff for the review whatever your name is I forgot anyways uh a couple points like to make really quickly as you guys know I do reviews and then I kind of go about my daily business of life I wanted to Ross to go get a new car mouth because I broke mine because I sat on it and when I get it when I went into he says hi good morning welcome to Ross and that just ignored him and he said it again hi good morning welcome to Ross like to be hurt like look dude people all across the country we're tired of this fake corporate schmuck greeting every day every time we go into hey welcome to Dollar Tree hey welcome to this hey welcome to that weren't we don't really care to be acknowledged because it's not a genuine hello good morning it's a forced greeting from you guys that your higher-ups tell you to say and also a lot of places do that because when people come in there to steal they're less likely to steal if they know that they're acknowledged when they come in like they know that they're being watched or whatever so it's a fake ass greeting nobody cares so I ignore everybody that says oh hello welcome I don't even respond to them anymore they're so they're so fake a phony [ __ ] them anyways so I'm at this McDonald's right and the one thing about La well there's a million things that I don't like about it but one of the things about La I don't like is that the bathroom situation I hear sucks especially you know when you're in your van you don't have a home and you know you always kind of like have that one bathroom spot where it's like clean and you just stick to that one spot but like when you're when you're out about in LA it's not very convenient to just stop anywhere and go use the bathroom it really really sucks like right now I'm going to a cemetery down the way right here just to go use the bathroom I'm gonna go do a video there anyways but I'm not even gonna go use the bathroom till I get to that cemetery why cuz I know that cemetery has a bathroom and nobody ever goes there as a matter of fact the bathroom is located in the same place where what a great day Hollywood actors interred in the mausoleum so I'm gonna go visit him and go take a dump so I'm in the McDonald's and there's a guy on the can I don't know how long he's been enough so I'm like whatever so I just go order my coffee and then these slobs just start coming in there just start sliding into McDonald's and then there's like a line of like five nerds and a McDonald's and one of the Nerds this homeless bummy black guy you know the kinda like when you just walk down the street and you see him you kind of want to maybe go across the street just go away from him he starts yelling everyone like oh I've been waiting here and the other guy was like I've been waiting for 15 minutes uh here's a little bit of advice if you've been at McDonald's for 15 minutes waiting to use the bathroom how about you just go walk your happy ass over to smart and final or we got Ross over here we got Dollar Tree as bathrooms we got this 'piease apparatus clothing store which is going out of business with structs oh I love them as a matter of fact I probably to come back here and get some clothes why should I use your bathroom Jersey Mike's uh huh else you got you got a couple bathrooms over there Pizza Hut they probably got a bathroom go use the bathroom somewhere else after 15 minutes um why would you want to use the bathroom right after somebody that's been on the camp for 15 minutes and you don't even know how long they were there before you were waiting for two minutes I'm the same anyways guys this is black Megan with another review I'm kind of

morning starts at 5:30 a.m. is way", "-43lcicPRYA": "and how's it going everybody welcome back to the smoke session a.k.a how to make medicated brownies and cookies now what I enjoy doing instead of just actually making edibles as I enjoy a shatter infused edible it hits a little bit harder it's a little bit stronger so what I do is I actually use shatters for all of my edibles so if you have any of my edibles or have had any of the dandy edibles they're all shatter infused edibles so this is basically how I make them what I like to do is take some sort of shatter basically any shatter will actually work and then per the ingredients a half a cup of oil you can get it all out of there I love these little spatulas make sure that your oven is set to 350 what you're going to do this actually at all the oil that you have to carboxylate I do have a video on how to decarboxylate your oil you can set that figure out and some of my previous videos you take your decarboxylated oil put it right into your you carboxylated and shatter oil whatever it is put right straight into your me it's such a pain getting it off the paper though from here so basically you're wanting to set up your flame to go on you're gonna set your flame to it what about low medium low there's much of the oil out of there it's possible and into this well now what you're gonna end up with is this what you're gonna do is I actually let the heat take its turn tickets course you can't let all that glob melt into your oil completely you want it to completely disintegrate and completely melt until well until you can't even see it it just turns your oil black that really doesn't take long for this all to actually mix together so as its doing that you want to get your whichever cake mix brownie mix so if you never get the cake mixes you'll notice on the back of the cake mixes it says to use 3 eggs 1/2 a cup of oil and some water like a quarter cup of water we're going to take the water out and not use water at all and we're going to remove one a so we're going to use two eggs and half a cup of oil it's all we're gonna actually be using for the in all our ingredients for the cake mixes and these just make into really good cookies this way let's start now all together and what we're going to do to eggs as this oil gets finished we're going to drop the oil in so that's one package of cake mix two eggs and a half a cup of oil to make the most amazing cookies you have ever had in your life now that that's fully melted in we're gonna go ahead and drop that in there there shouldn't be any remnants of the shatter that you put into that oil that hole should be completely darkened by the shatter that you put in this helps your mixing process so that every one of your bites has is same even amount of mix and of course how much you use will be up to you I personally for my entire mix I make ten milligram bites and I make them rather small and make them about a half a teaspoon or small so my my bites really are not her biggest bites to begin with everything makes up so I'm actually using four grams of shatter for my mix here you guys are welcome to use that much or less depending on how much you want to use that would be up to you if you guys are using butter for this recipe substitute the oil for butter basically so instead of half a cup of oil you're going to use half a cup of butter and that would be your medicated cannabis butter you're gonna skip the whole shatter process you don't have to melt anything you just put your nice soft butter in instead of your oil and then do the mixing from there you know that everything is coming to a nice even mix here ooh I almost want to eat this right out like always remember and food preparation and handling it's important to wash our hands multiple times while handle include cross contamination can be a [ __ ] everybody's probably seen at home going I'm not gonna cross contaminate my own well you never know you could so what we're gonna do is now start on our bites like I said I make mine about a half a teaspoon I get about 35 per tray to this is why it's important to wash your hands because he will be handling some of your food this process actually is probably the one process it takes the longest it's just kind of piecing everything out and then after you have basically during this time is a great time for your oven to breathe preheating 350 is the oven temperature you're gonna want your oven to be at especially for cookies these things do not take long whatsoever depending on the size of the cookie this brownie makes I'll actually be doing four seven minutes most cookie mixes with the size that I make him I've been doing them for about six to seven minutes each I mean I'm not making them huge so it's not taking them long to cook getting baked with my baked goods now I will be pausing the video for the six minutes that it takes six to seven minutes that's going to take four these things actually cook out I'm not gonna bore you guys with random chatter for six to seven minutes I promise I'm just gonna pause it after I'm done here loading this up I mean I've already bored you guys enough like okay let's get to the good stuff we just want to know how to make it medicate it how does it come out how does it taste right almost almost done show you guys a good even spacing for the size of cookie that I make it's going to be a rather long video there you go just a nice even spacing make sure they sit nice and round pop them into our 350 degree oven I'm actually trying to be quiet because my son is sleeping right now so [Music] I'll be right back with some brownies and like i said i'm mackie brownies all those are something [Music] gotta let those cool off for a little bit now as soon as they're cool I can pull them off the pan but the animals are coming out great so far I've made some strawberry cookies I've also made some chocolate chip cookies and now I'm onto the brownies right now so and I'm feeling them all but uh that's pretty much it I mean there's not much else to making brownies and making cookies I mean just keep going through the dough over and over until there's no dough to go so uh you'll have a peaceful positive and productive day yours coming at you", "eUhGww8WyIo": "-Congratulations.\nYou are a married man. -Yeah, that\u00b4s true.\n-Hey, that\u00b4s

Which was very sweet.\nShe put a lot of effort into it, but the guest list got\na little out of control where, like, you know,\nmy manager\u00b4s assistant sister\u00b4s best friend was there. And, like, if you know me,\nI\u00b4m a pretty private person, and I don\u00b4t like to be\nthe center of attention. And so I freaked out.

[ Laughter ] -How do you dress like cocaine? -All white, wrapped in\nSaran Wrap or something. So I\u00b4m downstairs\nliterally throwing up and throwing a tantrum,\nwhile cocaine is upstairs raiding our fridge. So, Alison had --\nAlison and I, we -- We still talked about how\nwe survived my surprise party. We can surprise -- Or,\nwe can survive anything, yeah. -And we\u00b4re all worried,\nis cocaine all right? -Cocaine seems to be okay, yeah.\n-All right.

like that nondescript black bag sitting on the floor and in my stone mind I'm like who leaves their [ __ ] right there like you don't forget your bag what you're getting ready to put it on the Kara so to go through the x-ray I was like I bet there's a [ __ ] bomb in that bag [Music] all right what's up everyone and just Greg and Matt here from Project I'm broken and today we're gonna learn a little bit about edibles you know I have a lot of experience with smoking weed smoking marijuana I actually smoked with Matt probably 10 times a day for many years funny thing is I've never really gotten into edibles and Matt has a lot of experience with it so I kinda want to question him today just I want to know some different things about eating out of us stay tuned I want you to tell me is what's the main difference between smoking weed and eating and edible I think the main difference is understanding the dosage or how much you're ingesting after you I mean I I feel like when we used to smoke I would smoke more often I really I kind of knew if I take two hits off a blunt or smoke a blunt or a joint or hit a bowl or a bong I kind of knew what that was gonna do to me similar to having a shot or having a beer with edibles it's kind of you know especially when I first started messing with edibles I was making them myself and I you know I was making the butter and then making the the you know the brownie or whatever the vehicle was I had no idea how strong it was so it was like Russian roulette with what I was getting that's probably the biggest difference is understanding how high I was gonna get now can you tell me the difference between how you feel with smoking versus eating them yeah smoking again and it's it's more of an immediate reaction like again you take a hit you feel the immediate kind of consequence of that hit so you get a little bit high you smoke more you get higher with the edible it's a little bit different it's almost like eating mushrooms or any other sort of psychedelic because all the sudden things start to change and you don't at first you're like is that real or later is that like me or is that the drug and it's a little bit difficult to figure it out of her so really for me I'll say that the edibles it's almost like a more clear kind of feeling because when you when you smoke I don't know I just feel like real hazy immediately with the edible you're thinking clearly and all of a sudden it just starts to shift and you're not really sure what's going on so can you tell me how long does an edible take to kick in it's different every single time it depends on you know again what's already in your stomach if you've eaten recently you know if yet if you're on an empty stomach what you're eating whether it's like a little gummy or like a brownie I feel like they all have a potential to hit you quickly or it could take up to I've had it take up to two hours before anything's kicked in so can you tell me what happens when you eat too much do you have any crazy stories oh my god yeah I've got a couple of them one time because I used to obviously eat edibles before I would get on flights and I was traveling you know a pretty good amount and this one time I had these cookies and I ate them right before I got to the airport like what I was parking my car I ate them and started working my way to the terminal and usually you can reliably you know like Greg just asked how longs it take the itch it usually I could rely on it taking like 30 minutes to an hour somewhere around there before anything heavy so when I'd be traveling I'd be fine if I ate them usually like maybe right around when the plane took off I would start feeling it and whatever but this time it hit me like real quick I ate these things and then bear ate these cookies and like 20 minutes later I'm just getting ready to go put my go through the security line to put my luggage on whatever go through the metal detectors and all that stuff and it hits me real hard like a truck and I'm not freaking out because I have a pretty good amount of experience with this but I was like ah like I wish this didn't hit me so quick yeah so gotta deal with people and you know TSA agents and all that [ __ ] so I'm standing in line and you know we're getting ready to put our our luggage on the through the x-ray machine bang and in the line next to me a TSA agent runs up and he's like does anybody know whose bag this is and they're just like that nondescript black bag sitting on the floor and in my stone mine I'm like who leaves their [ __ ] right there like you don't forget your bag what you're getting ready to put it on the carousel to go through the x-ray I was like I bet there's a [ __ ] bomb in that bag and the guy in front of me was like damn you don't want to hear that like that's not a good thing the year right before you get on a plane so I'm [ __ ] bugging out trying to get through this line and I get on the other side of it and my main objective is to get my bag and just like get away from the situation as quickly as possible they're moving us through and I go through the metal detector all as well and I'm looking for my bag and I see like everybody else's bag is coming through and I'm standing there for like 20 [ __ ] minutes and finally I realized that my bag was like sitting I walked to the wrong carousel to pick up my [ __ ] and pry just look like a stone [ __ ] at that point but it just goes to show you it likes a simple task like putting your bag through the x-ray machine and going to pick it up in the same line was not possible for me it took me 20 minutes to realize that something that's crazy did you have any anxiety when you got on the plane no that was actually the least anxiety I would experience ever when you know I was eating edibles and again I ate them a lot when I was travelling the more I would have more anxiety waiting to get on the plane get into my seat put my bag where it needs to be like once I got in my seat I was like like it was just I felt very calm and relaxed I was like in my little zone I was good to go interesting so would you see that when you say there's any dangers to eating edibles yeah yeah I mean especially if you're inexperienced with them I mean there's countless stories of people calling the cops on themselves and freaking out or thinking they're dead I've always been okay with that and especially with edibles I don't know I mean I've had some really powerful ones where I'm even like seeing you know patterns changing on the floor and [ __ ] like that but I've always been pretty good at kind of understanding that this drug was not gonna be like it was it wasn't gonna be in me forever so even when things got really intense it was hard for me to comprehend social interactions or situations I knew I was like I you just got to get through this now I've done I've done psychedelics a fair amount of times with mushrooms and what you just explained seems somewhat similar are they similar to mushrooms in a way I guess I guess it depends on dosage I would definitely put mushrooms at another category but there can be some real similarities in to the intensity of how high you are you know as you know with mushrooms like you're just it is it's hard to I remember once I was trying to like make a sandwich and I couldn't do it like really simple things like you just can't figure out there is that similarity with with edibles sometimes like you're you're trying to do something you're like why is this not working and it's it's real bizarre because you're you're trying to critically think about something very simple to do and it's just I don't know for whatever reason your brain doesn't want to react in a in the freight way very interesting so I learned a lot about animals got any final words on it proceed with caution if you're messing with edibles I get it is nice you know in a lot of states now where marijuana is recreationally or medically legal you kind of know what you're getting a little bit more again if you're if you like your friend made brownies or you made brownies start small you can always eat more later but again it's very difficult because it's very typical for somebody to eat the edible and then an hour or even maybe two hours go by and they're like I'm not feeling it I'm gonna eat some more and then everything hits you at once and it's just way too much and again you can't dose it like you do smoking once you adjust it it's a it's it's in you and you got to wait it out so just be careful with with how much he start small go from there all right thank you man yeah thank you alright so hope y'all enjoyed that interview style thing on edibles there was funny as Matt's that people have called the cops on themselves and actually reminded me of this story - cops allegedly ate some marijuana edibles got way too high and called for backup being a common calling the cops on yourself yeah and they don't up getting suspended that's pretty funny so yeah thank you for that video I actually learned a lot I've never really done edible as if I do I don't remember I remember how they feel so I actually learned something from that hopefully y'all did too comment like subscribe we'll see y'all the next video", "OqTuUd9-ytg": "making accurate cannabis products was impossible we came and we made that a reality [Music] ardan is a biotech company that's focused on giving people tools so that they can use medical cannabis better and more efficiently there's a reason that people have to smoke cannabis or have to make cannabis brownies those compounds that you're looking for the THC the CBD they're not active and you won't feel any effects so no you can't just eat weed you actually have to put it through a chemical process of decarboxylation and that process is a heating process think of it as activation this is about to activation you're not gonna have any effect some of the rays that people are dee carving now making a butter or oil or using the oven or using the toaster oven or even the crock-pot the precision in heating and the even heating is really lacking we've all heard the stories or experience the situation where we have a very well-intentioned friend who's made some cannabis brownies and everybody at the party has the terrible reaction and ends up having to be in bed for a couple of days people are just going by oh my treats or my medicine turns out and I get an effect from it they aren't really surprised to find out how much they're wasting by either over decarboxylated or burning or by under decarboxylated unfortunately an oven fluctuates in temperature 10 to 20 degrees in either direction when I say that the carb is really a precision process even the difference of one or two degrees will impact the process so there really is a science behind use of cannabis that was really the for me that said wait a minute in order to achieve this it's gonna require something that doesn't exist right now and I'm gonna make it first it needed perfectly even heating so these are the silicon heater that wraps around the entire chamber we use two precision sensors one that's actually on the heating element and one that's buried deep inside the cavity of the device to control and create these perfect zones of heating to fully permeate and activate all of that material in there you can take the material and you put it inside the inner container you just press the button and the light will turn red and after about an hour and a half to two hours a light will turn green and as simple as that because the material is active you can actually just take a teeny bit and just sprinkle it right into your food there's no need to extract it or do anything else with it at this point and because you're actually getting such precision D card you only have to use a tiny bit so imagine it's like sprinkling pepper or salt on to a meal you're really not even going to taste it you don't need to be a scientist or have this extensive background with cannabis to be able to use it well [Music]", "dbDW36s_8_o": "[Music] you know I don't want it's so good but this child snare it's so good I wanted to have something bad you know they know that's where I don't mind you mr. Nass here's your report on your grade I want to talk to you after class please I don't I don't I'm concerned about face mr. Nast um we have a problem here you've been failing forward with classes I need to talk to you and your parents about this issue and what are those brownie contain sir I've been eating it you've been

this away from you give me up sir now give me um please smash I don't want you turn my class I'm gonna take this to the principal and see what kind of stuff you have in this I don't think it's just a regular brownie [Music]", "vQVXrOLrW9c": "[Music] [Applause] hey guys my name is Chiana and today I'm gonna be showing you a really easy way to make peanut butter now I chose peanut butter as my first video because once you know how to make it the possibilities are good today I'm gonna be using it to make a batch of brownies but really you can use it for any recipe that calls for butter I like to put it on my toast in the morning you can really get creative with it so that's why I just want to show you this easy recipe I do want to say that I usually use the magical butter machine to make my butter it's just an infusion machine and I know that a lot of people don't have it and they don't want to spend that $200 to make it and this comes out just the same anyway so I really just picked a recipe that you guys can make with the stuff that you already have in your house pretty much you get started I do want to say the link to the recipe is gonna be in the description below which will take you to my website and you can see the recipe and everything else you need so what you're gonna need is a strainer and some cheesecloth you're gonna need about a cup of water you need some butter and you're gonna need your flour can't forget that today I'm using and eat them an ounce of flour and I'm using a specific butter now I'm just using this cuz I'm going to put all my butter into one batch of Rowney you can also use half an ounce of flour and a pound of butter which is four sticks you can also change your flour amount depending on if you want it more potent if you want a less opponent it's really up to you what you want to do you're in charge of your destiny so let's start with the first jack decarboxylation so decarboxylation sounds really confusing but it's really simple actually it happens naturally when you smoke the combustion when you heat your herb it activates the THC same with vaporizing it so when you have your flour when it's harvested it actually not has containing the THC it's containing two hc' egg so once you put it in the oven we're converted and THC I into the THC which is the psychoactive component as most of you probably know so really decarboxylation is just activating it by heat and if any of the most out of your so I already have it in this little plastic baggie and I already broke it up mostly but you can really just do it with your hand and don't be too nit picky about it it's it's really not that hard just break it up it's a little small pieces the reason we're doing this is because when you heat it you want it to spread evenly so that it heats evenly and also later on when you're making your butter the more surface area that your flour has the easier it's gonna be for it to absorb into the fat of the butter so I tell you what to have that and also you don't want to make it too small so it goes through the cheesecloth don't be too hard on yourself you'll do great now I'm just gonna spread it onto my baking sheet now I also use a covered baking dish in the past you can really use whatever you want I do want to say that it will make your house smell like flour so if you have roommates or parents or anyone I just want to give you that little disclaimer so I don't have a lot of flour today so it's not that hard for me to spread it but that it's spreading evenly d calculation is very simple you won't mess up I promise so actually I've even my ovens at 240 degrees and I'm gonna keep it in there for 45 minutes now that's in the oven we'll see you in 45 minutes okay guys now let it's been 45 minutes we're ready for our next step so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our butter and we're gonna put it on medium low heat and I like it more on the lower end because throughout this entire process you never want your butter to come to a boil so we're just gonna leave it there once it butter is melted you're ready to add your water and the water is really just to prevent the butter from squirting or burning the bottom of the pan and it also ensures that throughout this process when it evaporates your butter and your flowers on evaporating but the water is instead so I'm ready to add my water and I'm just gonna let this melt for a little bit okay it's now that it's melted we're ready to add our herb so aren't going to do is you're just going to put your decarboxylated flower into it and I'm just going to give it a little bit stir now we're just gonna let this sit here for three hours and I'm gonna come back every 30 or 45 minutes and check on it make sure it's looking good and just give it a little bit of a stir because you obviously always want to stay by it when you have something on stove so I'll see you in three hours okay guys so I have a little bit of a confession to make I actually ended up abandoning my butter last night but as Confucius once said it does not matter how slowly we go as long as we do not stop so we're just gonna tread on and grab my butter off the stove that may or may not have been simmering for three hours and we're pretty much ready for one of the last steps so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my strainer and I'm gonna take my cheesecloth I'm gonna put the cheesecloth over this trainer and I have my glass bowl this is the boiler butter is going to go in so glass is always better just because plastic when it gets hot could leak some toxic stuff into it but what I'm gonna do is gonna take my butter and I'm just going to pour it through the cheesecloth just gonna strain it through and it's going a little bit slow but that's okay just push it down make sure I'm doing as much as I can out and it'll speed up the process a little bit do you like my spatula kiss the cook I'm still going so if you have more butter you might be here for a little bit more time and if it's not too hot you can't even take your cheesecloth and push down on it with your hands just get the remaining golden juice out okay I think I got it all and so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna cover it I'm gonna put it in the fridge until it hardens which might be a few hours okay so now that my butter is hardened finally it felt like it took forever you can see here that the water has kind of sunk to the bottom and separated itself out from the butter and so the last step really is gonna be to get this water out of here and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a knife and I'm really carefully just going to cut along the sides of the butter and I'm gonna do it without breaking it hopefully because all I'm trying to do is make a big enough of a hole where I can get the water to come out and the harder your butter is gonna be the better it's gonna be for it not to break so that's about it and now I can really just pop the rest of the butter out if I want but what I'm left with here is just a beautiful circle of peanut butter and so that's pretty much it I hope you guys like my video feel free to leave a comment and make any requests for nights and videos and recipes that you guys want to see okay well I'll see you next time [Music]", "O-vRIWC0UjU": "hey my babies how y'all doing sugar just sitting here looking at how beautiful life

brownies", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "Yv3dOwz1Aqc": "okay come on yeah my brain is smarter though this is the weirdest experience", "3icfRUQ_Fu0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

when it comes out we're gonna add some what are gonna happen to it oh I really like all this keep to that pineapple one of the best hands down okay so we have the black peppercorns that we just kind of ground-up mortar and pestle shrimp powder so this is for like umami that Korean add chili pepper powders for the little bit of spice right how much keep do you think we're doing you I think it's gonna be activated really that much I would just do you know like a good pinch like you would a normal spices all right we're gonna add a little bit of this pineapple Keith Keith has an interesting history right it's one of the oldest extraction methods just agitation and screens people recently have really been kind of elevating it to a new level before it used to have a lot of plant matter and it was kind of a less clean product but now people are getting it to the point where it's like 99% of just the gland heads which is like what you want in a concentrate this is the coconut sugar with the THC and I think we should toss the chicken in that to just be fun so you get this nice like almost our Encana hue from here we put equal parts salt the wings right when it comes out of the oil instead of hitting with just regular salt we're gonna hit it with this thanks the first time they've ever been fried chicken wings tossed and Keith is it good we could have more of that beef flavor

brownies we're gonna be using a little something called a TVB so this is already saved but says can be in the form of normal weed or you've got your CBD which is this guy here and we've got you can be here so we're gonna add this at the end of the recipe to get the best effects so first of all you give a grind up your CBD and then you're gonna use it in a herbal vaporizer such as tax-free fine things are the best because you can fit a lot of CBD in there and once that's all thanked essentially just empty your bowl until you get a good amount like that and then so when a lot of people use their CBD in their urban vaporizers they tend to throw away what's left but you can still use this so good think about it you can actually eat it as it is so after you faint it you can eat this if you want it's not going to taste the best so we get an experiment and mix in some brownies so you will need 185 grams of unsalted butter 185 grams of dark chocolate or milk chocolate or any fancy dark chocolate it tastes better yes better of the two 85 grams of plain flour 40 grams of cocoa powder three large eggs and 275 grams of caster sugar and as much anything bitter times will allow you to take so first off we're going to mount our and chocolate and go from there so 185 grams of chocolate and 185 grams of butter yep okay so we're going to put the chocolate in the microwave have for about a minute but keep thinking out about every 10 seconds just to check how it's doing it might take a bit longer than that depending on the microwave just keep on a low setting yeah don't want to burn the truck there okay so once you've melted the chocolate we are weighing out the butter and hundred eggs five grams of butter as well and that goes into another Bowl to know so now we've got the melted butter and then onto chocolate we're going to preheat the oven to 180 degrees 160 from a fan oven so now we're going to mix the chocolate and melted butter together and then ena for a number of a mini or two and then leave that to cool until it's at room temperature one of the things we might receive anything oh we could do cupcakes cookies waffles pancakes you could even make your own chocolate bar essentially anything that involves butter so you can do full course meal and do some lamb shanks some mashed potato well see very much potato nice so now we're gonna line the bowl so it's just so the browning doesn't stick to the bottom anyway so now you're square or rectangle a little bit this we can use to actually butter up there [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to do the dry ingredients so you got your flour and cocoa powder your so and you're sure that I often beaten the roads how long does that take specifically to work well it depends on the potency so it all comes down to how much you're gonna put on top but usually the time is in rhythm so half an hour up to two hours so I feel after half an hour to us so it's the same as when you're fading the CBD or when you've got under the drug towns so it will know you out you've been it's relaxed nice got light so if we need 85 grams of flour so now we're just gonna stick this into the bowl get rid of any lumps that are in here so who's even going to help law benefits other so why do you seek deem a leave sort of back pain and a lot of people use it for going to sleep at night so more or less for people veterans or crank pain always having trouble to sleep at night it's gonna help with that now we do need the cocoa powder about 50 grams if you're a poor dane use this evening sorry most of the dry ingredients done now that's what you say as well okay so now we've just broken up some chocolate we're just gonna add some in there for a bit of different texture because it's delicious but obviously you can add anything you want to it's completely optional what you added at this point yeah let's just check those in there yep so next we break in free eggs I'm not as I can't break eggs yeah we need 275 grams of caster sugar that is to go in with the eggs cool yeah it'll weigh down so it's going to make 5 grams of sugar yeah all right now we're going to mix all the egg and sugar together with a whisk for about six to eight minutes yes and you want to whisk it until it's quite pale color joke just show this yes prepay or something yeah that should be good to go cool so what's next so now we're gonna mix in the melted butter and chocolate into the Moosey mixture so we're gonna fold it in to try and keep as much air in there as we can [Music] you don't want to stir it's gonna get rid of the air right joke yeah that's why you're gonna fold it in this way that's it so obviously today we're going to eat TBD but yeah there's lies on the ways you can have CVD what are all the other ways so you've got the flat form which is in that jar there yeah and then you've also got oils so you've got the under the tongue drops you've got the both liquids and you've also got might faint sprays you've got CBD drinks there's out there now possibilities of illness yeah so you always see you see really quite a lot would you say eating's one of the best ways or what would you say is probably the best way of taking CVD I would say that the fake liquids are the best ways to take care cure Lee because as soon as you found that about a minute later is into your system and it's already working you know instead of in Internet yeah and then seconds probably the CBD flour so it's sound principle it gets into your system a lot quicker and then third I would go under the tongue drops and take about half an hour to kick in and with the edibles such as the brownies this can take a piss or two backwards so some people might want a baby or smoke or put it under their tongue Satan's probably a better solution because most people at brownies yeah a lot of people like brownies in some people but you can make any food with singing gays so it doesn't essentially have to be practice yeah so now we're going to add in the chocolate lumps and then we're gonna sit in the rest of this mixture into they're almost done so now the tracks are in there all we have to do is sit in this mix and [Music] so we've finished folding it all in and it's looking pretty much like brownie mixture very Brown nice and gooey yes none of the flowery dustiness to left or anything at all yeah so now we're gonna pour it in and start the cooking process [Music] [Music] so some flat or even as even as we can get anyway now it's just time to cook so you want the thickness of the brownie to be pretty even or over just so you don't have some parts of really cooked in some parts that are all yeah one ends really thick in the others roof in you're gonna have a burnt side and then slightly raw sighs that's not not amazing no it's a we even it's looking good what we have to do now is pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes cuz should be done so it's 25 minutes in the oven yeah if you want to put it in the middle of the oven dry heat so we've set the timer for 25 minutes obviously it's not 25 on there now so we've said it a few seconds ago but once that's done we're gonna double check to see if it's good say if it's wobbling when we move the Train then it has to go in for a little bit longer okay so the Bradley is all done all we have to do now is let cool down and melt the last bit of chocolate for a little layer on top and then we're just gonna sprinkle the avb on top of that is now for the finishing touches we're gonna add the ADB into the melted chocolate pour it on top even out and be done once they're cold why is it worth putting in the chocolate and neither are mixes so you can do it either way but where this has or have been heated up in the PACs device it's already gone through the process of decarboxylate so you're gonna get the effects I mean you can it straight away it just skips having to cook it in butter for about three hours okay so if you didn't want to vape it first yet to get the ABV you would just cook in butter first yeah so what you usually do is in like a slow cooker mix it with some butter leave it for about three hours 10 and staring at about every half an hour okay it's just quicker way to do it so you don't have to bake it first you can just cook in the best yeah [Applause] [Music] so similarly as we did one for the actual brownie mix in there 10 we're now just spreading evenly over the seemingly melted chocolate so we've spreaded on the melted chocolate mix with the avb so we can give it about an hour to cool and then it could to eat oh thank you very much for watching Olivia vape induced e-m-f CVD star share this on to your friends who want to make CBD brownies happy baking [Music] [Music]", "5IU-Xd-D_NI": "what's going everybody welcome to my channel so today I wanted to just go over what it's the best type of fat to use to make your edibles is it Kenan butter is it better to use coconut oil is it better to use MCT oil so there's a lot of people getting into this market and you know people are using different types of ore to infuse their marijuana remember marijuana is fat soluble so you need some type of that you use butter the oil you can use coconut oil you can use olive oil there's different type of oil to use to infuse your marijuana me personally I only use butter and coconut now when it come down to those two wishes the best bet to use that's what I'm gonna talk about today so as you can see here I have all of my products I have my weed butter coconut oil in CTE world so when you come down to what's the best approach that we use this wannabe hands down coconut oil coconut oil is the best for various reasons for one oh it's gonna be packed with heavier fats it's going to butter will lately a lot of people have been using MCT oil and what I learned from doing my research is you gotta know when to use MCT oil and when to use the coconut oil okay so when you come down to your coconut oil there's going to be four different type of MCT so you're gonna have here c6 your c8 your seed sin and your c12 so your CSIS is your component asset your CHS your compare late acid your c10 is your cap rate at and you're seeing 12 is your alert accent so basically those four MCT is gonna make up your now with your MC t on the bit different is it's not gonna have your seats row it's just your lorry caster so the lorry is the most prevalent at all of the MTT and matter of fact most people don't even consider it to be a MC so overall the biggest thing is MC t actually comes from coconut oil what it does is it's going to remove the lower exit from the product so the MC T is going to be mostly your c8 your seats in and maybe your c6 but it won't have the c2 up ending at all so most people use the MCT oil for like you can use it for salad you can use the first shade coffee smoothies so basically what the MCC does it's supposed to increase your energy and also it's supposed to help with your weight as well to help you lose weight back so once I figure that out what I'm going to start doing from now on is only using this to make like my cannabis protein shake or my CBD protein shake make my salad make my coffee those type of things now what I'm making my you know my brownies making you know my any other type of edibles rice krispies treats whatever I'm going to be using the regular coconut ball so once again just know when to use what were you making edibles that's gonna make a big difference in how great your products are watching making so keep that in mind hopefully this video was

out with barb so today we have some gluten-free brownies that we are going to make so what we have here is some cacao some chocolate chips eggs we have some raw almond butter that we'll be adding into our mix and we also have some gave and if you like you can use maple syrup as well too and if you like to add some hemp hearts you can but we are going to use this which is a brown rice chocolate protein just to add some more flavor into our brownie mix so i've got a little bit of almond butter in here already and we're going to add the rest of this into our bowl so this is going to give it some texture it's also going to help bind the product the ingredients all together so a little work here so hope you're working out to get this recipe down pat lots of stirring and lots of mixing [Music] just a little bit more so we're going to be using about 1 and 16 ounces of raw almond butter and you can also probably use another type of butter if you like but being safe and staying away from the nuts peanuts we're using almond you could probably even use sunflower butter too if you like so there you go we used all of that and i'm just going to soften it down so i can put the other ingredients in so we're going to take some of our cacao powder here and add this to the mix so this is a half a cup of cacao powder and we'll blend that in as well cacao powder actually is really good for us it has a natural magnesium in it so you don't need to have a lot of this one piece will i hope those cravings for chocolate so folding that in then we're going to add some of the other ingredients which is our agave and gabe we're going to be using quite a bit of this it calls for one cup and actually we're going to go back to this one so i can get my cup so we're going to add the chocolate chips in add those in then i can use this cup to add the cabbage so agave we're adding one and one quarter cup [Music] we're almost there so that's taking all of that i'm gonna dump that all in that off to the side because now we're done with that let me just bind this together so i'm gonna fold it getting it mixed in there really well and remember there's actually no flour in this recipe we're using the protein powder all right so we're adding two eggs so our first egg and our second egg get that all blended in there as well we've got all the ingredients ready and then come on over to the stove we're gonna put this in our baking pan it uh the temperature is 350 for about 35 to 40 minutes baking it's going to be so yummy and delicious let's move my spoon out of the way so i can get all of it down to the last drop so i'm just going to flatten it out here on our pan these are great for freezing as well too you can pull them out when you have guests over so those chunks in there are actually almond chunks because we used an almond butter that had chunks but you can use also the smooth one look at that wow beautiful and we'll bring it over to the oven and slide it in for 35 minutes to 40 minutes we'll check up on it oh that was a lot of work but i'm sure it's gonna be worth it welcome back we're waiting for our brownies to cook so in the meantime we'd like to share what

choosing ABC 15 at 6:00 I'm Steve Irvine and I'm Kim Tobin in for semi Hockridge tonight where did it come from it is the question goodyear police are asking tonight just over 24 hours since five students got sick from candy that may have contained marijuana while the police focus on that parents are asking how do you talk to your kids about this right ABC 15s Mike Pelton live in Encino schools in Goodyear and Mike how are we supposed to teach our kids what is safe when it actually looks just like candy yeah and even today goodyear police tell me it appears the candy involved in all of this was a gummy covered with sugar so today we talked with a local dispensary about how to tell the difference between edible marijuana and real candy headaches were the symptom marijuana candy possibly the cause so say good year police looking into where a student got it on Tuesday before giving it to four others a typical like Apple ring you know you name it it has all different types of forms we talked to Anthony Harrington the CEO with all greens dispensary which is not connected to the incident in Goodyear and even though it comes in a form of a candy it needs to be treated like medicine so it's on the patient to put it in a safe place based in Sun City Anthony says there's a big appetite for candy infused with THC the types of patients that we're seeing that are buying maybe a little more elderly or those who are just who can't smoke maybe it's too harsh for them when they're smoking according to state law when dealing with medical marijuana products need to come with a label and warning keep out of reach of children it appears some manufacturers put it in different places this one it's on the back on another a warning comes right up top you can see the clear a distinction of the medical marijuana plant Anthony tells me these bags of candy should never end up in the hands of kids to parents he says find a case and lock it up it's medicine you would not keep aspirin now you would not keep ibuprofen out if you have underage children who may who may who see it and may take it as candy you know it's the same type of thing now that dispensary holds weekly educational classes meanwhile back here in goodyear police they are still working to determine how and where the student got the candy we're live in Goodyear tonight Mike Pelton ABC 15 Arizona developing tonight the investigate", "gTVR4LjVVI4": "hello YouTube about you doing I know it's been a minute sorry sorry sorry I was trying of trying to figure out how to get everything going I'm

you when you go off of a recipe off of a box you just want to make sure that you you just want to replace the fat content from the ingredients okay so this has the eggs the water and the vegetable oil so I have just enough texture so like we're gonna do um let's do our hey Flo are you doing my brain was going on girlfriend um what do i brown it tonight Oh lose my [ __ ] voice that's it it's over

have Chris because I don't nothin and it's a stupid job but it's not my house the [ __ ] is going on in here I mean I have him put the oven on for 375 I think it says on the bed on box we're gonna be using a 8x8 pan which is gonna bake take about like 30 minutes to cook maybe a little bit less I think it was like 27 to 31 so I was you know I like could cook whatever you do baked goods you hey Rachel are you doing girl I haven't seen you for a minute I feel like um so when you're doing like baked goods you want to try and leave them just a little bit undercooked when because when they come out of the oven they are so hot and they still cook and cannabis like if you cook it to where it's like a hard cookie or you know I'm saying like hotter that it is it doesn't last well and these treats like cannabis treats you need to be able to you know like you're gonna have brownies you're not gonna eat you know those brownies if there's ten of them you guys gonna be ten days before you get to that last one so you want to keep them a little bit nice and moist and that goes with any type of baked goods I try and do own two cakes I'm not very big fine ah hey Pratap how are you doing oh no what's wrong Rachel I'm gonna have to say Rachel a and Rachel P so Chris was so lovely to set up my whole sect and you take care of my whole set down he's got everything rolling for me so let's take this ball out of the way all right so I'm gonna start with the with the mix y'all and you know you can change this you can do it however you want it no I'm saying but it's not necessarily like make them from scratch this [ __ ] thanks so much fine all right now it calls for I knew that was gonna drop so I'm just gonna put this right here right now and let that stay there I knew that YouTube [ __ ] was gonna happen with that phone I need to get me another tripod okay so a quarter ounce milk quarter cup cortico quarter cup quarter cup I need eggs oh he's the best okay so we have two eggs now if you want to make it look more like a cake type feeling number three it says it on the box if I love all the box instructions except for when you add the canvas okay so two eggs I got piece of shell which I'm so good about not doing hey I've been doing that for so long I'm gonna wash my hands y'all got to wash your hands after you use eggs seriously you have no idea how many times but like during cooking you'll try something like you'll just scoop it up with your fingertip and you don't realize that you have like fried egg on there and that's just so always washing into that so hey Jill are you doing my girl so okay so we got our two eggs let's go back down to you Chantal girlfriend Sonya how you guys doing how you doing all right so we're making brownies tonight share my page please thank you I need say I need to be able to like yo you know okay all right so I'm gonna take you back down to the bowl here and so we have that and um all right so we got the water in there the eggs and the last of it I'm gonna use a hybrid tincture that I made if you decide to use if you guys decide to use you can use cooking cash now if you use cooking cash all you're gonna do is throw the cooking ash in there and keep the vegetable oil if you're going to use RSS Oh same thing you're gonna just keep the ingredients the same and just mix it in the RS oh okay a CVD tincture okay this tincture that I'm using here this is like this isn't like hardcore thank you Chantelle my girl love you this isn't strong like this is a mega mega mega strong so I'm using a half a cup which then makes it strong but it also has it makes it more edible and that's one of the things when you're doing edibles that you want to try and make it taste good you know I'm not good that you want good kids to you but but you know like for me I don't really want to tell the difference when I'm eating that like I really have at a hard time I like them the marijuana on my chicken and the way that tastes together but I'm not so keen on when it's like the the cannabis treat is like over dosed with cannabis there's just like this so I don't know I'm not lagging on my side don't worry about if you're lagging okay all right so I'm gonna put in a half a cup okay cool three half a cup I'm gonna use Africa so half a cup is four ounces if you built that firm of it like dispensary depending on what you dispense rates about a hundred and twenty dollars for the for whatever it is what it is but when you're making it home it's so so so so much cheaper all right so I'm gonna go for my half a cup here and that's perfect because I want somebody try this so there's just the perfect amount left over y'all I'm doing this on my Fri it's gonna be fun it's going to be fun it's gonna be fun all right he's a my assistants so he's gonna actually mix it up for me so I don't have to like do this with my hands so we'll show you what goes on there he's my he's so intrigued by it all and it's so great that I don't you know like he's loving doing and being a part of this where nobody else in my world wants to be like no hell no I'm not doing that with you hell no I'm so proud of her nobody else wants to be bothered with you like now although I got me a trimmer who's gonna come in and be helping me yes so I'm gonna I'm back here and I have the United State where Your Honor I have I'm using the 8x8 pan so the last pan and all I'm gonna do is put a little bit of the spray in there just a little bit and then I'm gonna use a paper towel to put it all the way around when you spray it all the way around this so much and think when the cannabis is in something when you cook with tincture if the cannabis can burn if you don't pay attention and so if you put way too much Pam or whatever your nonstick thing is it will it will burn work so you want that to happen so we've already put the oven on so it's just like that just two squirts makes it just very easy I'm gonna take the paper towel and then you just do it right in there and then rub it all around it gives it a nice slick then it's everywhere and then you have don't have any like backlash from that so I don't really like using I don't like to use like a nonstick stuff but you know you have to if you can't get away with it so yo I also got some I ran into a friend yesterday and they had some stuff so yo I got something out of cush oh yo and I'm gonna make some crazy stuff on Friday Caray Zee look how beautiful that's coming out that's so beautiful hey man da who else is that I can't even tell the name Michael hey Michael are you doing love we're making uh marijuana cannabis brownies I've never made cannabis brownies on my show so but it's a simple one and I'm doing a difficult one on Friday so we're going simple tonight that looks good that does all right so I'm gonna come in now and I just want to make sure that for me like I know the consistency and what I want to taste so when you're working with cannabis if if you always less is better but you go with this if you feel like you want to add like thickness to it or water it down you can do both just use a little water to water it down or you can use a little bit more cannabis if you'd like and then to thicken up you want to use some flour not sunflower some flour pretty good is it but I'll have some more all right that seems like that's pretty awesome I'm liking that me too so I love that he loves all my trees I love them all hey Charlotte are you doing my friend all right so now we all we have left to do is throw it into the van here and then put a timer on and then I'm going to talk to you guys for a little bit I'll actually tell you what I'm gonna do on Friday while waiting on this I'll tell you my upcoming things we'll talk about that so we're gonna throw it in the oven [Music] all right so the oven has been preheated I'm throwing it back in the oven I'm not back in the oven hello okay I'm throwing it in the oven hey Siri set timer for 20 minutes all right so I'm gonna try and hook this other camera back up real good just so it's going forward I knew that I knew that the YouTube camera would fall down if the device actually sticks right to my other one but whatever okay I'm going to take another hit while we're waiting because that's not a DAB yo that's not a DAB y'all know I like to take it down that thing is all the way over there wait [ __ ] how y'all doing what's going on with everybody how's everybody feeling I'm grab that waiting sleep things bleeding's okay um so I'm gonna I'm doing the YouTube hi YouTube

a damn voice thank you Michael and Christine so UK England in the house I need to you guys need to we need to work on getting y'all some gummies was that Mary are you doing girl okay so I'll be

just saying I am good Mary welcome welcome welcome yeah I'm definitely starting up the YouTube again so okay so let's talk about what we're gonna do ah what I'm doing I Freddie right right Gabi app so abso-freakin'-lutely um it's gonna recognize the lighter it's my drink no I don't need a cigarette just drink yes okay so y'all we're gonna get a little bit service right now just saying okay so Friday y'all know I'd like to cook like one thing or make one thing that's more spectacular than everything else that's something different well so I've been doing this skincare line right I got my skincare line I got all that stuff and the link will be in the comment section in the in might whatever it is section above I didn't put it in there and I'll put it in YouTube as well and if you go to order off of my website it's it comes as an invoice so just check it out as an invoice and then I send you an inventory awesome awesome Michael okay y'all so one of the things that I saw I've been doing this skincare line right and I've been trying to think about what because I want to do shampoo and Kirsten I were going back and forth we were reading something about menopause and drying up and all of that so I decided to make cannabis KY jelly and like cannabis vagisil so to say so thank you Michael love it I love hanging out and that will come down and jump with me so I'm gonna do that on Friday it's you know it's just one of those things that I was when I came to visit here I left my I don't realize when I go to play people's house like in my home I have wipes that I use after or the bathroom right but I didn't have when I first got here so I was a little irritated from the pants that I was wearing and then that just made it worse so I have been putting the cream in that in my area and he's I think it's better really good so that's my next is doing that I can also make a douche but I'm not so sure about that oh my god Gabi I yes I remember that so cannabis which you know that lubricant should relax your muscles and so where my mind was going with that was when we have fibromyalgia are the female is it's way more sensitive okay hey Alexandra and you know certain pressing and all consistent pressing becomes like an irritating and can be problem but if you can have that area be relaxed so that you're not feeling that you're not feeling any pain that'd be great then on the side of the healing fire part so you guys know I'm all about that healing okay so we made the joke about the KY but I was like sure why not we'll do that and because right now all I have is pretty much all I have is I don't have any tincture left with me so I'm gonna have to use whole cannabis for this flower I'm gonna have to do it from like that type of scratch but I was took the cream the the one that I actually put on my lips I used it downstairs and it feel felt so much better so I'm looking to add in a few other things that will help that situation because the other thing it just has like coconut oil some shea butter or no honey honey wax and beeswax and THC so what I'm looking to do is I am looking to add in some vitamin E aloe vera and there is some natural products that deal with the loss of estrogen and that's one of the reasons why we get dry and it gets irritated down there so that's my next adventure on did you say now they're back they are back gobby gobby that's probably from your illness honey if you have gone through if you have any type of illness that is you know in the I don't know any type of illness because there's such a range amount when it comes to the hot flashes they will come in one wave and then there's actually a different wave because there's - there's there's you're gonna lose two things from that two types of things so you're gonna go and the actually the second time you go around with it it's worse but once it's done it's it on it's over like it's over like one day it will just won't be there anymore I promise you that all right I don't know where my timer is on this thing but it's on my phone so that is the big plan okay that's gonna be my new my new thing and I you know I can get everything in the area and you guys know how I do so that's going to be far I actually said tonight was Friday night earlier I don't know what I was thinking it's freaking Wednesday yeah it's the fibro honey once you get over the menopause the heat on the body gets really really bad if you can afford it you need to go and get a nice vest they're expensive I don't have one of it you know I don't know you should you know what when I'm doing this type of [ __ ] it's but I'm supposed to wear you know that's what we're supposed to do but there that's like go on Amazon it's called cooling vest although I could probably just make one with like ice packs in here and here and back here and as long as this area stays cool the rest of you stays cool so that's a that's a natural way to deal with that Gabi I need to switch you up for that [ __ ] alcohol man we need to sweep get you off of that I'm guessing you would feel a whole lot better when you get pushed off of that y'all I'm lagging I am definitely going to have to work on some type of something for working here although it's should not be like the fact that I'm running off at hours should be fine so that's for my Facebookers my Facebook was just having trouble it's like you can see on top that it says no connection or like limited come in action like what the [ __ ] is limited yeah I get nice best hunting if you can afford it get a nice vest if not make one well I gotta do is keep this this this is all you need don't cover this okay keep your hands your head and your feet uncovered I put a nice vest on oh well I usually do something else though I'm trying to think about it what I used to do back then but it won't it come back sitting abandoned in a vengeance but it'll go away it will it'll just be gone you'll you'll you will ironically you will it will be like you never ever ever had them in the first place but the fibromyalgia can give you the hot flashes too so if you're too warm if you're in a space that's way too warm then you need to get out of that space y'all I am alright I'm lagging the connection is going in and out on the Facebook so I don't know how that's going to work when it goes over I thought I was trying to do some I have frightened them back home but it was doing back home - even with the Wi-Fi so I'm [ __ ] home it's cooking it's looking and see YouTube is fine but the network on my because I have the I have the my phone and they both and my iPad they both have cellular data it's the same [ __ ] they're sitting right on top of each other that might be only problem but I don't know like maybe I don't have it updated or something I know some [ __ ] [Laughter] AT&T I know when I got my tubes chart twisted my tubes with when I got my tubes cut at 23 I kind of went through a menopause then and then I'm 45 now and I started at 41 and so 45 no I mean 46 this month and then so it's been like two years no year and a half a year and a half I'm completely out of it not bad it's not bad once it goes it goes though is looking goo is looking good looking good um okay so I got some banana crush look at this young look at this so huh I'm so sorry you got to go through that Gabi look at how pretty this is this has been a push and that's so pretty I can't I'm want to get back into Jersey I can't just wait to see what my big plant is doing so Friday when I do the when I do the creams and the jellies I'm actually going to be using something different I'm going to be using I'm not gonna be using things sure I'm gonna be actually using the bud material if you want hollow if you want to follow what I'm doing I haven't finished the recipe yet when I finish the recipe I'll put it out if you guys want to get I'll send out the we can do perfume I don't know you know I don't know I don't think it's really good to have perfume that smells like weed although some of them alike they smell like you'll be surprised that they they they smell like pungent pungent weed and then you smoke it and it tastes like a super super sweet berry it's pretty awesome so I am going to be what else on my everything so Friday I'm gonna be doing those lotions and then yes exactly marry I am going home on Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday yo I'll be doing some trimming gotta do some trimming there goes the my timer which I set it at ten minutes early okay and the reason I did that was because one I wanted to stay more a little bit like as a brownie person I like it to be a little bit on the more of a fudge side like a chewy side plus it's the best way when it comes to making cannabis treats you push them to their full cook point you take it out and they get hard super fast I'll have to figure out how to do that Gabby for youtubers Gabby on this side she is talking about making a perfume that is a weave perfume which may not be so bad like if I added like certain sense to it but what's the real value of it like all the things that I try to cook and make have real value to the body so I'm not really sure what kind of value that would add I don't know if I don't know if there would be a big demographic for having weed smelling perfume although it would be a good excuse you can bring out the bottle and go no I don't I don't smoke weed but I like the smell like yes because they do have incense that smell like okay we are getting there it's now getting to the point thank you maybe yeah so we'll have to say I my my next adventure is the the vaginal stuff and [Music] then next week I think I'm gonna do the candles the candles they burn their cannabis candles they burn and then at when they burn the oil that's left in there you can use that as massage oil so and it's actually burns like very nice has a nice texture to it so I'm gonna be making those from home next week maybe Monday I'm not sure yet one of those days whatever days I feel interested to do it I'm gonna make more lozenger they wound up to be so good thank you Mary okay yo those lozenger and I'm so upset that I did not do this for YouTube but I will because I need to make more there's they were so good so they're a one-to-one ratio so I can throw them onto my website if you want them so I'm gonna do that maybe next week next week next week and I make everything fresh for whomever so going on with what all right we're almost done I can't smell it we're almost there this was like in the middle you can see that in the middle if it's like slick it's not really ready yet you smell well compare me my connection on the Facebook is working like [ __ ] man and every is like kind of jumping out and trying to jump back I'm gonna have to do something about that next time me too Gabi me too word so Gabi said she said yes she likes the pot where it's fudged but she likes the corner pieces because she liked the crunchy part too yeah Chris just went oh yeah as we like that we didn't get ice cream tonight we're gonna have to get ice cream tomorrow night to have it but with that yeah that's that's so far my favorite but I'm not I want to do the fudge someone gave me a recipe for fudge and I don't freak there was a lot a lot of ingredients and I don't like using a ton of ingredients it's too much work for people oh yeah you're right Mary you're right Mary that's that's definitely it yeah it's just so then most people from here but I've been experiencing it from home too like I didn't have a problem for a good long time but then I I was taking it off a Wi-Fi because of the way my house is built I'm not in my house right now I'm in my boyfriend's house so like I don't even know if I'm saying but Friday we're gonna do some good wood wood wood we use almost thank you yes best of horse both worlds exactly absolutely absolutely and you know I was really having trouble with the idea of working with my edibles and like continued to eat healthy so I think I'm gonna go even though if I put cannabis in all my junk food I actually lose weight by I don't I don't thrive or hope cookies and stuff like that type of stuff but I would to like to make it into a smoothie so and you know me with that that would be a lot of ingredients you know when you guys go down to the bear or whatever my recipe is you can you know follow it there but me I go and add some another few things which i think just is naturally happening at this point having to do it so step thank you god yeah I'm trying I mean I can't believe in all these times I've been doing so many I've done so many lives and not one time if I could [ __ ] brownies how the hell did that happen I'm telling you I don't know how that happened I don't know it managed to happen that's just ridiculous but also I'm gonna travel up to [Music] Pennsylvania where Rachel elack's is going to do trebles cuz I really want to like broaden my horizons a little bit on this you know I don't know like I want it to be simple so that it's a simple recipe and people who don't have trouble following it but I want to also have something that's you know like that if you make it you actually want to have it there's a lot of times I'll make like a batch of cookies and then the cookie is like comes out weird and then I don't even want to eat it even if it's not right you know what also I haven't done I haven't done caramels I've not done that yet so that's something else I gotta get I ain't know all right pop brownies is amazing us I hadn't frickin what the hell haven't made them the whole time it's the only box that was an out but I was like oh I'm gonna make this then I'm gonna make this sound I make this enema make this totally rolled over it oh molten lava cake that sounds good yo all right just about two more minutes because like it's getting like a dark-brown up close to the close to those edges so I'm gonna give it two more minutes and then it's over for that when you're using tincture or you're using now when you're using tincture as your cannabis the cannabis that you're gonna use so I'm gonna fuse that can burn so if when it's on the outside it will kind of air in there hey Matt what's going on man how you doing we're cooking pot brownies so anyways just got like one more minute and y'all I'm actually gonna cook on Friday with regular buds that's so I never do that but that is definitely something that I have learned and I want to be able to share that with you guys and I think it's interesting and well you know what the thing is the last few months where I've gotten like really pulling up on all my cooking my harvests haven't been that [ __ ] great so I'm like using them as it's almost useless cabbie you killing me all right Cheers I'm just doing this right back yeah I think it's too late and I don't not sure if it might need a little bit more to like do the ending it really although I don't know if I I round it up enough all right there's a guy on line that I watched and he like makes fun of videos he makes fun of people's dumbass videos and he goes he's from um I don't remember fees from South Africa or like an island I think it's South Africa and he speaks really good English so I'm thinking South Africa but I love the way he is so cool all right I think we're gonna be done and [Music] we got candles inside alright I'm gonna give it two more minutes oompah is as best as I'm gonna be able to say your name sweetheart I'm so sorry I can't pronounce your name uh-huh um yeah definitely a few moments I put it on my finger like it was hot not half of my mouth hot for my fingers so I'm gonna let that run a couple of more minutes [Music] it said did say 20 it was 29 27 minutes to 31 minutes or something like that so um if y'all have some ideas definitely like send me a message look good look it look it so Chris he got had all these rips me but to figure out how to make because I want to try and add it into my dare which I haven't I did start doing I made the rub I made the some flour olive oil but I don't like making things I always don't like what if I'm gonna teach something I want to be able to see something that doesn't have too many ingredients because most of our us are on medical marijuana and a ton of other [ __ ] which makes us only capable to look after three items three ingredients so but what happened was so if I show you this and that's just so awesome that he's like looking out for me right so when you hold it open like this and he has you know like all men have these types of recipe books in the house and now I'm not big on doing like I don't you know this is all kind of new to me but what I can do is was it in this book different book show you what I'm talking about okay so like this all right what is this even oh these upside-down cakes okay hey man I know looking sucks okay they have all these ingredients I'll always have that so I can do is I can actually look at the PO ooh I know how to make that I own mind so usually with this SP recipe working some different so this was awesome so awesome looking ago you know what I like a diet book which I actually like the recipes from from the big fat loser or the big whatever it is Sancho I have that one so we'll be able to see some friends as to follow I don't want to say that cuz that that dude stays that I know some time talking for a half an hour which straight this one [ __ ] lose my boys that's why next time I come to Cleveland Chris so we're gonna like try and work on that I I can't I can't and we both we both use our voices for business so we have to have our is always an issue with everything like if they're gonna pump up the Tim cellular towers can we like phase out the the fuzz hey oh my goodness that was oh I could never imagine how you would crack in half dammit let's go to room I'm mamma's over oh my goodness hey Nicole what's going on my friend Brody back gotcha gotcha

what I'm holding this thing so about ten o'clock is when I decided to bed cuz I started feeling so weird I couldn't walk hey if i walk i will take a shot going to the wall I thought pretty much hot as [ __ ] but not too high a yeasty I'm you see the high as like laughing and everything else but anyways so about ten euros watching TV and I sucking bad thoughts the high side kicking her like crazy

was sticking my head like I was thinking lick me in the hospital dying or something and thats guilt this [ __ ] out me well it's high like that and um so not like [ __ ] I gotta get up cuz i can't go bed you know cuz i was scared to death and then um [ __ ] spunk flow I spin mudjug and anyways and I I got up and I ran out of my [ __ ] I gotta dress if I won't go says so when I got just and I had to give up if I was dehydrated it wasn't fun at all and then if I weren't serious could barely walk shanti act normal that's more like setting on couch with my dad and uh uh about was watching a show called dead old life and I see about 20 minutes later I fell asleep he wakes me up and said you've been asleep for 20 minutes I was like all right haven't watched TV die so that I guess I still got the whole time I can see TV but this was asleep and um sir I woke up and we watched his home TV and then he went I said shut shut everything off and I had cup of water in my hand I was sitting there and I spilled some water flow and that and he hold it he he said walking stairs I started throwing up everywhere I called me on couch on the floor no flow we have a wooden floor up says since he done his couch and he's pissed about that and then also I can't move says no I couldn't move I can move my hand leave my head so then he saw some nothing like she I at your mom so he went in his room and got my mom and mom comes up and says a song I'm like I want to tell you but I brownie and showing you is why I said winding shown you is edible and so say candy drugs I swim so she said so then I after that uh she's like new to the couch so I I could barely get up and I find on myself to get up move to the other couch and showing you me move again every time i tried to move the thought i was gonna throw up even more so i finally got to the other couch and at that time about i went by and my mom is sam out there making sure I was gonna die my dad is out there and being such tennis story about me throwing up and how I was leaning over a like gagging well about that small he was he was a great deal cuz you know well while starting up he's waiting on telemedicine well not last hung up when i was about to then hes tle please funny it was how I was like so laughing my ass off but in my face like serious and then oh yeah so but then that thoughts I happening and when I had two bad thoughts they stuck in my head not a [ __ ] but then I thought to do up and stuff I started to feel better but this is when y'all done my mom and dad leading killer I tried I brownie they did but they're like you don't try things during your teenager then in the morning I you know I fell asleep I know twelve o'clock and upstairs and guess I ain't tired do you wanna go bed now and I was like no one's gonna sleep here he's like okay that was a walsh mistake I made I she went downstairs I'm gonna sleep and um because my phone was downstairs I don't have a pass code on my phone I get idiot and so my dad goes downstairs in the morning and goes to my phone sees that I sold the kayak his kayak saw his old on my book and seen all the messages from me my friend saying amen i want to buy these lines like 10 bucks oh well and we did talk about how these drugs i don't worry won't get into not drugs at all not like helling anything i just had yours trims mushrooms there's only four sunshine I not try it but um so they took my phone take screenshots texted my friend from my mom's tone my friends free closer he's like yes ma'am I understand I won't touch the song again I won't do anything like that so I would have my phone back if I didn't sell that [ __ ] the well honey then we came up with it they did but anyway shiz things went up kid so Hornstein guys don't try to eat a huge brownie like I did like definitely because it was a very high percentage of THC it sucked if I could describe it it felt like I was on shrooms I did take my phone I was like dude it physical on shoes right now yeah my phone was like I'm in your house sounds like [ __ ] yeah he's just messing about he's like a man come bring a sandwich I'm sorry I know I was like dude I'm freaking out don't say that and what stuff and so they got all my messages and I saw that stuff and then uh you know I was like [ __ ] so like maybe if i pay my mom I 200 bucks when she was so careful then actually uh yeah I should give my phone back I can't get my phone back there I thought if I'm not using my mom's old phone that i took from her he doesn't kill you know he's like just a lady dad's here but then you know I was pissed off that they took advantage of the situation and went through my phone Ross was passed out and when it's tough so now I was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] so I went outside I was like I got my truck put his clothes to my dad's truck got his big ass trailer muscled it in front of his truck hooked up hooked up our fathers trillion other chains so the show falls off the truck he shared with severe ties to the truck those two Chainz I hooked under his truck not so like if you try to leave it whip off his bumper but just get mad then I put logs under my mom's car cuz I was pissed yeah it was just about making him mad and I wasn't [ __ ] you know my mom's pretty cool on with that till my dad's put him mean so you know I noobs tasing for my moms called put under my dad's church and then his piss I are disconnected is a what's called he's a pisco pillow and I just connected all the walls under the desk so here I've going to connect all them back just getting mad precisely Ned but that is definitely more my other mistakes because now I can get my phone back to 30th I think I always said that but um I just like a guy like 10 more days left it just happened couple days ago and all this stuff guys I was like I'm going to leave I'm gonna go to my friend's house someone I also my parents as I was like I'm gonna leave I'm gonna go to more my friend says i'll come back to 30th when i get my phone back and I was like you leave on corn cobs because I don't have my license I can't drive my truck but when I was coming out of the driveway to move behind my dad's truck um my truck died oh my [ __ ] did I I'm out of gas I can't go anywhere I signed enough gas to actually move it a little bit more and i got my god gallon gas point my gas think so but they really want to leave then you know i have more money i was going to a gas station fill up and then you know and I was like I call cause he gonna pull you over I was like I know the back goes beyond him I finds that bones I could pop my candy awesome also put my mom texted my friends and all this stuff it sucked so there's one thing I tell you guys don't shy eat a big brownie and then make such a choice by

please like and subscribe thanks", "e5pxuvwpskI": "all right what is going on you guys welcome back to another little YouTube video today I'm gonna tell you guys a story today I haven't told a story in a really long time I have the funniest stories guys but I've just been making vlogs for a really long time now and I've just decided to kind of stick with that my channel is kind of like based around story time videos like a really long time ago like two years ago and I'd kind of just quit that for no reason and I don't know why this story takes place in 2016 to kind of like give you guys like a reference of where that was in my life I had just gotten suspended for the rest of the year in March so I had like an eight month gap in my life where it was just lit all the time we were just doing fun stuff I was just making vlogs I was 14 about to turn 15 the best summer of my life this story kind of involves my dog right here this is my precious baby Nala never seen her before she's my absolute best friend I've had her for almost three years now she just turned 3 a couple weeks ago and this was her first experience with drugs I don't know where she got these drugs but anyways it was an edible it was like a pot brownie well not one pot brownie it was like a whole entire like square tray I don't know how she got her hands on the whole tray of pot brownies that's out of the picture I don't know where that came from I personally do not like smoke weed or eat pot brownies just not for me I don't really like it I think anyone that smokes weed is honestly a piece of [ __ ] I hate weed I really hate weed I'm pretty sure they were left outside for some reason by a person we won't name I don't know who left him outside I think knowledge just called a perk dope dealer and she was doing illegal things and I had to get her on the right track now she's better she's completely sober she was addicted for a little bit to the pot brownies those pot brownies will get you so now I'll decide to eat a whole tray of pot brownies I had no idea this was going down usually I have my dog more supervised than that but me my brother and his girlfriend took a trip to the beach just go hang out chill for a day we're at the beach we're just chilling and we get a call from my mom who's still at home with Nala and she is freaking the [ __ ] out think about if like a human ate a whole thing of pot brownies you'd be pretty [ __ ] up you're gonna be gone like I don't I've never done it before but I mean usually people just see one and they're pretty strong and then sewn all up hey like 75 pound dog ate a whole plate of them probably like eight pot brownies I don't even know my mom is like freaking out on the phone she's like actually looks like she's gonna die their tongue is hanging out her eyes are all red she's walking sideways I don't know what's wrong with theirs you never know a name she's like about to call the vet and stuff and like getting all a snitched out so like mom I'm pretty sure they got into the pot brownies you're like mom chill so at this point I'm kind of scared to like fur Nala cuz like eight pot brownies to a little dog might not be that good for her weed which is probably not good for dogs chocolate which is definitely not good for dogs home from the beach and Nala is laying in the yard like up like this like she's like I'll show you what it looks like she does this often but it was just like she's just like having the best time she's rolling around and [ __ ] and she's like I'm like no I come here and then she like stumbles over and I'm like oh my god like knowledge [ __ ] up out of her mind Nala do you remember this [ __ ] do you remember being [ __ ] up out of your mind look at her guys she's such a bad dog little stoner dog she just walked up to me and was just wagging her tail so much she was so happy to see me so when my mom said that Nala was walking sideways I thought she was just like tumbling or something or going like over there a little bit but she said she was walking sideways she meant it quite literally like she was walking like this I don't know what the [ __ ] was going on but like picture this as like a dog she was like she was like I'm like I'm like I don't think that's the best representation of it but you guys kind of get the picture so as she's walking sideways I was a little concerned for her health but she didn't seem like too bad she was just really [ __ ] high she sleeps for like 16 hours there's some [ __ ] like that like she just wouldn't wake up and I was just like alright well her heart's still beating so like she's fine right hopefully what the [ __ ] are we gonna do tell the vet that the dog got into pop brownies and then get arrested because it's like you know CPS for dogs might come yo you gave your kid drugs I don't want that to happen I mean she's fine not like she's good like nothing bad happened but at this point she's still hide the next day and I'm like [ __ ] that's probably not good like if you're high for a really long time most likely not good especially a dog she's hide the rest of the day her like actions just don't even change but she's still obviously baked out of her mind that day goes by she sleeps for another like 12 hours there's some [ __ ] like that she wakes up the next day she's still high I'm kind of freaking out right now because like she's still the same amount of high as she was on the first day so I'm thinking like like did is she gonna be high for the rest of her life did like did I just break my dog I was worrying I genuinely thought she was gonna be high for a really long time but I was like oh [ __ ] I wasn't monitoring my child and she onto some pot brownies and now she's [ __ ] high for the rest of your life I felt like such a bad dad couple days later she was fine she wasn't high anymore so I was like okay nice we're gonna keep popping on his way from now on cuz obviously they're not good for her and yeah that was a knowledge first experience with table brownies and I've done a good job of keeping her away from Papa Bear knees ever since or weed or heroin or coke or Molly or acid or shrooms or anything like that she hasn't been doing it she's completely sober she's a drink beer actually she got into the beer once my neighbor's beard that he had just chilling outside and like she cracked up a cold one with the boys I got her signed up for rehab she's all good now she's completely sober yeah I look at her you guys would know guilty she knows she got into the pot brownies and she's ashamed of yourself you guys have any similar stories if maybe your first drug story or maybe your dog's first drug story or anything like that leave them down in the comments I might like look through them and it'll probably be pretty funny I don't know leave it down in the comment but yeah guys that is gonna be for the video I really do hope you enjoyed if you did enjoy and you want to see more story time

modern network is bringing to you daily videos of any type of news whether it be comic book movie videogame anything to tickle your nerd bum tickle your nerd bone sheboygan with you today number 30 and I'm gonna talk about Minecraft no I can't talk about Minecraft that's more aggressive the gresham suit he's dedicated many many many hours playing that game and I just can't do it but the little tidbit of information i will give you about minecraft is sometime in august for those of you who are dedicated you will be able to get your hands on it on the ps4 the PlayStation Vita and the xbox one yes it's going next gen for the next gen the Lego game is going to the next gen consoles yay do you see that excitement that was excitement but I'm not gonna talk about Minecraft today and I'm honestly not going to talk about gaming news or anything really what we typically would talk about just because it's been pretty slow here in the industry lately I know in a couple weeks III will be on and will be booming with gaming news then but other than you know Batman and Superman announced halo 5 announced and the Arkham Knight new trailer there really hasn't been much that we haven't touched base on already so I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about something called marijuana now don't get me wrong this video is not posted because I condone the usage or does anybody from modern condone the usage of drugs but we just came across this news and we just found it deeply interesting something that was slightly humorous and was very entertaining we r wilson most some of us from this network are from the great and glorious state of texas where every day's t shirt and short weather because the humidity is going to kill you if you wear pants and long sleeves it's just inevitable so hot hot but in the lovely city of Little Rock Texas they have arrested a 19 year old named Jacob lavarro and will then could possibly sentence him to a life sentence imprisonment now you ask what did he do to deserve this did he kill somebody did he rape somebody did he do something to desecrate the nation no Jacob lavarro merely sold the hash brownies for twenty-five dollars a pop when they raided his home and confiscated all of his stuff they found 691 pounds of hash brownies and were attempting to sentence him into imprisonment for life now the reasoning behind this was because they could merely not separate the illegal substance from the actual brownies substance so they couldn't determine how much he was actually used and he was using a THC based oil when he made the brownies so they cannot determine how much substance was actually in the brownies to determine how long they could sentence him for now is he likely gonna get sentenced to life sentence no no they're actually talking about a plea bargain now so just the fact that this glorious state of Texas can turn something as small as that which I mean yes the distribution of the legal substances is wrong and you should be punished for but to take something small like that and turn it into something that can can be compared to murder is just hilarious in my opinion and just proves how great the state of Texas is and so I'd leave you on this know what do you think what do you think about legal substances I mean are you for them being legal do you think it's better for society if they're legal

control of his bladder and his heart rate was frightening lilo so vets induced vomiting in an attempt to get any of the cookie out of the dog's stomach and put him on an IV to keep fluids in his

American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals emergency calls related to pets eating cannabis products has surged 765 percent over the past 10 years alone and as more states continue to

"FlHdu6bjj8w": "yo guys what's up welcome to the video so in this video I'm making some triple chocolate fudge wax edibles and these are gonna be cupcakes so I'm going to use one gram of wax we got the Saturn og here today it's a hybrid and I'm using just about point one for edible I'm stretching this and making about twelve edibles which you can do as well so anyways first what you're gonna do is you're gonna follow the directions on the box and make the mix as I did here after that you want to make sure you don't use the oil for your mix yet so if it calls for butter or coconut oil or vegetable oil don't use that yet set it aside so next you're gonna set your oven to 250 degrees and then freeze your wax so my wax was already frozen I had it pretty ready so what I'm gonna do is take this wax and split it up into this little glass bowl that can go into the oven and it's kind of hard with one hand as you can see I was using one hand to kind of just break it up I also put coconut oil in the bottom of the dish so the wax doesn't stick as much so that's really optional but I'm gonna put it in at 250 degrees we're gonna put this in for just about 5 to 10 minutes I found putting it in for about seven to eight minutes is just about the right spot so let's do this and I'm gonna check back once it's done all right so the wax is done obviously and I'm just gonna check this out what we're gonna do is take the oil and we're gonna mix it in here so I'm gonna cut the video again it's all mixed up as you can see there's chocolate in it because the little spatula I used right here there was a lot of chocolate on it so next step fades into a nice easy step you're just gonna take the wax oil the can of oil the wax oil and you're just gonna mix it in gradually and evenly mix it in so what I did is I did a little little pour and then mix it and then another little pour and then mix it again so here I am mixing it up and this is gonna be a couple seconds of me mixing it just to make sure this was me making my point make sure you mix it a lot you don't want one edible to be way stronger than another edible so that's a big fact that you want to definitely mix it up a lot so after you're done mixing we're just gonna pour it on into the [ __ ] tray and we're gonna get ready to bake get ready to bake get ready to get baked so you take this and you put it in the oven at whatever temperature the recipe calls for for this recipe it called fridge actually I think I called for 350 degrees so there it is in everything's done now we wait now here is the finished product of these edibles I've literally just finished making them hopped on the mic to make this video and take a look at these chocolatey cakey cupcakes these look so good I'm not gonna put icing on it personally I think icing kind of ruins cupcakes but if you take a look at these they look super big these are gonna be really good edibles like I said it's the Saturn og so with the Saturn og it kind of makes you feel like your body's here down on earth mine's up at Saturn so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did leave a like I'll see you guys later peace you", "WWHzW6PadtU": "welcome to episode 7 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tommy Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist looking looking you just beside the wall Soni in today's episode we're gonna learn how to make rice crispy treat we're gonna use rice krispies but you can use any of these cereals so cool today's episode is sponsored by black-market marijuana support your local ganja preneur a friend with weed is a friend indeed for your edibles you can use Keith's good ol mary-jane BHO or cannabutter if you have we're using cannabis that's the bottom rack did today's recipe only requires a few ingredients we have Rice Krispies cereal a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows you can use either mini marshmallows or regular-sized marshmallows we have some kosher salt some vegetable spray and if you'd like you can use food coloring I could use a little color let's start the recipe we need to find a way to get the weed to the paper [Music] we're gonna start really simple we're gonna turn our stove on to low I'm using my induction cooktop but if you're using the stovetop you just want to make sure you use a heavy bottomed pan and set your temperature on low some people don't like it as cold as I do but I don't care so I've already measured these this is our homemade cannabutter you're gonna use four tablespoons of your butter or a quarter of a cup you want to make sure your butter melts completely before you add the marshmallow make sure to spray your spatula with some vegetable spray that'll ensure that once you add the marshmallows it doesn't stick - looks like our canna butter is already melted we're gonna go ahead and open the marshmallows and put them right in what is this gluttonous monstrosity before me add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows or again regular marshmallows and if you happen to make your own marshmallows it's actually be about 12 ounces or a cup and a half let's go ahead and add these I know it looks like a lot of marshmallows but it definitely is going to melt down you want to make sure to continuously stir this once everything has melted we'll take it off the heat and we'll add the rice krispies cereal the reason why I use mini marshmallows is because I find that they melt a lot quicker than a regular-sized marshmallows you want to continuously stir it so that all the marshmallows melts evenly this is not the kind of thing that you walk away from you want to constantly stir it and watch it to make sure it doesn't burn now once this is completely melted we're going to take it off the stove and we'll add the rice krispies cereal at that time if you wanted to add food coloring you could or if you wanted to add any kind of chocolate chips or sprinkles or something like that you could do it at that time too now once this is done some people like to move the marshmallow mixture into a separate Bowl and mix the rice krispies into it but I've picked a large enough pan where I can just go ahead and add it directly to the pan and I definitely recommend that you want a nice wide pot so that all the rice crispy cereal fits into it and it's just easier to mix the marshmallows have completely melted I'm going to turn this off and pull it away from the heat and you got to say how many marshmallows he can fit into your mouth here we have 6 cups of rice krispies I'm just gonna add it to the marshmallow remember we've removed it off of the heat so we're gonna just put that right in there and to this I'm also going to add a quarter of a teaspoon of kosher salt anytime you make anything sweet or anything really when you add salt it really brings out the flavor in it if you wanted to you could add food coloring as well but I'm not going to whatever those rules aren't real and as you can see some of the Rice Krispies are dry and some of them are getting some of that delicious marshmallow so you really just want to work it let me work it so that all of the Rice Krispies cereal is coated with that yummy cannabutter marshmallow mixture that we made I want to make sure that all of the rice krispies are nice and coated a good indication of that is they kind of have a nice Sheen to it or shine what I see no more shines maybe you didn't hear about it you've been away a long time didn't go up that day and that's how you know that the marshmallow has covered every little last speck and that will have nice adhesion last thing you want to do is have your rice krispies treat fall apart on either no napkins or nothing you do like this you like that so again you can do this with any cereal Froot Loops fruity pebbles even Kashi if you wanted to do a healthier version ain't nobody got time for this so as you can see here everything is very nicely coated and what you want to do here is work fast we're gonna take this away and then we'll get a 9 by 13 pan that we will also spray with vegetable spray and we're going to put all those rice krispies right in there you want a normal size or a big fatty Oh every little inch of this you will really want to give it a nice coating because once the rice krispies is dry it'll make it easier to pop them right out pop pop pop pop now we're just gonna go ahead and sum all of this right in here really the part that gets tricky is putting this into this mold what I usually do is I start off with the spatula and then I will go ahead and spray my hands and press it in to the pan I find it does a better job so here we go all right and if you can see that makes it a lot easier with the [ __ ] dog man you can also do these in the sheet pan if you wanted to make thinner rice krispies and I have a rolling pin that I use and since the sheet pan is a lot flatter I usually just take the rolling pin and just roll it right over what the heck are you talking about these are what they look like when they're completely pressed into the pan and since they're still warm we're gonna decorate them with some sprinkles since it's 4/20 we're gonna go ahead and use purple in green light green sprinkles give it a nice green luminescent look to it and then we're gonna add some purple as well we've allowed the Rice Krispies cereal treats to cool down and what you're gonna do is you're going to either use a knife or I'm actually gonna use an offset spatula a what I want to do is you want to just Anderson it around the edges this should come out pretty easily since we already greased the pan I'm just gonna flip this over the Silpat that I have underneath it has measurements on it which will allow me to cut this fairly precisely fingers crossed oh it's fine that a serrated knife cuts it really smoothly so you want to try to cut them as evenly as possible it doesn't have to be perfect they're gonna taste amazing I wish that I could make a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat happy I finished cutting all the rice krispies treats if you'd like you can put them away by wrapping them individually in plastic wrap and that'll make them last longer in this house they won't last that long I just like to put them on a plate they look so delicious and they're really soft to the touch but they have like a nice stiffness to it well you know what we don't need to put this one on there there's plenty but I just want to show you here we have our delicious rice krispies treat 200 milligrams six of these you have this beautiful sheen from the marshmallow and the can of butter you have this nice denseness from when we pressed all those rice krispies together you still have a little bit of the chewiness and that give yeah Jesus Christ have you ever heard of don't get high on

this is not for you no chocolate for your doggie [Music] you", "xccbd2vkQRE": "what is up cannafam and welcome back to another video so check it out guys for this video i'm gonna be taking some edibles i said it i'm gonna do it i i know i know before we get into this i know that oregon edibles are pretty much almost trash okay i'm just gonna be honest like look let's just be honest let's just call a spade a spade oregon edibles are not that good okay they may taste great you may find some good ones that taste super delicious and awesome and you know all fancy and whatnot but the fact of the matter is 50 milligram uh limit for recreational here in the state of oregon is [ __ ] it is [ __ ] okay it is 110 [ __ ] if you are somebody that's needing higher dosage if you are a medical patient that's needing a higher dosage um you have to buy like multiple packs and [ __ ] like that's ridiculous that's ridiculous not only is buying just multiple of these super expensive you know but you can get diabetes i should you not just because it has wheat in it doesn't mean you can't get diabetes it's just a bunch of junk food all right so for this video if you haven't guessed already we got edibles okay so uh i have three 50 milligram uh rice krispie bites these are little bites rice krispies i got two chocolate one regular and then i also have um two gummies here by buddies all right these are like little square gummies that you can eat and again each of these have 50 milligrams in it so we got 100 250 milligrams and that's what we're going to take this morning now i know there might be some people on here that are like bruh i take like a thousand milligrams this ain't [ __ ] this is weak sauce whatever okay i get it i i i'd have to spend like probably close to 50 or more bucks if i wanted 100 milligrams so uh i'm just dealing with 250 uh now um i have not smoked at all this is it's early in the morning it's still eight o'clock in the morning um i have not smoked i haven't taken any dabs haven't smoked any flour haven't done any of that so um this is going to be my first high of the day i wanted to do this so i could actually try to feel the effects okay because i have a high tolerance um usually you know a couple hundred milligrams doesn't really affect me much okay you really don't really feel it much but um nonetheless we will we will take these edibles all right so we got the two here we got the cherry and we got the watermelon uh this watermelon is shishka berry blue dream terps and it is an indica with 45 milligrams 45 what the [ __ ] not even a full 50 what the [ __ ] uh this one is shishkenberry and pineapple terps and this is also an indica and this is the cherry okay and 45 or some percent 45 milligrams on this as well so technically not the full 50 that's kind of bunk that's kind of [ __ ] to me um the fact that you can't get a it's 50 milligrams it's it's 50. like come on like what the [ __ ] dude it's already not that much to begin with and now it's even less oh that that's already an automatic strike in my book i'm sorry you could sit here and argue well it's hard to get animals to 50 and i don't give a [ __ ] i'll give a [ __ ] what your reason story or excuses [ __ ] that 50 milligrams come on it's not that much guys we're paying this amount for this kind of [ __ ] anyway 50 milligrams one of these gummies ain't gonna do [ __ ] to most owners both of these gummies honestly you can most most cannabis users most daily cannabis users can eat both of these and they're not gonna feel [ __ ] this isn't gonna do [ __ ] okay that's the problem and one of the reasons is is because it's not the full milligrams it's always [ __ ] some kind of percent shot it's either 40 45 whatever just get the 50. that's the point i'm trying to make [ __ ] all right eating me my emo kids try everybody so let's go with this one watermelon all right so i really do like watermelon and um it's probably one of my favorite flavors to be honest open this up got a nice little squishy gummy look at that nice little squishy gummy sugared nice little gummy let's do it [Music] not bad not bad at all very easy goes down smooth like um it's not hard very chewy i like it however the watermelon flavor you kind of get it at first but it goes away really fast and then you're kind of stuck with like a dab flavor almost i don't know that's crazy um i wonder if it says what they use i'm wondering if they use um like bho or rso or distillate i'm wondering what they make or how they made this product but it doesn't tell me on the back here on all the information here on the back unfortunately that kind of sucks all right so cherry and it's again pretty much the same you know nice and soft chewy sugar coated [Music] um the cherry flavor was a little bit stronger than the watermelon not by much not by much but just a little bit stronger on the flavor than the watermelon so that's not bad now uh for these buddies uh one one gummy uh edibles uh i paid six dollars a gram for the cram i paid six dollars a gram i paid six dollars in edible for this okay you guys can see that up here at the top six dollars which i guess isn't bad for like a nice little bite size edible but still i remember when um 50 milligrams used to be like five bucks i don't know but anyway i guess that's close six bucks right so that's that's pretty much close you're paying the extra dollar for the packaging that's what it is you pay the five dollars for the 50 milligrams and then you pay the extra dollar for the packaging so we figured it out anyway let's get on to these crispies all right guys so i think um what we're gonna do here is since we only have one of the regular i think we're gonna save this for last and we'll probably start with these chocolates right here so these are bite-sized rice krispie treats which i kind of prefer them to be bite-sized to be honest just because i don't want to eat for if it was more milligrams if it was like a hundred two three four hundred whatever [ __ ] milligrams i wouldn't mind eating you know normal-sized rice krispies but for just 50 [ __ ] milligrams like yeah it needs to be bite-sized okay it needs to be just good now i got my milligrams all right so these are also are they all yep oh no this one's 47 okay so this is 47 milligrams these are 45. so again same complaint as the last ones what the [ __ ] okay what the [ __ ] can a crispy like what the [ __ ] work harder at getting to that 50 milligram i'm sorry and again i know there'll be some people that will comment and be like well dude you don't make edibles you don't know what you're talking about it's it's super hard to get exactly 50 on point blah blah blah blah blah we're not allowed to be one over i don't give a [ __ ] okay all that [ __ ] that you say is just reason stories and excuses to me okay just get it handled just do it it's 50 milligrams it's not that [ __ ] hard okay this is as far as edible goes that's all we can get like stop depriving us of what we need all right so again we're gonna do the chocolate first save the regular for last now these are also six dollars for edible so that's not too bad all right all right nice little square oh i want to talk with my mouth full these are good you don't really taste any of the the dabs or weed or whatever they use for this um however it is a little dry like it is a i don't want to say stale because it's not it's not stale it doesn't taste that way but it is a little dry man it just sucks it just sucks i have to eat all this you know what i mean it just sucks and i have to eat all this because a it's for it you know it's early still in the morning to be eating a bunch of sugar this early in the morning it's gonna be rough um and and b it's like so many pieces of sugar you know what i mean like i have to sit here and eat five pieces and [ __ ] i mean i just um i just wish that you know you could get like one of these just one just like this but it'd be the 250 300 milligrams that we're trying to get here sucks so if you're in a state if you are in a state that has edibles that go above you know 50 or 100 consider yourself lucky okay don't take that [ __ ] for granted because you could be in the state of oregon and even though yeah we have you know good dabs and uh good flour and stuff like that and good prices we have the best prices in the nation um edible game is [ __ ] don't come here for edibles okay you're gonna be highly disappointed if you're an edible person if that's your main stick and you come here you you take the trip you spend all that money come here for edibles and then you realize 50 milligrams not even 45 milligrams and um yeah you got to buy like 10 of them that's crazy it's not bad but you can definitely um have some kind of like a oh always some kind of dab taste i want to say like distill it i don't know but you can definitely there's like a funky little aftertaste with it oh it's not bad but that part was a little hard doubly hmm on that one damn so the chocolates taste okay it's not super chocolaty but you know i mean it does taste like a cocoa rice krispie treat now regular flavor rice krispie treats are some of my favorite okay they're probably one of my favorite type of edibles i also love brownies so rice krispie treats and brownies are probably my favorite edibles although there you can you can medicate almost anything so i mean to be able to have like super delicious food medicated that is awesome um let me know in the comment section below on this video what your favorite edible is okay what is your favorite kind of edible and not only that but let me know what is the highest milligram of edible that you've ever had in your life what is the highest milligrams you have ever taken for me the highest milligram is 1600. um if you if you're willing to scroll down way you know years like probably 2015 it's yeah years years if you're willing to scroll through years of videos you'll find the edible video we did um on the edible lollipop that was 1600 milligrams so that's probably the highest i've ever taken but anyway cheers guys much love you know what's funny is you eat right you eat edibles and then maybe in like 30 40 minutes you're hungry like super hungry you're like [ __ ] i just ate some bunch of edibles and just ate like [ __ ] bunch of edibles but um i could definitely eat a pizza and a steak and some chips right now anyway i just thought that was funny it's a little rough some parts come on finally okay here we go it is all now in my gullet and now we have to wait for the effects all right now i will do like a follow-up i know uh anytime i've done edible videos there's always some people complaining like hey this guy got so high he forgot to even follow up and tell us how it was you know what i mean and that's not the case i guarantee you that um what it mainly is is in my other videos if i don't come back and do like a follow-up and be like hey guys i'm [ __ ] high this is great um it means that i didn't feel it it means that i didn't get me high i know that uh i've done these can of crispy video i've done a video on these can of crispies before and um i know there's some people on there they're like hey why didn't you follow up with us we wanted to know how the high was and it's because it didn't really get me that high and that's not knocking the edibles that's not saying that you know the 50 milligrams whatever uh that's just saying like hey i need more than 150 200 milligrams in order to feel it so well i feel at this time i don't know this is one of the things that i made sure that i didn't smoke anything i didn't no dabs no flour no none of that this morning straight edibles so that way if i am gonna feel it it's gonna be now you know what i mean like there's no other better time that in the morning before you've had anything else to you know take some edibles and get the true effects of the edibles the true effects and um yeah so we take them all or we took them all we take them took them whatever um but yeah they're all gone and um yeah we're gonna see how this feels so i will do a follow-up even if it doesn't affect me i will still do a follow-up and i'll just be like hey guys look i'm i'm still just me just sober so anyway be sure to

take indica edibles okay indica dominant edibles in the morning make sure you get those sativas like seriously that was uh that was quite an experience i mean i know i know it was only 250 milligrams i know that's not a lot to some people however uh taking it first thing in the morning before smoking anything else and all that kind of stuff and the fact that it was indica like they were indica edibles indica dominant that was a mistake i'll probably never make again like i'm gonna be honest like i just passed out probably about an hour and a half after taking all the edibles i was just like you know what i mean like i was like whoa indica [ __ ] um but nonetheless they uh were pretty good edibles especially for the price so 6.50 milligrams that's not too bad so let me know what you guys think in the comment section below the high was nice they did do the job uh it kind of sucks that you got to take so many of them but they did do the job um so yeah that is my full review on the

bad trip ending up in hospital now they're suspended the raid on the dispensary happened overnight Saturday what's not clear is when the evidence edible marijuana was stolen but the two officers allegedly took it and then went back to the station with it and though not in uniform they were still on duty and that's when they ate it apparently the cannabis products had a strong effect so strong in fact that the men started hallucinating one of the officers then made an officer needs assistance call which can lead to a full response by all officers in the area now when they did arrive one of the responding officers slipped on ice and had to be treated for a head injury as for the two officers who had ingested the edible marijuana product they had to be treated in hospital City News has

right his owner says her 10 year old golden retriever found the edible marijuana left over from 4/20 while on a walk in the neighborhood the dog's owner says she noticed she was having trouble getting down the stairs and her legs didn't quite work right she took her to a vet who diagnosed the symptoms right away they seemed drunk high enough is mainly what you'll see is a dog that's a little depressed lethargic and and appears drunk or superest generally as far as toxicity goes I would say marijuana is a pretty safe one the vet says edible pot can keep a dog high for several days and it doesn't take much even just eating the wrapper is enough luckily marijuana won't kill a dog unless it's a gigantic amount rich in THC like the butter used to make those edibles", "_sy2h-LBZqY": "hey my name is Messiah Rhodes growing up the only kind of drug people was cooking around me was crack this is bad for you but now weed is getting cooking into things is there such a thing there's too much

Dalton desserts and this is my second time on the view he can show yes you guys most seen Katerina in our last clap which is like two a year ago a year ago that was like Christmas last year's and we made some epic cake I was gonna say like it was like a bundt cake is it chocolate ginger molasses bundt cakes a lot it was good good tell them what you do what what's your computed by it why am I wearing this pink polka dot as well I am the chief dessert designer and founder of dolled up desserts we were a gluten-free and vegan bakery and baking mix company from Hamilton Ontario which is where Lisa is gonna be I'm very excited about that yeah I know stress I'm very stressed but it's gonna be getting but you know it's gonna have that stress can of cookies uh-huh oh yeah absolutely but before we get into it you definitely need to check out caps channel because you guys love whenever I break down the science of cookies or baking or cooking or anything like that and if you like that kind of thing you're gonna love her channel because she is way more knowledgeable than I am when it comes to cocoa science Kat has helped me today tweak my recipe and to making it cannabutter friendly because we explained this in her video the way that cannabutter for making it vegan is a little bit more difficult because we don't use vegan butter because like when you melt down vegan butter it acts a little weird when it comes to making cookies so we're using coconut oil we're not breaking down how to make Hannah butter in this video if you want that video go check out Kats channel I wanna get in the corner as well as down below she breaks down the legality of it all the disclaimers speaking of which hold on weed is not legal in every single place in Canada right now currently legal for people who are over 19 if you're in the States not every single state has legalized weed so please follow your local laws please do not take our word as the expert opinion and all-knowing we're here to help you have a safe and fun time using these products in food but again we are not the viola and all know-it-alls of the sitar not physicians no we are not responsible for anything that you do mm-hmm I and this is to be done in the comfort of your own home without children have a friend or two over because it's always exactly it's more fun to enjoy the effects of edibles with friends and also if you were ever enjoying weed or alcohol or any substance out there do not drive afterwards I don't leave operate any heavy machinery afterwards don't do anything where you need to be fully alert or fully functional like baking I do not recommend it the other thing too is that technically in Canada right now the consumption growth and production of marijuana is legal but not the production into edibles it will be legal in October of 2019 which we're super excited for it deltap desserts because we plan on getting a license and doing absolutely they're gonna be great this is for your own personal consumption not for resale and not for quality controls sake something that you want to be you know putting your name on and getting to lots of people when it comes to weed we talked about this as well on cats and video but I recommend getting it legally just you know to cover your bases I personally am a rule follower I'm not very good at bending the rules I feel very uncomfortable I have a lot of friends who are lawyers and police officers you know just follow the rules just sounds be legal think so I bought this on OCS which is the ontario canada store it was actually very easy the packaging that they send me was very discreet so I didn't have to like worry about like oh my god I'm gonna have weed so we're good so I bought the tangerine dream it has 14 point three six percent THC it's not gonna be exact on the website they give you a range I think when I bought this it was like between 12 to 22 percent and I was like I hope I do because I don't get that it's a plant though you can't kind of percent guarantee that's gonna grow right more information on my experience with buying from OCS podcast channel and again more information on weed in general and how it works in all this on kes channel but today we're just gonna make some cookies okay so the first thing that is important for cookies is fat because fat equals moisture and tenderness and cookies and also distributes flavor and for us it also just tributes again yeah so I've broken down the fat to coconut oil and Earth Balance IRA for cooking cookies with Earth Balance because I just like the texture I like the flavor adds kind of that buttery goodness to it I have all the ingredients weighed down below typically I give you guys recipes in volume so that's like in cups this whole recipe is measured in weight because we need to be really specific about how much THC is in each cookie and the best way to do that for the most consistent cookie is to weigh your ingredients I'll leave a link down for these scale that I use it's a really cheap scale honestly now that I've been baking this recipe up chess in this couple times with a scale mic why have I not been baking I mean by measurement by week before this is like so much easier other than that it's your typical stuff we have flax egg which is ground flax meal with water mixed together to absorb the liquid as it makes the moisture will and that pre out which will make the flax and cling to the stuff which binds which is what would do in the non-vegan cookie baking soda baking powder puffing spreading sugar sweetness structure and lecithin yes please please tell us about this is the other special ingredient that is used in cannabis cookies other than the special ingredient is some o soy or some Farah like this and a lot of people will cringe at that word especially in the vegan community to people who are very health conscious because lecithin is an additive it is not actually the worst additive in the world it's very important and actually in vegan baking I've been finding more and more it's essential to mimicking the effect of egg when it comes to dispersing fats and liquids evenly throughout a baked goods it's a particle that can hold on to both water and fat okay it's an emulsifier this is emulsifier this is a co2 this those particles will grab onto the fat in the weed and all the liquid that's coming from everything else they'll bind it and it will spread it out evenly and this is essential in any sort of edible whatsoever because you want that weed to be spread evenly if it is too much in one cookie and not another you could have really different experiences and that could be really dangerous some bad times toilets in you can buy both barn they have granules there I will give Lisa the conversions for it so if you are purchasing granulated lesson how to use it in this product you can also buy sunflower lesson as a tincture at most of your health food store so you can definitely buy it on Amazon at least it will link that and you can also buy it in a capsule format sunflower office since what we're using here today we're going to actually blend these two first with the sugar yeah and that is to ensure that the butter is aerated and we're gonna get a really nice and consistently sweet and fluffy and buttery cookie [Music] [Music] so make sure that you don't over mix these because I'm baking with gluten kat typically doesn't make the gluten so over mixing isn't two things would be pretty quickly it is a thing so you don't want to over mix your fees otherwise are gonna be really tough you can over mix this stuff before you put the flour in in fact I would highly recommend that you beat your fats and sugars and sunflower lecithin forever not first but like at least for five minutes and five to ten minutes until it's light white and fluffy because then you know for sure everything has been mixed really well don't go to ham on it because it will heat up and it will yeah that's best true because it has to be good yeah so like there is there is five minutes this is usually the rule of thumb for whether using butter or not lose them so we're gonna scoop on these cookies I have a two one one and a half yeah one and a half tablespoon scoop one 1/2 tablespoon scoop for cookies that's how I know that we measured this out properly if you really want to be meticulous about this you can weigh them on the scale which is what we do at the bakery but for your own home purposes it'll be fine a big tip pull your dough across the edge of the bowl so it's nice and flat give them about an inch and a half in between oh yes [Music] so we put the cookies in the freezer and then we're gonna bake for about eight minutes until they're puffy and golden I like to always under bake my cookies because it just means it's chewy and more delicious so I'll leave the exact timing and the measurement like the oven temperature temperature that's the work believ the Tucker's and the time I haven't had any cookies yet but apparently I'm already affected we're going to freeze a lot of this batter because that's how we keep this for later because this is a lot of these you can bake them all and then freeze them or you can freeze the dough and bake it on demand one more thing we're gonna do we're gonna add a little bit sea salt oh yes we are it makes it a good time yeah no sea salt adds a little deliciousness we're gonna bake those cookies and we'll see you after they're baked whoo alright and now they're baked they smell good they're cooled they have perfect carmelization on top or on bottom they have some nice little browning on top and actually didn't film this part but I did add a little bit of fleur de sel cuz it just adds a little extra some some you know when I'm gonna salt just like balances the sweetness so these are dosed at 0.01 grams grams which is 10 milligrams which is the legal dosing if you find this is not enough you can always have a second or you can just make more infused cannabutter mm-hmm I like more potent kinder this is probably about the equivalent of a drink yep so one drink equals one cookie exactly so it's about your tolerance try one cookie first you know if you are trying this out again nineteen plus and or according to whatever your law is wherever you are so I'm gonna give it a taste test cat cannot because she's driving yeah I'm gonna drive back to Hamilton I'm being good smells so good it smells very slightly like guns a little bit but it's nice it's not like overpowering it kind of almost adds a depth of flavor and my no smell like I'm gonna go do it well that sounded great that's not like crispy on the outside soft on the inside mm-hmm please tell me what it tastes like I wanna know so it's like Christmas I actually over make these a little bit I would actually under break them even more it was because we forgot the salt so I pulled them out put them then and then I restarted the timer so I probably baked it an extra minute too long crispy on the outside chewy on the inside hella hella good lots of sweetness I'm using mini chocolate chips in this one I actually prefer it that's like my favorite yeah cuz I like the ratio of cookie to chocolate in that area like dispersion we did chocolate chunks last time and they were good but I think for a more consistent cookie you think chips is a lot better for the description of the marijuana as well yeah and the salt is just it's a good time there's just so many different layers and then just like a hint just like I'm not I'm the I'm a back of

[Music] take a paper cut [Music] something to do stew - just transferred a 1000 [Music] [Music]", "T1tj62nRWf4": "waters up everybody and welcome back to another product review for today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining much love please smash that like button show that support and hey if you'd like to see more content just like this thing consider subscribing

to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please

Cali foods in San Francisco food because the food over there is a lot better than over here in Arizona and you know I made a mistake I ate a chocolate I thought it was regularly dagesh megator

have read what it was what brand it was or anything but you know how you sit down you eat something you read the wrapper you read the ingredients you read small print so I sat down finish that chocolate top the chocolate more than half of the chocolate and then I read at the top small print 100 milligrams of cannabis and I said oh sure like I didn't think it would affect me because I didn't think anything of it like literally I forgot even took it and whatever I continued the rest of my night yeah anyways so it literally took an hour and a half for it to hit me I was we went to in and out I remember my friend was talking to me and we just ordered so my friend was telling me something and literally I was just staring and I literally forgot whatever they said and I was like wait what and they told me again and I felt like I was like staring like I was staring but I wasn't like I couldn't listen I couldn't focus and I was like oh shoot and literally dazed off I looked out into the sheet and I saw the cars like moving so slowly everything felt so slow and like I felt like it was just spinning I turned around off oh my gosh I started freaking it was like the most trapeze feeling in the world I was panicking I was like oh my god I don't know I couldn't control what I was doing I have anxiety I have panic attacks I can't panic attacks a lot so imagine being panic attack Plus on a panic having an attack from what I ate so I think we pulled up and I was like yo I need to throw up I remember running to the bathroom trying to make myself throw up I don't like this feeling I was just throwing up and throwing up and I didn't have anything in my system the high ghoul you need to eat and I was like I could I couldn't eat like everything to me tasted so disgusting and I just remember we ended up back at the hotel and my friend she kept saying yo like here takes take some of the shake take take a bite and I could in like it just disgusted me I just kept pacing back and forth back and forth I canna do I want to go home take me to the hospital I was tripping I was tripping bad when I'm telling you I was tripping bad nobody could calm me down I was just walking up scared oh my gosh I felt probably I was probably being annoying on this leave but I I just I didn't know what to do I do I'm not used to weed edibles and I heard edibles mess you up more so my friends like what do you want like come come sit on the couch watch movie so she put on a movie and I just kept getting how they do it I can't be sitting on one spot like I just kept thinking so much stuff say all right go for a walk I went for a walk I felt like I went for like the longest well I felt like I was walking for two hours I remember coming back to the hotel and it was only 13 15 minutes I was sweating from the walk that I thought I took four hours and then she's I do just lay down just calm down and I said all right so I would lay down to the lights off but I just kept hearing noise and if I heard a noise I would just focus on that one noise and then imma go you know what I can't see if I can't sleep I kept throwing up should I do it eat eat eat and I couldn't and they just suck my Chi I couldn't I don't know I don't know how to explain the feeling like everything was going so slow I felt like my mouth was like I couldn't feel like maybe I was like slapping myself and I couldn't feel the slap I pinched myself I can't feel anything and it made me so depressed like I seriously started crying as I remember crying and then literally it was just a routine lay down get up go I would go out of the room come back in the room throw up and then I'll say whatever I just started drinking a lot a lot of water cuz I think I'll just flush it out of my system nothing nothing and it was already like two three hours later and I dude it's not going away I want to go home she's like dude we can't waste our Cisco and I was hitting up my cut like I was like I wanna stand in my cousin's house I was just scared I didn't hear anybody up the whole night and I remember sending my location to every person I knew cuz you're gonna go out of state make sure you let everybody know where you have this in case you never know you never know and then finally I think I'm gonna insert you know here's an insert clip you can't really hear cause she had music but [Music] I know I look lost lost and scared but I finally fell asleep I remember I laid down I put Christian music on I fell a little piece I ate this edible at 12 or 11:30 and I didn't sleep until 5:00 5:30 in the morning I woke up two hours later we went out to the store and I was like you know what I feel better we went out to the store and thirty minutes into walking around I felt dizzy again and I was like bro like I feel I felt like I did yesterday she's like no you're just overthinking it and I was again she's probably right nope I don't remember coming back to the hotel I remember getting it at the hotel I don't remember how I got to the hotel but we got to the hotel we made breakfast and then I felt good again and then we made Charlie cook home well we made pancakes I forgot what else with me and I only took two bites of the egg and I think I had some strawberries but I just I didn't have an appetite I remember dazing off and then I went to go lay down cuz I was like maybe I just need to sleep it off I still feel it but no one believed me I was like bro I feel like she's like knowledge just your head that's okay I remember I got ready I felt I think I fell asleep oh man I just remembered hopping on it uber and then we went to this one place it was like I think in San Jose I don't know it was called and we would not to eat and I was good like I'll say all right it's fresh air cuz it was really fresh at that time and we were eating and then I felt dizzy again she's like dude why you keep white why are you dazing off I don't know I was like I still I feel dizzy she's like dude just stop thinking about it how the [ __ ] this one was supposed to stop thinking about something when you feel something I know what I felt and I know what I was feeling I know nothing crazy I remember just everything going so slow like the food service is going slow the conversation I don't remember the conversations I had it was just like it was just a blur like I literally felt like I didn't even go to San Francisco I didn't even go out of state because I felt like everything to me was a blur it still is a blur I don't know I've never been blacked out drunk but I literally felt like if I would have got really drunk passed out and be like hey what happened and then I and I had mood swings like I kept getting mad I kept getting sad I kept getting happy and then we got back to the hotel an hour later and then I tried sleeping it off the next morning I felt okay I felt good we went to the we went out to eat again and as soon as the food arrives ice tastes off again and I was like I didn't even I didn't even tell my friend anything at this point because then she was gonna be like it's just your imagination and then I remember getting to the airport and she was looking for a book and I just started feeling dizzy again I was like I'm either really tired or it's still in my system and I don't know what the heck is going on with me fell asleep waiting for the airplane on answer exactly right now and then we got on the airplane and I fell asleep because you know what I just want to sleep it off I don't even want to feel this no more I was like by the time I get back home in Phoenix it's gonna be good I got off felt good for like two hours I just started flipping out I loved it was because of the airplane the way it went up down I don't know I was just tripping out like you know what I'm gonna go for a run ayran I ran well in my imagination I don't even know cuz what around the park I ran all the way to the next street I ran back and then I was like oh good now for like five minutes and I was like like I still felt so panicked and I didn't want to say anything I don't want to tell my mom cuz I was like she probably thought I took this on perfect I did not take this on purpose you guys and finally I was like the next day I was like alright I'm sleeping up I couldn't even sleep that night I woke up and now whole day I felt dizzy and I remember just being like I take me to the hospital like I can't eat I can't drink everything I eat I throw up and then we went to the hospital I told the lady what happened I I told my mom what happened I thought my mom was gonna be mad I was like why I want you to think this with me and the lady told me you know what you didn't eat the whole day your body's not used to it and your system everybody system is different so they literally had to put an IV in me I think that was ID I don't know she said she was hydrating me because of everything that I was throwing up that couldn't eat I couldn't drink and I was in the hospital for like a good minute and then the whole week like it was the worst week of my life I am NOT a weak [ __ ] but then it takes a lot for me to go to the hospital because you know I passed out and I was like that's the only reason was because I've never passed out in my life and I did and I was like something's wrong with my body that's why I went in there and the whole week all I could drink with liquids I drink it was sweat Oh everyone it's called in English I drink water my mom kept making food but I couldn't eat it because I have an appetite I was sleeping for hours I didn't want to stand up because I felt like I'd fall back down I didn't talk to anybody I didn't reply to anybody I didn't want to deal with anybody I felt like it did put me in a depression because I've never felt like that and I just be crying crying looks like I'm gonna stay like this all my life and I just I'm gonna over think of you guys so it was up until Friday where my mom said you know what you need to go outside you need to go walk you need to eat something because it's not gonna go away if you don't eat okay when walked around Walmart I felt dizzy I need to go back in the car not didn't come back out after that the next day like it was going away I had to be wearing my glasses because I felt like that's all he's gonna help me focus I didn't want to wear them too much because I don't want my eyes to adjust wearing them all day and I only wear them for like reading or driving and then finally it was until Sunday were actually like I felt good I went out to eat I ate the first meal I had in the whole week and I love food so that week I dropped I literally dropped 10 pounds a whole week because it was just like nothing but butt naked juices and water oh and a medicine sweat oh and then like ashes [ __ ] you guys I I guess everybody has a story of like when it's the first time it's a trip but the fact that I tripped out for a whole week and weekend like that tripped me out and even the doctor was like you know it's still in your system Erik I'm saying though it's not your system it was still in my system like it was still processing it the fact that I didn't eat the

It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box.

So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000?

This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here.

welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested in supporting off of youtube make sure you check out our patreon page it's going to be linked in the description you get a lot of things for your pledges every month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this video helpful before we get up out of here i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight today's subscriber spotlight goes out

back again with another edible review this time I picked up something called punch bar never heard of this it look pretty good so I just picked it up it was $18 pretty pricey 225 milligrams of cannabis in it it's a chocolate so again it's going to be pretty potent and as the name suggests as well so I have Adam here sorry about the steady we're just on our way to the [ __ ] City Walk and I thought it'd be a great time to do a review so I'm only going to about 1/4 this is packaging ended pretty nice graphic design on there I'm open it this is the inside right here like without jeans pretty nice and a times divided so into 90 little pieces each piece has 25 milligram of cannabis in it Oh am I amita for it that's about I'm family guy ah so that's 35 milligrams right there then we'll be eating Adam is only if any and five milligrams as well so we're going to split this or we might have to do have to have one footed so this is what it looks like on the inside it's the divided into nine pieces 25 milligrams each piece it looks three nice and it has the graphic on the chocolate smells like chocolate no weed so we'll see what the taste is like and we'll tune back in and in about 30 minutes 45 minutes or whenever we hit the free night shelters by the way so here's the chocolate again we divide it into three pieces already I'm late one of these three pieces so let me be ingesting 75 milligrams it takes a lot like we so everyone like edibles that is like weed this wouldn't be the right edible for you like I said before you shouldn't be eating edibles if you don't like to take the weeds but yeah this tastes a lot like we listen in and like 30 to 45 minutes we'll be back see you guys later thank you so YouTube so I'm chillin as you can see I'm pretty stable the facts I would rate them like a 10 nah not it's not even 10 for the monitor well maybe a 10 yeah the time is it got me pretty good more like it was 50 wise very potent as you can see am i dead give away the fruits on here my boy Adam a chair sitting so I would recommend this like a 10 for beginners like a little square would be good maybe even half of that square for beginners intermediate it's like a square and a half and expert like Adams already would realize maybe six of the square is maybe pretty expensive in my opinion $18.00 but it will give you three doses 81 and okay hi so I rate this instead based on the amounts I ate not on not on us too high I experienced the pretty potent hires I'm saying for the mountain ight so I'm a pretty guy 135 pounds by 5 so 5 5 so pretty yeah just not dropped in the comments below which you want me to review next any edibles anything you want to read in a dropper in the comments below and I'll be glad to his real as soon as I can subscribe like my channel and I'll be back soon", "KOtZ3v8t3s8": "plus five and everybody boys I hope my neighbors are at home but I'm sure that they are boy we finally get late in today's video I feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big

potassium sodium tartrate into not wine but weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "e_755m6T93I": "I real quick guys I just want to let you know this video is for educational and informational purposes only my goal is to educate people about drugs and what it's like to use them without ever having to try it themselves do not try anything mentioned in this video by viewing this video you agree to this disclaimer and to not attempt to recreate any of the things found in my content alright guys so today I'm coming in with a [ __ ] bang alright it's gonna be a funny a story about the time me and my friend Ryan ate edibles and totally [ __ ] ourselves up like too much edibles alright this story starts off with me at my house after Thanksgiving I get a call from my friend Anthony right and he goes amen he's like eh you trying to see a movie tonight I like 8:30 and we had my family over so I was like I don't know man I don't know if I can do it right so my family left kind of early around 7:00 and he said he wanted to see the movie at 8:00 so I asked my mom she was alright with that she said alright you can go as long as you got a ride there ride back you know I told them I said yeah I said I can go to the movie so it was me my friend and my friend Anthony and then I asked my friend Ryan to go to when I called my friend Ryan he told me he said a man he's like I got some [ __ ] and I was like what you got a man and he's like I got 500 milligrams of THC edibles I was like all right [ __ ] bet I have the court right I have court I have a court case going on I'm not gonna get to in a detail about it because that's for another story and he goes all right he's like you got core next week he's like you should be fine if you eat a little bit of edible sin I just make sure you drink a lot of water green tea stuff like that you know to clean cleanse out my system so I don't fail drug tests or anything so I'm like alright dude I'm down let's do them well here we go we got a edibles dosing chart here so I know for a fact and I'm not talking [ __ ] it says um first time consumers and for micro dosers you take one to two point five milligrams of THC that's not [ __ ] at all right and it was a 50 milligram dose at a time so it said only it said 50 milligram dose each yummy we had gummies so it's 500 so it was ten of them ten gummies right and my friend I don't know why he smokes so much and we both smoked a lot honestly we have a high tolerance so he's like all right he's like last time I had 100 milligrams and I was feeling a little bit of something you know so he ate two gummies and I figured since I have a tolerance - he's bigger than me by the way right so obviously he needs eat a little bit more so I said all right I think I'll go for a hundred - so while we're at this movie theater I eat two gummy so we're sitting in the lobby I eat - go means keep in mind edibles take a while if you eat food before right if you have like a full stomach it's gonna take it could take up to two hours that says depending on your digestive system so I figured it would hit in probably like an hour an hour and a half cuz I ate a lot of food and Thanksgiving right and so did my friends so it would it was gonna take a while it would hit during the movie well my friend Anthony breaks the [ __ ] news and he tells us that he did not order the [ __ ] tickets and we're just gonna go in for free so we go there and we're sitting here just not knowing what the [ __ ] to do cuz we're looking online there's no seats empty whatsoever on these movies and I'm surprising because it's Thanksgiving you know like people would be out well guess what there's like no [ __ ] seats next to each other we need three next to each other we were gonna sit next to each other no seats open whatsoever so when we walk in here there's nowhere to sit so we just walked out and we're being real sketchy I feel like the workers knew we were gonna sneak into the movie so I was like dude let's just get the [ __ ] out of here cuz I don't know I want to get in trouble I don't want the cops called or nothing and he's like alright we'll go to Target right on run away don't think these are gonna hit that hard and I was like we should just go I have enough money to buy another bag right $30 he had fifty I had 15 he had 15 so we were gonna buy a bag and split so we hit up the plug and we're kind of just strolling around and Best Buy we bought a Bluetooth speaker it was Black Friday so the lines are long as [ __ ] you know we're just walking around this Plaza waiting for the plug to pull up so the plug pulls up we see him and we're like oh it's been an hour at this point so I'm like yeah I'm not feeling anything and I feel like we're gonna need more we see the plug more like alright there's a lot of people around we're not trying to do this in public so pull into this Taco Bell parking lot over here and we'll go meet you over there we [ __ ] Usain Bolt running all the way to this Taco Bell and he's already sitting there chilling in his car we pull up more like hey man how you doing you know the classic [ __ ] plug talk you know I'm saying and we get our bag right we leave and we go to Target and I'm like are a dude like keep in mind I did not know how much edibles to eat so I was like dude I'll just eat two more okay so at this point I got [ __ ] 200 mils down down the [ __ ] drain 200 mils down the drain I look probably a mile or two away from the movie theater so I was like yeah we can just we can go to my house kick it and we'll just have a nice walk and hopefully it kicks in by them right I was like we're gonna go walk to my house we start walking and my [ __ ] - idiot friends just jaywalked ran across the [ __ ] street and ditched me I was like you know what I'll just walk the other way there's two ways we could have gone to my house I went the other way they went that separate way so at this point I'm walking by myself through the [ __ ] woods scariest [ __ ] and at this point I kind of started feeling a little bit of something I was like it was probably two hours after I felt a little bit of something and I was like man I ate a lot like I don't know why I'm not tripping right now and I just started seeing like I look up and I just see all the trees in the night sky and I was just like looking at it you know and there's coyotes in my neighborhood by the way so I was [ __ ] hot I was scared like I was just overthinking I was like am I gonna get bit by a [ __ ] coyote or something like I was scared right so eventually I get to my house they're already there and we go into my room and we got this fat ass bag of edibles sitting on the [ __ ] table and we waited a while because we already ate them so we're like alright we'll just wait till the [ __ ] sets in no no and hour and a half later after waiting we still do not feel too much and my friends like you know what if ice pellets just all spend the night here and let's just eat this whole [ __ ] bag and I was like you know what I was like I'm not feeling nothing and I'm gonna [ __ ] eat it right and I [ __ ] was I was totally under estimating this [ __ ] because I ate so much food before this like I should have totally [ __ ] just waited that guy was being we're all being impatient we wanted to be high you know and we're are we're like okay so we eat these edibles at this point I have 400 milligrams down the [ __ ] drain oh no I think it was 350 or 300 I don't know around that range 300 or 400 milligrams I had down the drain in my friend ate a whole [ __ ] bag 500 milligrams 500 and we're just sitting here well er eh we're definitely about to trade soon since we ate so much edibles this time in 30 minutes I was already feeling [ __ ] [ __ ] off like I was laughing I was just so my heart was just racing like it was scary you know like I was actually kind of scared because it's been my first time and I ate 500 [ __ ] like I ate 350 milligrams around there and I'm just it's my first time you're supposed to [ __ ] only I'm like thirty I was only supposed to eat one of them one are you [ __ ] six of them and I'm [ __ ] sitting here tripping sack and my friends are good I'm not feeling anything I'm like dude you [ __ ] ate enough to put a bear down like that [ __ ] ate enough edibles to put a [ __ ] bear to sleep like he and he's just like I'm not feeling anything dude I'm not human or anything he waits an hour and we're both just [ __ ] plaster dude it was just not even funny and then at that point I was just I was just tripping like I was everything was just so funny to me you know like I started seeing I started like seeing a little bit of [ __ ] and like people say that if you eat a lot of edibles it can be like a mild room trip I started seeing [ __ ] like I started it was just weird like my room just looked different and it was like everything just looked different to me you know and it was a it was definitely experienced but I feel like the edibles were just I don't know what was wrong with them I don't know why they didn't kick in I don't know if it was mine that we ate before but yeah by the end of the night we were all [ __ ] up and I eventually just passed the [ __ ] out like I did not remember that night like that's why I can't tell you too much cuz I don't remember like I don't [ __ ] remember we ate so much we just blacked out that night I remember seeing I remember the beginning of the trip where I just started seeing a little bit of [ __ ] you know really giggly laughy and yeah that's about it and my friend told me that I was out like a [ __ ] light in like 30 minutes I they could not wake me up like they tried to wake me up and I just would not wake up they were scared and yeah we all [ __ ] blacked out by the end of the night woke up the next day feeling really [ __ ] weird like feeling like we were drunk as [ __ ] like hungover kind of and yes so that's the story about my first time eating edibles hope you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like on the video make sure to comment down below so I know if you guys liked the video or not and I'll see you guys peace", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "l5nnEK_g7E8": "she thought i was there that in my head i was thinking oh my god she thinks i'm deaf i was not in the correct

everything's quite good the next thing you know we're giggling to each other we're all laughing at stuff that's not funny you know you're just laughing for no reason like that's was happening and i was like yo i start well you know when you clock that you're tripping like i said to her like yo ela we're like we're gone we're gonna she's like oh my god we are good right so that was the first stage station number one laughing just giggling too much right then time passed again and we were just like we were just lying like talking to each other and everything was too funny it was so funny that you couldn't breathe you know like when you're just losing the oxygen you can't oxygenate yourself yeah you can't oxygenize yourself and you just can't breathe because you're laughing too much and see my friend has asthma so she was like yo why wait i [Music] she was like yo when is this going to start when is it going to wear off because she was getting a little bit worried because she was giggling and like she low-key couldn't breathe and i was like no but she she tried to blame me she was like it's because you're talking that's why i'm laughing so much and i'm like i'm not even saying nothing crazy i'm just i'm just talking to you you're laughing right so she was like yo when this is gonna wear off and she was getting a bit worried now this is the part where i realized i was tripping out i was tripping this is stage two tripping start seeing things that you keep that you never did see before yeah so i told her this like after it happened and she was like oh that is crazy so here's what happened so we're lying face to face to each like looking at each other like talking right and we weren't laughing we weren't speaking we weren't laughing we just was just looking at each other right the way that she was looking at me was like oh my days you know that look in your face like oh my dave it's like that worried look she was looking at me like right like and i was looking at her like that you know like deadpan like like i saw death i'm telling you this right now i did i did see death okay you know the guy you know the guy here's the guy right here this is death okay i saw this story right here deaf right and i was like family i don't know what's going on but it needs to under one that i mean me and english don't run so don't watch mine because she was looking at me like and i wasn't like like like okay because like i feel in my head she thought i was deaf i didn't know that i didn't think she was there in my head she thought i was deaf that in my head i was thinking oh my god she thinks i'm dead this guy i'm going to keep putting up so you know this guy right here she thought i was that dumb okay and here's why i know she thought that because we were there we were lying and i was staring at her just you know when you're like staring into somebody's soul that's how i was staring at her right and she says to me what are you looking at that's how the convo went right so she when she asked me oh how long is this going to take to wear off okay but she sounded really worried like like this was the end of the world how long is it going to take to wear a flight seriously like that's how she was moving not not that frantically but that's how she was moving right and i was like all you have to do i said it so calmly that's why i knew she knew that i was deaf okay dead right here man i was like all you have to do is close your eyes and go to sleep now what kind of psych who who else would say that but that him right here that's the only person i will say that okay our man said i said we have to do is close your eyes and go to sleep just sleep it off and you'll wake up fine because that's actually what you're supposed to do you're supposed to sleep like if you feel like oh i can't do it just sleep off and when you wake up good calm obviously it sounded sketchy in the moment because it was all that i mean so she was like okay now here's when i knew that death was coming for me now yeah remember that though here's how i knew he was coming for me my phone rang and um i don't remember if it was an unknown cooler i think it was an unknown caller i don't know who was calling me new years okay eve but somebody was calling me unknown and when i answered the phone i recognized who it was but in that moment i was like oh my god he's calling me to take me away like this done he's calling me to take me away so i hunt the phone i was like nope i'm not nope i'm not i should have very good no and i was there and i was unless she i laid down like this i was shivering jeff just called me just now like to take you away bro what am i gonna do and the phone rang again and i declined the call and i'm like no no and i put my phone on side so i wouldn't hear it again because i swear on every time my phone rang my heart ejected out of my body came back whole new heart the second part of the hallucination now so basically i think i fell asleep at this point i'm i don't know don't do it guys okay i like the knowledge i like to remember the days that i've lived okay but anyway um after after you know i thought death was calling i finally fell asleep all right and this was about apparently according to my friend this was like 20 i was sleeping for like 20 minutes or even 30. it wasn't long and in that time i was sleeping and it must have been a dream such hallucination because this is what happened right so basically i came to the conclusion that i was not in the correct dimension don't ask me questions man don't ask me questions man i came to the conclusion that i was not in the correct dimension if i could find a picture of a dimension or even a definition of a dimension i'll put it right there if not google it babe anyway i thought i was in the wrong dimension and basically the people in my head or my dream they were trying to let me know oh like like the real world right now i'm not supposed to be in it this is a fake it's fake it's not real i'm supposed to be in this one and they're showing me around it kind of looks like um what you would think mars looks like so it's kind of like reddish purpley like sand and rock it just looks like you're in space kind of and you're walking around it's just it's just a big opening that's what i saw and the dons in the dream was like yeah like you've been in that world for too long you're not supposed to be there for that long like you need to come back home little did i know that he was trying to trick me so basically so basically they were trying to convince me that the real world is not real it's fake and that i'm not supposed to be in that dimension and i'm supposed to live my life in the the dimension with the sand and the rock and the red yeah that's what they were trying to convince me but in reality they were trying to suck me in they were trying to trap me there so that i could stay there because that's actually the fake world and they want me to stay in that fake world that's what they were trying to do they were trying to trap me in the fake world trying to tell me that my world's not real but really and truly their world is not real and they were trying to trap me in that dimension so i was getting worried like oh my god it's going to be like a couple years until i get back into the other dimension which is my own dimension i don't know man i don't ask me too many questions because it's all not so crazy because i was not that conscious at this part that i'm about to tell you it's not really the worst part for me because i wasn't really conscious i wasn't really awake but i was half awake and i was half somewhere else okay so basically the next part before i even tell you this i want a declaration i want to let my best friend you know you are my best friend i want to let her know that i'm so sorry and i didn't mean okay don't let me cry i didn't mean to ruin your house like that okay i didn't mean to ruin your house like that i didn't mean to ruin your new years like that to all the family that was in that yo okay i didn't mean it okay okay so here's what happened um so after i had that hallucination they're trying to trap me into their world i wake up and i sit up i was lying on myself you know when you have like a deep breath like you're about to burp like throw up it was one of those ones so i was like okay deep breath oh it's just a burp it was not it wasn't a burp but you know i ran i was not i didn't make it i was too late i ran literally so like like the the room that i was in the the toilet is like it's not far okay but like by the time i got to the toilet i just didn't make it man i just make i made it this much i would have made it but yeah form it on the floor in the toilet in the sink in the sink you know e yeah and according to the people present i was it just it's like i was a bit conscious i don't think i was conscious though at the same time like i said i wasn't awake like but i i don't know how to explain it but i was there i was there but i wasn't like i remember things happening and i'm like well i don't know i don't know if that really happened i'd have to ask someone you know i asked people and i was like oh [ __ ] i remember that what did that happen uh i remember things you know but i don't remember anyway waffling now yeah so a lot of projectiles okay a lot of projectiles all the kebab in the toilet anything on floor my best friend had to clean the carpet and i told you again i'm so sorry babe i'm so sorry okay but you know what carpet is sparkling now so really i did your favorite really are they doing okay more of the story is guys yeah don't do it on top of finales okay it's not good for you it's not safe especially if you like if you're doing it with somebody that hasn't done it before you know how they say uh you can't go to your friends for advice because they're the same age as you you have to go to somebody one stage up you know or a couple more stages up yeah so you need to deal with somebody that has done it before so they can be like this is what you need to do so you this does not happen to you man so in future i would just not do it or i would eat less if someone told me you're supposed to eat it slowly i feel that's what it was because i had the whole thing it was a small brownie and i ate the whole thing maybe that's what it was okay or maybe it's because i ate it right after i ate food maybe maybe i was drinking that day too maybe it was that i don't know all i know is mad crazy um but you know what you know what i did get got a nice detox yeah everything out there yeah i feel clean you know from that they oh yeah i feel clean okay um yeah so that was my lovely beautiful experience um having the edibles man fortman was in a whole new dimension okay and yeah sometimes when i'm just like sitting on the bus or just i'm just chilling i'm just thinking to myself sometimes i think to myself what if that other dimension is the real dimension i'm in the wrong one what if i'm actually in the wrong one and they were actually telling me the truth yeah sometimes i think about that and then i realized to myself i don't even know i just i'm just thinking about i'm just like sometimes i think it's like yeah yeah i feel like yeah they was trying to help me out and i didn't believe them you
