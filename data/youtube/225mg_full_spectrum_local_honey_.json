{"G2c3FOgaWPc": "yeah i really do like raw honey where the bees are never fed sugar and that's that innovation is coming from here you'd be surprised at how many good quality honeys that we buy say raw unfiltered local however the bees are fed sugar for maybe three to four months of out of the year and they're corrupted by sugar or corn syrup even sometimes molasses brown sugar and that caused a catastrophe back and it was a 60s 70s with the botulism which came from the brown sugar and whether that was what caused the children to be sick we don't know a little bit but it led to a whole change in the world mentality so that at least in the western world our infants were denied a tremendous medicine which is the raw honey now if let's just have raw honey for our infants if they need to or children from bees certified not to have eaten sugar or corn syrup or brown sugar uh again the rat droppings were in those uh that sugar and then that got locked into the honey and so they measured that and thought the honey was the problem with these cases of botulism but not they didn't do enough research if you take the historical use of raw unfiltered honey with bees fed their own food there are no cases of botulism and we're talking about a hundred thousand years of human i don't know how many years uh so so let's get the facts straight and that's what this channel is all about so so i've been giving this for now 30 years to infants and if they need it if they have diarrhea if they have sickness or they have stomach colic it's tremendous now also you should know that there is the article by the journal of pediatrics where they infused honey probably wasn't even raw in in the veins of infants with severe diarrhea and and challenged it to pedialyte and the honey worked better also and that's the journal of pediatrics well why are we banning this don't ban it for the little ones that need it uh it's and it's nourishing it's pre-digested it's easy for them to tolerate secondly another study found that this type of honey or even just local honey was more effective for coughs than the typical codeine syrups which caused in about a decade ago several fatalities which led to changes in the drug laws for code and codeine based infant cough syrups and i won't give the names but the point is that what are we doing we're banning the best cough medicine for infants and children in the universe the best anti-diarrheal a godly made medicine that is watched by the almighty creator to make sure that it's uh and preordained to be good for the human kind and you find it in the bible in the quran of course the quran is very specific saying it's a medicine unto humankind and all the different colors and liquors and things that are a blessing but so this this is fun too this is a north american's own hives honey it uh it's a wildflower honey and a wild herbal honey they um they have some fun with this it just came out and it's got the label on it but this is delicious and i love this in the smoothies and in my you know nutrition drink in the morning on toast in tea maybe not super hot tea because the this is loaded with enzymes it's loaded with lactobacilli these are substances that are destroyed in human corruption issues like the feeding of sugar and corn syrup these are substances that we need that we need the catalase the peroxidase which is anti-tumor substance we need the formic acid which is easily destroyed by heat by by the way we need the hydrogen peroxide that's in here and this actually makes hydrogen peroxide as it goes through the system we need the the benefit of the lactobacilli for the gut health and that's lost when when we feed b sugar so i would take advantage of any of the different honeys that are clean and purified and full of the divine energy for your better health i just got a report that an individual had severe pain in his flank we don't know what was causing it and he tried a number of medicines and even in that internal pain it's like if you have digestive pain kidney pain back pain if it's internal and the organs are upset the honey is your best bet for diarrhea it's your best bet for chronic constipation it's a good laxative so take advantage of it for digestive problems for male digestion for h pylori many illnesses that respond to the honey prescription", "cTDFBZbIThE": "okay so it's funny harvest day this is our fourth year so we've learned a lot we continue to learn every day none of other colonies were very successful in terms of producing honey we got maybe five pounds from from what I have nicknamed are lazy hi this colony we're hoping that for the first time we get a hundred pounds out of a single colony but we'll have to see how that works I know one of these boxes was empty a few weeks ago so if one of those is empty I don't know that we'll have 100 pounds so I'm just gonna kind of inventory each of the boxes first and then start shaking the bees off so we can take them to harvest a lot of people ask why we don't use smoke when we go to high harvest honey we don't want smoke flavor honey so on honey harvest Day we typically don't use any smoke at all you can but we just prefer to avoid it and you know there's a lot of other ways where you can get the bees away from the boxes you know I've seen somebody use a leaf blower you have the bee filter things you can put on I just prefer Oh since we don't have that many colonies I just I just shake the bees off so let's let's inventory these four boxes see how much honey we have so just by way of commentary on this colony this was a swarm that we caught earlier this year we actually got this one 25 feet up in a tree which was the first time we had ever done that and I say we but I had nothing to do with it I was actually out of town and so I actually went and got it out of the tree by himself with the B vacuum and amazingly this has been our most prolific in terms of honey colony that we've had the one that is just to the right of the camera by two holy cow clearly anyway I was I was saying the colony that's two to the right as you're looking at it from this one that was the only colony we have that survived the winter and it also was a swarm that we got fairly late in the season last year and it really has not done a whole lot now to be fair we did end up robbing that one of some brood frames to try to have some of our other colonies that were queenless create Queens so we did sort of sabotage it a little that this one far exceeded that one in terms of honey production and without this one we would have very little honey for this season so we're very very grateful for this 25 we call it the 25 foot hive what's a purpose on this but I don't think there's any honey in that box they just didn't like this one I don't know why we tried it up high we tried it down low or you know that or just the honey flow was over so all right this one's heavy whoa that might be more than 30 pounds - so we're gonna be pretty close so we'll have to see so we'll turn it off a little bit we need to add some beetle traps to this get it close back up and then I'll shake a few frames do you want to show the beetle traps that we have yeah so we use the we use these more permanent ones so you put oil on the outside is it apple vinegar red wine vinegar red wine vinegar that's what attracts the beetles and so the beetles smell this and they walk down into here and they drown in the oil so the top of what it looks like so you have a can see there's holes for them to go down inside the one that has the oil but not the vinegar but we have not seen us is hardly a single hive beetle this year so I'm not even sure these are gonna trap any but the mistake we made last year it was a bad year we harvested honey and we didn't put our traps and as we harvested the honey and it was a disaster last year so good news is we're going in right now into the fall with five colonies so that's the most we've ever had so these just garden show so these just go down on the outside between the box and the first frame on we put four in the top not we don't put any in the bottom since we tend not to go down into the bottom to do much inspection we tend to just kind of let them be down there so we put four of them in the top and then each week or two weeks when we check them we look to see how many high beetles in there and if we need to refresh the oil because there's a lot of pie beetles in there then we'll just dump the oil out and oftentimes the vinegar can just be reused as long as it hasn't gone bad we'll just reuse the vinegar for a few weeks or even a month or so and then we'll clean them all out and redo them until it really gets to be cold enough where the high beetles don't really come anymore we're just a little paranoid because we lost two colonies last year two hive beetles so many last year there were so many and they leave a terrible smell in the hive and they leave this slimy film all over so between the slimy film and the smell the bees just hate them so we actually saw one of our colonies last year actually leave the whole hive all of them abscond from the hive because the hive beetles were so bad and so we're a little paranoid this year but the thing that we do have this year that we didn't last year is they are up on our deck so they are raised up as opposed to last year I don't know if you can see with the shadows but last year that's where we had our colonies and so high beetles need to lay eggs in the dirt so because they were right on the dirt last year they had plenty of room whereas now we're probably I don't know six or eight ten feet off the off the ground and so we're hoping that that might also help with the hive beetle so this is that's a fully capped frame of honey the white on the outside is the bees will put wax on the outside and that indicates that it is the right moisture content and it is ready to be used to a little bit a little bit open but for the most part that honey is just ready to go ready for us to steal and eat we call it liquid gold just shake off the few bees and it's bright enough it's ready to go yike all right so we are now over at our friends house who have a convenient honey house for us to borrow so we are now cutting off the wax coating that the bees put on to indicate that the honey is at the right moisture level and ready for consumption so you can see that he's just taking a little bit of the outside off this is a frame that we have used before so the bees have built it out just a little bit should it's a little bit thicker each min much and that makes it really easy to take the serrated knife and just slide off the wax caffeine's from the outside so we'll do both sides of this frame and the wax caffeine's just fall into this bucket it has a wire frame on the bottom so the honey will drip through and we will filter that and take the honey out of the wax cappings as well so once you have second-year super frames where the first year you put in ten and let the biggest build those out and then the next year you do nine and so they build them out a little thicker which makes cutting the wax from the outside so so much easier less less work to have to do the little what do you call that little tool a little mini scraper anyway so this is now ready to go into the extractor and we got a hot tip from someone somewhere along the road that when you're done taking off all the wax that before you put it in the extractor you flip it upside down because the honey I don't know if you could see on the video has started to kind of drain down a little bit so you flip it upside down to keep it from dripping all over the floor and then it goes inside I got my water bottle sorry for that loud noise goes inside the extractor and they have will have six frames in here at one time you can see the honey's whipping up there YUM don't you wish you could just like a little lick that read off they're so good anyway so we'll do one more we have five loaded in here now we'll load the sixth one in here and then so what it looks like neck spinning alright so we have our six frames loaded in here so we're going to go ahead and start the extractor when we do it pretty slowly at first especially where your frames are really full with honey because we learned the hard way and our Murph it was last year the year before we got it spinning a little too fast too quickly and what happened was it kind of made our some of our frames kind of fall apart so we've learned that we'll just do it a little slowly let the bulk of the weight of the honey flow out and then once the both of the honey flows out then you can spin it a little faster so that the residual kind of gets flowing out to the side so when you're doing this don't do what we did learn from our mistake so you can feel them you keep restarting bottom there and the fact that it was rocking a little bit means that we didn't do a very good job getting the same weight frames in each section so if you have six equally weighted frames then it tends not to rock your extractor if you have some that are lighter and honey than others and it's kind of like a washing machine it will just be out of balance and you'll get a lot more walking they'll keep letting that spin for a minute and then show you what the empty frames look like when it's been spun up [Music] open the gates and let it all flow out so this is going into a filter we should have lifted that out here's the filter you can see that's just it sits in the top of the bucket and so you will get some wax in here you'll get some bee parts you'll get you know just whatever kind of comes off the frames and so this filter what we like to do is we like to filter it enough to get the parts out that you don't want like wax and B parts but to keep in as much of the pollen as we can because that has a lot of the anti-allergy properties flavor and it has a lot of flavor and so we try to filter it the least amount possible to keep as much of that in as we can so that's six frames right there flowing down through the filter and we've got lots more to go all those boxes ready to go okay so now that these are out they weigh nothing and you can see hopefully I kind of tilt it that all the honey's out it kind of has a little bit of a shine to it still from the honey residue and so we will actually put these back in the hive right is that we're gonna do this year we've tried different things we'll probably put these back on top of the hive and let the honeybees just clean off the residual of the honey and then we'll store them for the winter for next year so we did much better this year the frames stayed in good shape we didn't spin it too fast and so these on the ready to go for next year for them to start building let me so you can see our bucket down here most of the honey has gone through and you can see what's in the bottom are just little pieces of wax and kind of mostly wax pieces that get caught by the filter and so that will just continue to kind of drain as we do more and more and the honey is all in the bottom bucket below it so we'll show a picture of that when we're all done okay the harvest thing works done here are the two buckets of honey I think you can see the lines of honey you know right right about there and right about there so maybe seven gallons I don't know it might be a little lighter than that in those two buckets so that'd be about 84 pounds and then around here I think you can kind of see the honey line on here so this is the bucket of cappings that we cut off and you know they're most of the way drained there's still some draining to go I can still see a lot of honey in there and so we'll let that drain a couple days and and but I don't think there's a gallon down there and so once once this drains and we'll put it out for the bees to clean the honey caps oh and we've put the boxes out there firm and clean I'll show you that in a second okay we put the honey frames out there about an hour ago so the bees have gun it found it this is I don't know maybe 150 feet from where our colonies are a lot of people really get worried about doing this because they say the bees get really aggressive and they do get a little aggressive around here but we don't really have a lot of trouble with them on there on the boxes you know robbing and everything else so but they're they've started working and I think it's going to get a little busier between now in the end of the day okay this is the last piece of the puzzle in terms of the bees cleaning stuff up just wanted to show you this is just a sticky mess you know see how it sticks to my fingers this is what it's like I mean this is stuff is just drenched in honey and I put it out for the bees and they clean it up into a flaky mess so none of the honey goes unused so I just I'll show you this this is kind of the before picture and then I'll show you the during when they were cleaning it up and then the after okay so now you can see just these are really working on the wax cappings and you can kind of see there's mounds and everything else but when they're done with it it'll be a just a flaky dry honey free pile of wax so it will take the most of the day to do it but they'll do a great job cleaning it off all right I wanted to show you what this stuff was like after the bees were done with it as you can see now they I mean they're just no honey it's just it's like it's like flakes they've cleaned up all the honey I mean there's a little sticky to it but nothing like it was before so so yeah it's amazing they're amazing little workers okay the long-delayed day has arrived we because we're using friends equipments equipment we kind of rushed our honey harvest and so it was a little wetter than it should be what honey you want to change for two reasons one is the the honey is more polluted because it has more water in it so it tastes even better if it's still drier but number two if it's too wet it'll ferment in the bottles and the honey won't last so we have we put the honey into a small closed room with a dehydrator and it sucked the moisture out and so now we're we finally arrive to where we are following honey and as you can see we've gotten a few we bottled a few and all of our bottles over here long way so all right we're all done there's a few bottles in art shown that have already found their final home but altogether we have about 93 pounds which isn't a lot but when you consider it is pretty much from one colony that's a pretty good take so hopefully next year we'll start with a few more colonies and hopefully have a record harvest until next year", "8Z3ScudsmVM": "wild blackberries just started blooming very early in this year today is April 1st they're millions of blackberry wild blackberry plants here billions of flowers so bees have a lot of work to do this year I hope it's going to be a lot of blackberry honey this flower smell amazing and the honeycomb was library smells amazing too so there are still flowers here and here some berries already so the bees take nectar and bee pollen from flowers they bring nectar and be fallen to the hive therefore shall be sly when there is a good nectar flow in the nature mmm other insects that collect nectar from this flowers so the bees started building honeycomb on this frame and I just put the frame with raw bees walks and they started building honeycomb they they they all just started putting honey in it this hive is full of honey let's check the second three okay full of honey that's good and this side is full of high now I want to show you how the eye and cap the honey because this is honeycomb caffeine's we cannot extract clinic if we do not open the can itself here so I just got it like this now these are highly competent here very good medicine and very delicious things to eat I don't do it like that I am doing it just for video to show how it works or this B wants to get some high here so I don't extract honey I don't cut honeycomb cuttings outside because sometimes bees come and try to get some hi after I finished removing honeycomb cuttings I will put the plate in this highly extractor when you hon extractor has all friends there then you can start extracting let's see what kind of hi we got this is the honey from wild blackberry flowers this is just fresh honey this is the kind of honey that you will not find in stores what you can find in stores is just fake honey from China mixed with some honey from United States probably 10% of real honey and 90% of honey from China which is toxic this is real honey it's like a medicine very healthy with no chemical in it there is no [Music] antibiotics or poisons because I don't use any antibiotics or poisons for bees so this kind of honey you can find only from natural beekeepers the beekeepers who do not use the bees for commercial pollination they don't use any chemicals on bees they don't use any medication on bees okay these are coming", "UUnaMfZtH8M": "[Music] backyard be builder here and today I wanted to talk a little bit about using raw honey for seasonal allergies to go over that I wanted to kind of show you how I do it okay you can see I have about one cup of raw honey that I just got out of my hive it's supposed to help with the allergies the pollen that's in the air around my area so you're gonna want to try to get some from your local area and then I have here about three tablespoons of cinnamon and now this this is you can add more or less depending on what you like but I'll just put this in here and mix it around so when I'm done mixing this I just make sure that it's in a container that I can put a lid on as you know honey will actually absorb moisture from the air and can cause fermentation if it gets above 25% so I just keep it in a in a container that I can easily open and then I can just take a spoonful each morning some people don't believe that this works and if that's why I teach is own don't get mad at me but this is actually something that I've struggled with it's seasonal allergies and so I do use my raw honey to help with now I am really sensitive to medicine and so if I were to take regular benadryl or something it just wipes me out makes me really really tired and so I choose not to take that medicine unless I absolutely have to but this seems to help and it's a lot like any other herbal or natural fixes that they are great for mild symptoms but don't necessarily work well for severe symptoms I've spoonful honey isn't gonna hurt anyone that's not diabetic so it's I don't mind having a spoonful of honey in the morning and the cleanup is half the fun so I'll seasonal allergies is something that you struggle with give it a try and I hope you enjoyed this video this is the backyard view builder see you next time", "YZoZr_m9WLU": "(bees buzzing) - [Coyote] Oh boy,\nstarting to get swarmed. Holy mackerel. Dude, you are like, covered\nin bees right now, man. Oh my gosh, my legs are shaking. (percussive music) (tranquil music) - [Coyote] A light breeze\ndrifts across the desert sand as morning sun crests\nabove the mountains. All seems calm amongst\nthe rocky outcrops, yet nestled down between\nthe cracks and ridges, a powerful giant\nquietly slumbers. To disturb this\ncreature by accident would be a literal nightmare. Disturb it intentionally\nand you will likely seal your own fate. Oh boy, starting to get swarmed. Holy mackerel. - [Coyote] It sounds as\nif I speak of a creature from a storybook, but\nthis is no creature of myth and lore. It is a very real animal\nthat, since the mid 1980s, has become one of\nthe southwest's most\nnotorious threats. Killer bees. So, what is a killer bee? Well, to keep it simple,\nit's basically a hybrid between an African and\na European honeybee. They're typically more\ndefensive, faster, and more aggressive\nthan other bee species. Tucson, Arizona is\njust one of the places that has recently fallen under\nthe cloud of killer bees, and today we will\nbe working alongside bee specialist Chris Britton. Chris monitors several\nbeehives that exist naturally in the mountainsides, and our\ngoal is to extract aged honey from a wild hive so we can\ncompare it to his locally farmed honey and determine\nwhich one is more delicious. Using a drone will\nhelp us locate the hive and determine exactly how\nwe should approach it. This is an incredibly\ndangerous mission, so to protect ourselves\nfrom the thousands of bees that will be swarming\nand trying to sting us, we will be wearing bee suits. We are taking extra precautions\nby taping up the wrists and ankles to ensure the\nbees cannot work their way into the suits. Okay, so, this is\nthe moment of truth. We are completely suited up. This is probably going\nto be one of the craziest and most dangerous\nthings we've ever done on an episode of Breaking Trail. The following scene was filmed under the supervision\nof bee specialists. Never approach a\nbeehive in the wild. - Okay, Chris, so this is\nkind of our last checkpoint, about as close as we\nfeel comfortable getting without the bees\nactually swarming out. Now, I'm looking at the\nhive and I see there's lighter-colored comb\non top, in the middle, it's slightly golden,\nand then at the bottom, it almost looks like it's brown. What's the best area for me to\nextract comb and honey from? - We're gonna go right to\nthe center of this hive. - Okay.\n- So, not on the dark and not on the completely light. That light stuff is not\ngonna have anything in it. At this present point in\ntime, the bees are working more into the layers of\ncomb, so you're gonna go right to, basically, the\nmiddle, where it's a little bit golden, but it starts to\nturn just a little bit, and there's some capped\nhoney right there. It may be last season's\nhoney, but it's right there where the bees are going\nto be working, and we'll be able to just get in\nthere and grab a bunch. - [Coyote] Okay, cool. Well, I think at this point,\nlet's get into the hive and get this honey. You guys all ready? Cutting into the hive causes\nno harm to the bees, and this extraction method is commonly\nused by honey farmers. In the wild, hives are\noften invaded by animals, which, in turn, causes an\nincrease with productivity, and in a matter of\ndays, the hive will be completely reconstructed. Okay, I'm right\nunderneath the hive. Whoa. Look at that. Do not want to get stung. Bees are starting to come out. You can see all the comb here. - [Chris] And over here. - [Coyote] They definitely\nknow that we're here. - [Chris] You hear 'em? - [Coyote] I can hear\n'em, they're going crazy. - [Chris] How hard is it? - [Coyote] Wow, it's\nhard, very waxy. Oh boy, starting to get swarmed. Holy mackerel. I'm nervous. You see, they're trying to\nsting in through the mask. (bees buzzing loudly) Here they come. This is the outer layer here. Dude, you are like, covered\nin bees right now, man. - [Chris] We gotta hurry up. (intense music) - [Coyote] We are\nabsolutely surrounded by killer bees right now. Fortunately, they are not\nstinging through the suit. I got a couple of\ngood pieces of comb, but I've already come out here. There we go, found\ncomb with honey. Some stingers are actually\ngetting through my suit. I am getting stung\nat this point. Ow. Jeez, okay, alright, I'm\ngonna cut out a big section of comb from right here in\nthe middle, can you see this? That is all filled with honey. I'm gonna cut through that and\nwe're gonna get out of here. Ugh, it's sticky! This is it, this is good honey! Oh, look at that! Okay. Woo! That is pure, golden honey! Alright, I'm gonna put it\ninside the mason jar here. Yep, here, let's\nback up a little bit. I can't even imagine what it\nwould be like to be out here and come across a\nswarm like this. This could definitely kill you. We are probably surrounded\nby 30,000 bees at this point. I mean, it's absolutely crazy. They're attacking the GoPro,\nthey're attacking the cameras. - The microphone. - [Coyote] The microphones,\neverything is getting bombarded by bees right now. - It's hard to even\ntouch the camera. They're just covered in bees. Like, you can't even tip the... - [Coyote] It's crazy. Alright, look at that,\nthat's about what we want, right there. Woo, that is absolutely\nfilled with honey. So what are we\ndoing here, Chris? - I'm basically covering\nthe air with smoke, so that way we can actually\nget the bees to change their pheromones so\nyou guys can walk away. - [Mark] 'Cause they'll\nfollow us to our car. - Oh, they'll sting you\nall the way to their car. Africanized honeybees\nknow no limits. - [Coyote] I can't even\nimagine what it would be like to be out here and come\nacross a swarm like this. This could definitely kill you. Wow. Well, we escaped the\nswarm of killer bees. Now, the next step is to\ncompare the killer bee honey to European bee honey and\nsee which one tastes better. To the victor go the spoils. What you're looking at\nright there are two jars of delicious raw honey. Now, right here, we\nhave honeybee honey, and on this side,\nthe killer bee honey. Now, we certainly had to\ngo through quite the ordeal to get both of these honeys. They're all in my face! We are absolutely surrounded\nby killer bees right now. But it was totally worth it,\nbecause this is the moment we have all been waiting for. The comparison between\nkiller bee honey and honeybee honey. Which one is better? You guys ready to find out? - [Mark] Oh yeah, I'm ready. Do we get to taste test also? - Oh, yeah, you guys are\ngonna taste this too. Okay, I'm gonna start\nwith the honeybee honey. We take off the cap here. Wow, that smells\nincredibly fresh. Big spoonful right there. - [Mark] Oh, wow.\n- I just go for it, right? - [Mark] I think you\ngo for the whole thing. - Wow. That's sticky. Oh, really sweet, I can\ntaste all those granules of honey, they're starting\nto disintegrate in my mouth. Wow. That is delicious, oh my gosh. That is an unbelievable honey. That might be the best\nhoney that I have ever had. Here, let me get a\nlittle bit of this honey on the tip of the knife. Go ahead there, Mark,\njust take a little squidge off there.\n- [Mark] Don't cut myself. - [Coyote] That's good, huh? - Wow, you could eat that\nstraight, like, all day. - Wow, I took a big\nspoonful of that. - [Mark] You feeling\nthe sugar rush yet? - Yeah, I think I'm about to. Now, this is what I've\nreally been excited about. Let me get a big...\n- [Mark] Get a gooey one. - [Coyote] Hunk of it\nout here, let me just scoop some out onto my hand. Yeah, I'm going full\nPooh-bear here, guys. Let me get my paw in there. Oh, yeah. I've always wanted to do that. Look at that honey. Look at the different\ncolors in the honey. You have the darker\nhoney, and you have the real light golden honey. Think it's gonna\nmake me throw up? - [Mark] Nah, man,\nit's like candy. - Whoa! That is crazy sweet! - [Mario] Put the rest in there. - [Mark] Can you\ndo the whole comb? Hey, Pooh-bear,\nhow's that taste? - Very sweet. - [Mark] Very sweet indeed. - This is almost making my\neyes water, it's so sweet. - [Mark] Bravo, I'm impressed. That was quite the honeycomb\nyou just had there. - Let me wipe off my\nface a little bit here. Little bit more presentable. Wow, that is so sugary! I'm gonna have a major sugar\nhigh for hours right now. You guys wanna try this, right? - [Mark] Yeah. - Stick your finger out, there. Just wait 'til it\ngets in your teeth. Soon as it hits your lips. - [Mark] Wow.\n- [Coyote] Right? Now, both of these honeys\ntaste amazing, but honestly? I think the killer bee\nhoney is a little more tasty and a little more... Gave me a rush of\nenergy, like, the second that it hit my mouth. But I think both types\nwould be excellent on anything that\nyou put them on. Although, going to get\nkiller bee honey is something that I can never recommend\nanybody out there watching ever try and go do. Probably the best way to do\nit is to buy from a local honey farmer and have\nsomething that's pure and granulated, just like this. And you put it on toast,\nyou can put it on... You name it, honey goes good\non absolutely everything. Ahhh, I can totally feel,\nlike, a sugar rush coming on right now, that is crazy. My hands are so sticky. - [Mark] Hey, Pooh-bear. - What? - [Mark] You get enough? - No! How did that silly old\nbear get his paw into that jar of honey all the time? - [Mark] He didn't get his\npaw stung by bees yesterday. - Yeah, I got fat paw right now. Watch this, two bee\nhoneys at the same time. (men yelling and groaning) Sugar rush! Full honey face. - [Mark] Mario, there aren't\nany bears out here, are there? \u266a Climbin' in a honey tree,\nPooh bear, I know he's out there \u266a It's me and it's you, oh\nsilly oh Winnie the Pooh - Well, I would say we\nendured quite a bit to get both of these honeys up\nclose for the cameras. Aside from wearing the bee\nbeard, which resulted in me being stung 32 times, to\nthen scaling the side of a cliff to extract comb and honey\nfrom a killer bee hive, we went through it all\nto do this taste test, and at the end of the day, I\nhave to say that the killer bee honey is actually\nthe most tasty. I'm Coyote Peterson,\nbee brave, stay wild, we'll see you on\nthe next adventure. One more handful. Ooh, that's some good honey. (inspirational music) There are many\nmisconceptions surrounding the Africanized honeybee. Or, as they have become\nfamously vilified by so many, as killer bees. Nearly all attacks happen\nwhen a hive is accidentally disturbed, or a swarm is\nprovoked by a non-professional who is attempting\nto exterminate it. And while many people\nare stung every year, very few deaths are\nactually reported. If you see a swarm or come\nacross a hive in the wild, quickly and quietly move\nin the opposite direction. And if you are looking\nfor some delicious honey, well, my advice is\nto support local and buy it from a honey farmer. If you thought getting swarmed\nby killer bees was intense, make sure to go back\nand see what happened when I tried to trade in my\nfur beard for a bee beard. And don't forget, subscribe! So you can join me and the crew on this season of\nBreaking Trail! They're all over my face! My eyes! Oh man, my face hurts. - [Mark] You should see the\nsting you have in your neck.", "ZMDE6QBmj0w": "the difference between raw honey and conventional only one is the way you find it inside to have the web is it conventional oneis is the result of a process to make it safe for conception as you will not wear any single trace of trace of light it will be pasteurized to 70% 70 degrees which is very iron killed the conventional is dead honey this is raw honey it is what is so special about the raw honey so raw honey as you refine into how you see which it's kept in versed so it's like in a jar instead and inside is a result of the world process and from enzymes when bees putting nectar and turn nectar into honey it's a very complex chemical metal is honey and basically old a lot of volatile components or very healthy and for the bees and for us and it's really alive like enzymes or living things you know so raw honey is wrong because it's its life but so that's why you want to make sure - honey this way because then you know you're not ruining anything as soon as soon as honey get in contact with Zee there yeah get outside and we start to oxidize and what I think compounds will just disappear and that's only why you wanna honey because you will get the full power food medicinal power of it as soon as you take it out its wax comb you will doesn't matter which technique you use you will lose all this medicinal property and all conventional instructions are made to speed black spinels because very fast and we take the frame and spin it very quickly so honey we'll just be kicked out of the cell go for the end and splash the water drips and then the tone will be pasteurizing filters and so on this process of taking out the the wax comb go for the air we change the molecular structure of the honey and you will have left sugar and the taste of it and yes it works and you have the properties and you chew it all together and you know you have it well and alive and as soon it comes in the jar doesn't matter if it's organic limited certified it will be dead okay and not well so its raw honey is just good where can I get it well you can get it high okay it's quite firm to be so oh you put yourself and to practice and stop natural beekeeping and get and if you cannot start beekeeping what you need to ask you'll be people to to turn natural beekeeping or at least to start producing company oh it's cold commercially company you will get the whole and you might not follow the wall natural practice of the bill at least supported seasonality consuming will be alive so after you get started now convince people to go natural be HIPAA okay we all think we know honey we know the taste of it and but we actually never talk about where does it come from how it's made and why is it so good obviously so to understand honey you need to understand be the work of reasons the life of bees and now they make honey so we get the nectar from flowers and they bring back to the hive and put them we will see that says and once the set is full they will start process lag it's the process which is very similar the process for me to cheese and the process from nectar to honey as it involves enzymes which are back degrees and those enzymes that bring vamsi bees from their saliva which means are gonna chew the nectar and bring some batteries that will make the process of hanging possible so once the set is fool as well this says these gonna keep ventilating the hive until all the moisture is gone and the nectar has turned to two honey which is a lot more complex matter you've been nicked on anywhere's enzymes and bacterias and flavors and we're gonna know now so what we know of honey's most is a test but actually honey is very powerful medicine as it holds what we call organic compounds volatile organic compounds which are actually part of the plants was a nectar confirmed when the plant you use to protect herself and to protect the nectar from going bad and going rancid and along was volatile organic compounds the most common ones the antioxidant plant chemical which are the ones plant produce and makes the nectar available and not going bad from a day to another like it would be do not visit a flower the nectar not gonna rot in the flowers were gonna stay fresh and stuff when honey does wear this capacity of being at the oxidant and for itself for the honey honey does never go bad when you eating honey will get a benefit another very important component of honey is hydrogen peroxide which is an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal basically and it's a so it was make honey being an antiseptic everything hahaha medicine hmm thank you [Music]", "HmBFgNvP3Ik": "so this has been a story for quite some time you know if you eat some local honey and if you have allergies little bits of exposure to the pollen may help desensitize you from the allergies and so it made a lot of sense but most of the research that we have right now suggests that's not the case in theory the reason why this doesn't appear to work is that mostly allergies that people are exposed to or develop are really from exposure to order called allergens that come from trees and grasses and things of that nature and so those are not the things that bees are actually feeding off of they're feeding off of flowers and so for that reason alone there's less reason to believe that actually using local honey can make a big difference for people with seasonal allergy first and foremost you want to work closely with your primary care doctor make certain that there's not something else that needs to be addressed but for the things that we can do ourselves remember we can do things like keeping the air in our home a little bit cleaner so we recommend using what's called a HEPA filter especially in the bedroom we actually recommend the use of something called a neti pot on a regular basis so neti pots they look like a little genies bottle that you then use to irrigate out the nose and so we usually recommend for people who have seasonal allergies when they're not having symptoms use the neti pot once a week when they are having symptoms use the neti pot twice a day just clean things out we have people who swear by their neti pots it really makes a difference one thing to keep in mind though never use tap water when using a neti pot because it actually can transmit some organisms that could be dangerous so you have to use either distilled water or you have to use sterile safe you", "BbVM-9P0lN4": "welcome to Maria's hell shop we are located

my second bee yard I've got four hives up here and I think I've got seven seven something like that in the house but it's been about a month since I've been in these hives because of weather and just being busy but the last time that I was in them they were getting pretty close to being ready to be harvested so what we're gonna do is we're gonna dig into these hives today and check them out and see how much honey can come out of them hopefully we'll get a pretty decent harvest out of them this year we did have some might issues if you remember that video that I posted about treating bee hives for my it's with might away quick strips we didn't have some Maya tissues but they have been treated and hopefully they're doing pretty good now we'll just see so let's go ahead and dig into these hives and see how much honey we can get out of them so I'm not exactly what you would call a professional beekeeper the way that I way that I harvest my honey I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos of beekeepers going into these hives and taking in charge boxes off but what I do is I'll just go into these hives I don't use Queen excluders because and I really don't have a moral opposition to them or anything but I don't use them because I guess they're just inconvenient to me I'm not really sure why I don't use them maybe I just don't understand them completely either way I don't use them so what I usually do is I'll just go into these hives since I don't use excluders I just harvest around the brood nest really Queens usually have a tendency to not lay eggs in the honey supers anyway and if they do during a good honey flow the bees will backfill that anyway so it's really not an issue look at that now that is some good stuff right there that is a good solid frame of honey and this one it looks like just about all of these are are ready to go let's pull some of these on the end as well and just see what they look like they have man they have propyl eyes I love this stuff these are some sticky sticky B's I tell you what if you can't bees and you don't have the maxint frame lifter tool you should definitely look into getting that because this has been an invaluable tool for me it has just built great us-made and see that's a good frame to a lot of times you know you're supposed to not harvest the frames that are not 100% capped but I've discovered that if you if you if you get the frames that are at least 90 or so percent cap you probably not gonna have any issues but you know if you have if you're scared about that and I'm always wearing when I do it to make sure you get the ones that are 100% cap because you're never gonna go wrong you're never gonna go wrong doing that so this is a great box right here we can get just about all of these let's uh oh that's heavy too let's get into this next box see what we've got it's been raining the last few days so my smokers having trouble staying with so this box right here not all most of the frames are ready to go but really not all of them so I'm gonna go grab a box and just kind of pull out the ones that I can use so guys you can see right here there's a lot of a lot of cross comb going on on this side and the reason that that's going on is because I'm sure that I'll harvested a couple of frames or something like that and didn't put the frames back so if you harvest frames individually make sure you put the frames back because your bees are gonna they're just kind of going to do what they want to do and they're gonna mess you up so what I do is I just take these frames out and shake the bees off just an empty hive body close to me to put these frames in and these are these are great right here see this one right here is a good example I won't have any trouble extracting this and I can be pretty confident that it's not going to firm it because we've got at least 90% of these frames I mean these cells capped off and this looks like what happened here was probably some drone comb that was late and hatching and it just took them a little while to get it back filled but yeah this frame this frame is going to be fine and you can tell this is a good strong solid box of these cuz they're just have been putting back Kenny like nobody's business these are nice pretty frames now you've got to be considerate of the bees make sure you leave them enough honey there's gonna be a dearth a lack of incoming resources and it's got to make sure that they have enough food to survive through that I don't know exactly where this brood chamber starts so let's go ahead and see what else we've got oh look at that we'll save that and we can do something with that you get the bees off of it I can use that for my own purposes I probably I wouldn't sell that because a lot of the cells are uncapped and there's a there's a possibility that that could firm yet but smokers out I'm gonna have to do something about that but I'll take this and I'll probably put this in a Tupperware container and I can use it on my post in the mornings so if y'all are wondering one of these frames are labeled the way that they are it's probably difficult for y'all to see but when I first started beekeeping and that was in 2012 I am achill treatments in my house pesticide based treatments and see that how that that one is we're not gonna do anything with that obviously if it is it's very encouraging to see though because there's eggs in here so I know the queen is just doing fun but anyhow when I first started beekeeping in 2012 I used chemical based treatments I think I used a mattress which would have been is it Apple for something like that but I used that to control my mites and man that is a solid pattern it's hard oh there she is there's our queen right there tell me while we've got her let's um see if we can get her marked real quick it's may be this year's Queen so let me go grab a marker and more marker so this marking method I'm sure it's fairly common I used to use well I still use fairly recently actually the you know the Queen cage and all that stuff to mark to mark these queens because mostly because I'm just nervous because it's such a these all these are so delicate you know and it's difficult to I'm always afraid I'm gonna rip a wing off or something but this method is the method that I learned off of the fat bee man's channel and if y'all are not subscribed to him check him out he's got a lot of good stuff on beekeeping but essentially you just grab them by the wing with one of your hands and then with your other hand grab them by the legs and she should be fine if your delicate and then just let that little bottle paint dry off some this year is a reason that I'm using red if y'all were wondering this year is ins an 8 and the years that end in 8 and 3 he's red paint used at the end of 11 and 17 you use yellow paint and there's also blue and white and green can't remember what years those are but just let that set up for a little bit and make sure it's not gonna be picked off by the other bees and then just let her out and you've got yourself a marked Queen make sure she makes sure she's doing okay those bees will probably try to get some of that off of her but she should be fine and that was successfully marked Queen say no and what I was saying before I got so distracted is I used to use chemical based treatments in my hives and the reason that I've got be on this one right here is because that frame can only be used for brood at this point because it was in the hives when those chemical based treatments were being used after that first year I decided I wanted to go organic I did not go to treatment free I decided to go organic instead and that frames got a bunch of brood drone comb on it so we're gonna leave it alone and I just wanted to be able to designate the frames that I could not extract out of because they possibly have chemical residue left in them I don't want that in my honey so I don't want to sell it to other people for them either so anyhow the ones that say essay on them those can be used for brood or honey or whatever these you decide to use them for but the ones that just have a bee on it they can only be used for brood and that's just how that's just I my hives are set up but anyhow that's how we're all we're gonna get out of this box let's put this one back together and move on to the next one so it's important to try to move through these hives kind of speedily because because you don't know if there's a dearth on and if the dearth is going your you're gonna have trouble with robbing on the in these hives especially when you've got them open and you've got open boxes of honey sitting around on the back of your truck and it's important to go ahead and get this done and not not uh not waste time once you have a robbing situation it's can be a challenge to get that stopped it looks like I'm gonna have to spend some time at some point fixing these hives you can see this hive body has become warped from the rain and she's got some got some issues yes I'm not gonna extract this box right here because there's just not not a lot going on in there I'm gonna go and replace this box now it's it's trashed so when you go to replace boxes it's important not critical but it's you know somewhat important to make sure you put the frames and stuff in the same order that they came out because the bees work fairly hard to get the setup in the hives that they want so anyhow it's important just to get the try to put it back in relatively the same order that they came out yeah well this is the hive right here that I dread going into every time these are the most aggressive bees that I've got and once you get them riled up they're just not any fun to deal with but a lot of times it's the aggressive bees that give you the most production so we'll just see what they look like Miss Honey it smells so good it just leaves me leaves me in awe every time that these creatures were created in such a way that they could go out that's a nice frame that they could go out has a little bit left on that but it'll be okay these creatures were created in such a way that they can go out and they can get all the good stuff out of these trees and flowers and bring it back to these hives and put it up in a form that man was able to tame them essentially it was the Reverend Langstroth have invented these or discovered the concept of bee space that said the Creator may be seen in all the works of his hands but none so clearly in the wise economy of the honeybee and I'm climbed to agree with that because the the efficiency at which these things operate is just it's just beyond anything the stuff that they do and their ways and that is a picture perfect frame right there you could put that in a textbook this one right here I'm going to take there's only half of a frame there but we can still spend that half side out we're on to the next box and guys this is a really good example the reason that you need to be keeping your beehives in good order good working order there's a reason that links trough developed these hives with moveable combs and if you are in the habit like I am sometimes of extracting honey then leaving these combs out this is the problem you're gonna run into it you see that that's just a mess and I've got to clean that out for silver lining is that I can make comb honey out of that so it's the next day now and this is my setup that we're going to use for extracting this honey we washed off everything real good and got everything good and disinfected and we're gonna go ahead and extract this honey because that's only one box right there we actually got about four boxes almost full of honey so I'm excited to see how much honey we get out of it but this is just the bucket that I decaf in and this is gonna be the bucket that we drain into until it gets full then we'll swap and this is my this is my extractor it's a it's a pretty old extractor it was my granddaddy's it's just a to frame extractor and it works really well it is kind of slow because you got to stop and flip the frames but it does a really good job and hopefully hopefully I'll be able to get a new extractor at some point because I'd really love to have a new one preferably with its own legs but anyhow let's go ahead and get started and see how much honey we can get out of this so ideally what you want is those cappings to protrude just a little tiny bit above above the level of the wooden frame so that she can get a good good cut cut off on those campus this one's pretty decent a lot of these Springs we're really not pulled up all that far but we've got of course after this I'm gonna let all those captain's dream as well but of course I don't have a caffeine spin or anything like that [Music] [Music] Keshawn were wandering these buckets are food-grade buckets that I got from Apple processing warehouses in North Georgia all I did was I went in and you know before you buy your apple turnovers and stuff like that you say ask whoever's behind the counter if they have any spare buckets available because they buy all this billing that they use for those pies and stuff and they buy it it comes in these food grade buckets and they don't really do anything with them and I think I gave a dollar a piece for most of my buckets and you wash them over and over and over again and that'll last for last for years and years and years and you can't buy at Lowe's if you want to I don't think they're very expensive there either but you know if you're just around those places you know the fall and the apples come in just ask they probably will sell you some for for a pretty good price after I get a box done all I do is I come out and set the Box on my truck like this and eventually that'll be a good swarm of bees here to clean it all up now just a quick note about about putting the boxes out for communal cleanup of your from your bees that's something that's okay to do if you're you know positive that you don't have any foul brood in your hives but if you're not so sure about that you might not want to do because you always risk the possibility of cross-contamination and you don't want to spread foul brood of course so after I get done extracting all of the frames I'll just take the cappings and I'll essentially do what you would call a crushing strain method on them I will do this to get all those cappings and wax cells broken up really good and then I'll just dump it in the strainer and let it sit maybe overnight a few hours or overnight until now those get those get drained out well enough and then I'll dump those cat things out and and put more in because of course there's a lot of cappings and they can't all fit in there at the same time but you'd be really shocked at how much honey is held in this this slurry right here I mean that's that's heavy I'll probably get now probably 15 pounds of honey out of this right here [Music] you", "k_MUon6mApU": "Hey, guys. Dr. Axe here, Doctor of Functional Medicine\nand founder of DrAxe.com. Today I want to talk to you about the incredible\nbenefits of manuka honey and how you can use it to cure certain illnesses and really support\nthe body in many different ways. Manuka honey has been used throughout areas\nof New Zealand and Australia for a really long time. The incredible thing about manuka honey is\nin certain cases it tends to be about four times more nutrient-dense in terms of its\nhealing compounds than regular floral honeys. You've heard me talk about before the benefits\nof raw honey and local honey. Well, manuka honey is even more powerful. I'm going to go through all of those benefits\nhere, but the reason why manuka honey is so beneficial is because it tends to be much\nhigher in certain types of enzymes that create a type of hydrogen peroxide or phenols, these\nphytonutrients that you're going to find in manuka honey. So again, it has very powerful antimicrobial\nproperties. There are several things it's great for treating,\nand one of those things is SIBO, that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. So if you have bad bacteria growing in your\nsmall intestine, oftentimes that's caused by bad bacteria growing like H. pylori in\nyour stomach and not having enough stomach acid. Actually manuka honey is effective at treating\nthat. This is actually a brand of manuka honey I've\nused. There's a few other brands here, and you can\nsee it says \"20 Plus Bioactive Manuka Honey.\" Again, you want to be looking for manuka honey\nthat's typically . . . it depends on how you're using it. If you're using it for treating something\ntemporarily, you typically want to go about 16 to 20 Plus. If you're just consuming it in your food and\nwant those benefits, you typically want to go with a 10 Plus or less when you're actually\nlooking at the activity rating there. That's how strong those phenol-like compounds\nare. When you're actually taking this, the recommended\ndosage is never more than one tablespoon at a time. In fact, with most of my patients I recommend\nthey do one teaspoon twice a day when they're using manuka honey, but it's great, just a\nlittle bit of sweetener there, that you can add as well. Again, it's great for small intestinal bacterial\novergrowth. It's also very great in treating ulcers. If you have ulcers or stomach issues, this\nis the best sweetener to use and using it as a supplement, one teaspoon twice a day. It's also powerful at eliminating allergies\nand a sore throat. One of the most common treatments for a sore\nthroat is raw honey and lemon. Well, manuka honey is even more effective\nthan regular honey. I recommend mixing a little bit of lemon essential\noil with manuka honey and swallowing that probably about three to four times a day,\nand it can help soothe a sore throat. The other thing that this is really effective\nfor is treating acne and eczema. In fact, if you have acne or eczema, I recommend\nmaking an ointment at home using manuka honey along with essential oils like tea tree oil\nand geranium oil. Mixing these together is a very powerful treatment\nfor acne. With eczema you also want to add a little\nshea butter, and that will help keep it on the area even longer and actually help really\nhydrate that area. Also, here's one of the most incredible things\nabout manuka honey. It's been used effectively in the treatment\nof MRSA. MRSA is a type of bacterial infection that\ntends to be antibiotic-resistant. It's antibiotic-resistant, and manuka honey\nhas natural antibiotics that can actually kill off MRSA. That's just another powerful effect. And last but not least, wounds. If you have a cut or a burn of any type, I\nrecommend using manuka honey. If you have an open infection, put manuka\nhoney on the area. This is how it's been used for thousands of\nyears. It was used by the early Egyptians. It was used by the Chinese. It's referenced throughout history as well\nin many different ways. But again, manuka honey should be used in\ntreating wounds as well. You want to be looking for that different\nrating system that I talked about and typically one teaspoon twice a day. So again, try manuka honey. I will say this. It's a little bit spendy. You have to spend more on it, but the healing\nbenefits, if you have any one of those conditions, are worth it. And hey, if you don't have one of those conditions\nand you just want to experience the benefits of honey, then buy raw local honey from your\nlocal farmer's market. Raw local honey that isn't manuka honey still\nhas tremendous benefits, especially if it's raw and local. And hey guys, if you've enjoyed this video\non the many benefits of manuka honey, make sure you check out the article I wrote on\nmanuka honey here on DrAxe.com as well as our YouTube page. You can subscribe there and check out more\nof my natural healing remedies there as well. Hey guys, this has been Dr. Axe with the many\nbenefits of manuka honey.", "WozKwVTqgog": "Hey, guys, Dr. Axe here. Welcome to the Chopping Block. Today, our guest on the Chopping Block is\nhoney. Honey is a sweetener that has been used for\nthousands of years, and it has some health benefits and maybe some negatives along with\nit. We will see in the end if honey gets chopped\nor not. Now little bit of background on honey over\nthe last hundred years is honey has been started to be bottled by big companies, and there\nwas a study done recently at Texas A&M University. When they went and tested 60 different brands\nof honey, they found 77% of brands of honey contained no pollen whatsoever. The reason is most honey today is it's heated. It's ultra filtered to where what you get\nonce you finally get it in the bottle is no pollen, which is where most of the health\nbenefits come from. Also they filtered out the proteins, the antioxidants,\nand they've damaged some of the vital nutrients that are found in real raw honey today. So that's what one are the major problems\nwith honey is there's a lot of honey fraud going on, where when they tested companies\nlike Walmart, Costco, KFC, and McDonald's, they found that their honey contained zero\npollen and zero of these other nutrients whatsoever. So there's a lot of bad honey out there. Let me talk about the good in honey. If you look at honey and it being found in\nits raw form, like I have in this bottle right here, raw local honey is packed with pollen. Pollen can actually help boost your immune\nsystem and help you fight allergies. One major benefit is the immune boosting and\nthe allergy fighting effects of honey. Another major benefit of raw local honey can\nbe it can actually heal wounds. If you get a cut on your arm or are trying\nto heal a cut, again you can put this directly on it. It also can fight off bad bacteria in your\nsystem. So again, there are a lot of benefits of honey. The one other negative of honey is that it\ndoes contain some sugar. Now it's one of the most natural forms of\nsugar and fructose. But if you are trying to really lose weight\nor burn fat or trying to get sugar out of your diet, then you probably don't want to\nbe consuming really any sugars whatsoever, and so you may take honey off the list. So when it comes to honey being on the Chopping\nBlock, honey is not getting chopped. We're keeping it here. We're keeping it whole. Again, honey is my absolute favorite all natural\nsweetener. Just remember, use honey in moderation, and\nit is staying here on the Chopping Block and it is not getting chopped.", "ovVk3-zLaI0": "all right so the day has come for us to harvest honey so this is our super honey box that is on this is our hive number one and we're going to be taking the the individual frames out shaking the bees off as best we can then we're going to be walking over a little ways away brushing off any bees that are remaining and then tucking them inside another box and covering them with the towel and then we're going to be taking all of those frames that are full of honey over to a friend's house to actually do the extracting and we'll take a video there so we'll do a few frames on the video and then take them and then we'll take the video when we actually get to the extracting part what so this is a frame full of caft honey all white so I want to first bring the brush down here brushing here not hard okay here maybe I'll give you them to brush fighting you do the brushing them still quite a few bees on here I was hoping the shaking would take a few more off but yes okay all right we'll probably just show a couple of shapes since it's not probably super interesting just watching a shake bees off okay we've shook all the bees off of the frames of honey and we've got a full box on the bottom and then on top we have half of a box so as you can see there are the frames of honey oops we got to be trying to get in there they can smell this so I'm going to turn this off and we're going to head over to the honey house alright we're in our friends honey house there's the frames that we pulled out we got in here with no bees and I'm just going to do a quick scan of the equipment that is the extractor it spins and it gets the honey out and then when the honey's by centrifugal force spins out it goes into that bucket and that's the capping table where we cut off the wax capping out ready to begin alright so this is one of our frames actually where the wax caffeine's are a little bit outside the edge of this wood frame they're built a little bit out which is ideally what we will get to next year when they build it out a little more and so it makes it a lot easier to use to extract it with a heated knife which is what this is so this is you can see it's kind of bubbling the honey that's on there so what you do you ready looking serious so you kind of just set it on the edge you can slide it all the way up and it just takes those wax caffeine's you can tell it's a little bit uneven just takes the wax caffeine's off the outside and that falls down into the bucket there is somebody that falls with it but that will actually go through this filter and come out the bottom so we can actually extract this honey out as well the hot knife just kind of slices right through takes the caps off the outside like when it gets near this the top it doesn't do as well so that took most of the wax off then the honey starts to drip out we'll do the backside now which is a little bit further in we have to use a different tool for that this sometimes will work a little bit this actually is looking will get a little bit of the wax cappings off it started today it again understand still yeah so use that as much as we can and then we have this little comb that you use to kind of just go under and pry it off a little bit this was the start at the top for Dawn very sticky business so just about got all the wax cappings off of this frame and what you what we try to do is leave so inside underneath these the wax cappings is the honeycomb that's all filled with honey and we try to keep as much of that honeycomb preserved in place so that they start with all that honeycomb at the beginning of next year that they don't have to rebuild the honeycomb and so we tried you try to just take as little of the wax cappings off as you can to preserve the honeycomb underneath and then once this is all spun out we'll actually put it outside and let the bees clean off the remaining bits of honey will store the this frame over the winter and then you put this in their hive at the beginning of next year and they've already started with honeycomb that's already been built out underneath here and after we spin extract these will do well video a little bit what they look like after the honey has been extracted out you do finish just this last little piece and then this frame is ready to go in the extractor and what's fabulous is it tastes really good all right you wanna show sector whoops yeah so what we do is we flip this upside down so it stops dripping this goes inside extractor and all this does is spin at a high speed Carolyn there I'm doing it the right way ironing this one alright so you can see we have six frames two four six in the extractor we're just going to start it a little bit just to see how balanced it is actually that's pretty balanced because it's not wobbling very much so we're going to start spinning there you can see our first batch of money out of the extractor and they recommend that you flip the frames flip positions just to make sure that they get really good and spun on both sides so we'll slide those over they're a little harder to get in than we expected here man although these are much lighter than they were when we put them in here they're pretty heavy with honey when you first put them in so now they're much much lighter but still a little bit of honey in there so all right so this is what a frame looks like after the honey has been syn extracted out of it I'm just going to grab it up close so you can see all those little honeycomb cells and they are empty you can see we kind of made a mess of it right there that's probably Ricky miss Jake but these look great and I think that's what happens when they're out built out a little bit further and you can use the knife that just gets a nice clean cut on the other side whereas the ones that we have to use those comb that little comb and dig it out you can see it just doesn't come out quite as good but this frame will get left outside the bees will go in and clean up any honey that's in here to the point that they'll be really dry and then we'll put these downstairs and when we put them back in the hive next spring the bees will actually fix all of this where the wax is kind of messed up they'll just use the wax and repair it and then they'll start building it further out this way so that next year we'll be able to use the knife on most of it all right all right so I just wanted to show where after the honey comes out of the extractor you can see it's still dripping just a little bit then what's in the bottom of there are just pieces of wax that have kind of spun out and what's difficult to see is that that's actually a really fine mesh filter so it's catching all of the wax caffeine's and pieces of wax and then the honey is draining through into the bucket underneath and then you can see there there's a pour spout that we can take the bucket we'll take it home and then fill up our honey jars with that and then I also wanted to show kind of what's happening in here you can see in the bottom of there the honey that's in the bottom of that bin so the wax terpenes already got Troy's arm in that picture the wax drippings from taking off the caffeine's are going through they're falling into the bottom bin and you can see that that's not a very fine filter it's catching just the big pieces so there will be wax pieces in the bottom we will take the honey that's in the bottom container and put it through this same filter here so we'll pour that honey into here and filter it through that mesh filter so this is considered a for what's called a 400 mesh filter they have 600 400 and 200 400 is what most people do if you're going to take honey to to the State Fair or something like that to try to win an award the judges typically like the honey to be crystal crystal clear and so you would use a 200 filter to get it even more finely filtered but most people feel like 400 is enough and and you still get some of the pollen and other things in the honey that help with the allergies there's a lot of people who eat local honey because it helps them with their allergies and so people feel like with the 400-level mesh strainer or filter that you get a lot of those properties stone and it doesn't strain out the good stuff in the honey so we are just about done we're in our last two frames we'll run those last two pieces through the last two frames through the extractor and then we'll add to this video at some point as soon as we start putting them in bottles that's when the exciting stuff comes and oh it just is so good I could just drink it right out of the spigot mmm yummy yummy all right part of the part of the cleanup process is getting the honey off of the frame so that you can store them hopefully it's close enough that you can see see if I can zoom in a little bit way anyway if you can tell there's a lot of bees on those colonies I mean on those frames cleaning them up you just set them out here about 30 minutes ago and they clean it up and take every bit of honey off and you take it back to their hive and reuse it here's a little zoom you can see how many bees are just on that one frame and we when we drove up in the car just a minute ago they're just bees everywhere right now flying around so cleaning up the honey just another shot of the robbing of the cleaning up of the old hives and I wanted to zoom in a little bit what you can see is if you look carefully that when there's robbing going on can you see all the wax down there that's falling off of the frames it's because the bees don't take any care when they're robbing to be careful and so they literally just kind of rip it apart a little bit so this is going on a couple hours and as you can see it's still going on strong so it seems a little bit calmer than it was earlier but I just wanted to kind of show you that that that wax that's just literally that they're just breaking off the comb that's falling and you can see there's a lot of fighting going on too so that's what happens when they start robbing all right so this is what it's all about filling up the jars with the finished product this is pretty exciting stuff so here we go liquid gold Kepler and there you have it one and a half pounds of delicious honey okay the last step of the cleanup process is we took our wax cuttings that were off of the frames put them on a cookie sheet and we're letting the bees clean up the wax so they'll remove all of the honey off of the wax and then we'll melt it down so there's what's left of well it's covered in bees and then we also had from the wax cuttings there was a metal grate that the honey falls down so you can collect the honey but the wax stays on top but obviously there's some residual honey and we've left that up for the bees to clean up also so they're just about done with the frames but I think because we put out the new sources of clean up that we've attracted quite a few peas again so just continuing with the cleanup process kind of fun all right here's our final product we've got just about 49 pounds of honey and in the little canister over here in this right here that's that's a the all the wax cappings that we cut off that the bees cleaned out today so it's all free of honey and we're going to melt it into a wax cake but pretty exciting our first year we're done and 49 pounds okay we're getting to the next to the last step melting the the wax cuttings so as you can see we've collected all the wax cuttings from our recent work and they're pretty dry and fluffy after the bees of clean plus we have some per cone that we've taken off some of the pies before what we do is we have a little framed in screen filter we put it over this glass bread pan and then you use a towel to filter it so we just put the towel right on top it out and we take some of our wax cuttings and we put them on there and in retrospect we might have built a little bit larger of one of these but you know you can do that on the next run so we'll do this and then it'll melt it will filter through the the paper towel and end up being really nice clean honeycomb or actually lapsim wax so we'll put it into our solar wax heater which I made I just basically took a styrofoam cooler and painted it black and it has cut out a spot for the lid so it works like that and we'll just put it right on top and put everything in and put it out in the Sun and then check in after it's all melted after we do a couple of rounds of it okay I just pulled the final melted wax product out of the solar wax melter which is right there and what you see after it all melts down is the residual mostly honey probably in this case is left on the filter and you're left with a golden actually this color is kind of different I actually brought out the one we did from the other comb and the other ones quite a bit more yellow you can kind of see the difference in the color so the wax cuttings are more of a mozzarella cheese color instead of that golden color so that kind of surprised me anyway that's the end of our honey harvest so the final wax product", "1gQZlDXkTvU": "[Music] [Applause] hey once upon a time rudolf steiner said nothing is better for the human being than to add the right amount of honey to his food people have used raw honey in traditional medicine for many years it's even utilized in some hospitals as a treatment for wounds many of those health benefits are specific to raw or unpasteurized honey okay let's see what's raw honey honey is a sweet golden liquid made by honeybees honeybees store their honey in small hexagonal cups called a honeycomb raw honey comes straight from the honeycomb honey from the hive contains bee pollen beeswax and parts of dead bees honey manufacturers will usually pass raw honey through a filter to get rid of as many impurities as possible but some generally remain it's still safe to eat unlike raw honey regular honey undergoes a pasteurization process this implies manufacturers have heated it to kill yeast cells which will affect its taste increase its shelf life and make it look more transparent and attractive however pasteurization may adversely affect the number of nutrients within the honey if you're curious about trying raw honey buy it from a trusted local producer here are some health benefits raw honey has got to offer okay first a decent source of antioxidant researchers believe that some of the main health benefits from honey come from its antioxidant content natural honey contains a spread of compounds that act as antioxidants including phytochemicals flavonoids and ascorbic acid antioxidants reduce oxidative stress within the body by mopping up free radicals scientists have linked oxidative stress to a range of chronic health conditions including many cancers by eating an antioxidant rich diet people can reduce their risk of chronic disease some people believe that pasteurization reduces the number of antioxidants within the honey meaning that pasteurized honey might not offer equivalent benefits as raw honey there is no specific research into how pasteurization affects the antioxidants in honey but studies show that heating other foods can reduce their antioxidant content secondly protecting the brain some evidence suggests that honey may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory powers which will benefit the brain an animal study found that rats that consumed honey had protection against brain damage caused by exposure to guide besides a review states that raw honey may contain ingredients that help fight inflammation within the hippocampus a section of the brain involved in memory by the way if you're new to the channel a sub will be amazing third antibacterial and anti-fungal properties honey is a natural antibacterial and antimicrobial agent it contains hydrogen peroxide and glucose oxidise and features a low ph level which suggests it can kill harmful bacteria and fungi also thanks to its unique chemical composition it doesn't help yeast or bacteria to grow because of its antibacterial action people can use it to cleanse wounds research has shown that manuka honey which is a kind of raw honey can kill common pathogens fourth wound healing numerous studies have suggested that honey works well as a wound healing dressing also honey is acidic which helps release oxygen from the wound and promote healing manuka honey is used in medical settings to treat wounds because it's been found to be an efficient germ killer and also aids in tissue regeneration studies show that manuka honey can boost healing time and reduce infection keep in mind that the honey utilized in hospital settings is medical grade meaning it's inspected and sterile it's not a decent idea to treat cuts with honey you purchase from a store fifth raw honey is a nutrient powerhouse honey contains specific nutrients that can make it a healthful addition to the diet the exact nutrition and chemical composition of raw honey varies between different countries and environments and depend partly upon which sorts of flowers the bees gather their nectar from notwithstanding these factors honey still contains healthful compounds like antioxidants amino acids and vitamins 1 tablespoon or 21 grams of raw honey contains 64 calories and 16 grams of sugar these values may vary between brands and batches honey naturally contains sugar a bit quiet half the sugar and honey is fructose research has linked fructose to varied health problems however even with its fructose content honey could also be a healthier option than table sugar some research suggests that honey may offer a protective effect against diabetes and a few varieties of honey may help improve cholesterol levels people who have diabetes or who are on sugar restricted diets may prefer to eat honey carefully to avoid significant changes in their blood glucose levels pure honey features a glycemic index of 58 meaning it's a medium effect on blood glucose levels 6. soothe the sore throat have a cold try a spoonful of honey honey is an old sore throat remedy add it to hot tea with lemon when a chili virus hits you it also works as a cough suppressant research has suggested that honey is as effective as dextromethorphan a standard ingredient in over-the-counter cough medication just take one or two teaspoonfuls many cough medicines aren't safe for younger children to take so honey could also be a good alternative for children over one year older one small-scale study found that milk and one form of honey mixture relieved children's coughs as effectively as an otc medicine to relieve cough take a teaspoon of raw honey and avoid other liquids or foods afterward to allow the honey to coat the throat 7. help for digestive issues raw honey may have a soothing effect on digestion helping with symptoms of diarrhea a study of 150 children with acute gastroenteritis found that those that received honey with an oral rehydration solution had a far better recovery from diarrhea than those that didn't receive honey the children who received honey had fewer bowel movements and recovered faster from the illness to help treat mild diarrhea try taking a teaspoon of raw honey or mixing honey with a drink avoid taking an excessive amount of honey because excess sugar can make diarrhea worse okay let's see the risk involved in taking raw honey as long as an individual isn't allergic to bee pollen raw honey is mostly safe to use the centers for disease control and protection cdc say that individuals shouldn't give honey to infants under the age of one due to the danger of infant botulism honey is safe from the age of one upwards this applies to both raw and regular honey now by summing up the video raw honey may contain nutrients that regular honey doesn't this suggests raw honey could potentially offer more or more powerful health benefits however research has not confirmed this raw honey may contain extra elements like bee pollen and beet propolis which may offer additional antioxidant and antibacterial properties research on the medicinal uses of raw honey is promising the studies on its healing properties and nutrition suggest that raw honey could also be a more healthful sweetener than sugar if you enjoyed this video and want to hear from me again be sure to hit that subscribe button", "eGM_WcoP538": "April flowers don't just bring May showers they bring allergies as well throw in tree pollen grass pollen and ragweed and you're bound to smart and wanting to sneeze just listening to this word so what do you do about it honey is often a suggestion News 4's Terry Bulger working for you to see if the experts agree it's the annoying sound of spring that's sniffle and if you've tried everything can honey really be the answer if nature created the things flying in the air that cause allergies can nature also put a stop to it for a hundred years the Johnson family on South Dickerson Road says yes honey is really good for your allergies especially local honey we usually recommend the wildflower is a little bit better just because it's more a variety of everything the bees pollinate it really it really does help it sounds like science the idea is eating local honey with bees from here immunizes you to the pollen we inhale every day that's why so many sniffers come to this trusting place hoping if they're not here you'll take the honey and leave the money a lot of our customers come for allergies they wonder for allergies or sinus infection or sinuses or just overall but especially this time of year that's our main thing I would say that's the main question we get every day but scientists and doctors take the sting out of that theory this from Minnesota's Mayo Clinic does honey work probably not honey's been anecdotally reported to lessen symptoms in people with seasonal allergies but these results haven't been consistently duplicated in clinical studies such a statement won't stop the A+

for a loop so as we were finishing our dinner our little boys came in to tell us that they found a swarm of bees in a cherry tree just 20 feet away from our hives now I know these are my bees because I was lazy about checking them and they ran out of room and what they do when they run out of room to store honey is they break the hive in two and half of the hive goes on and you know starts anew so these are my bees they belong in my bee box so even though we want to tuck in for the night we're gonna go capture our first swarm of honey bees [Music] you'll notice I'm wearing Stuart's pyjama pants well that's because I'm a about bee stings and I really don't want them to go through my jeans so so it goes all right my plan is to just take my bee box take it over there and cut the frames off drop them into the box and cross my fingers hope for the best this is not like here we go I do have a very handsome assistant to help me tonight lucky me all right you ready let's get the V box I just happen to actually have an empty hive from one of the bee hives that we kept last year that we lost through the winter so two of ours are great and going strong obviously strong enough to swarm so this is just an empty bee hotel waiting for some visitors it's actually really important to that we get this swarm out of this cherry tree because in just a couple of weeks there's going to be a bunch of Pickers in this orchard climbing up into this cherry tree and that would be quite the surprise for them to find amongst the branches all right I'm gonna need your help [Music] are you shaking oh I'm shaking so bad that was terrifying I mean there was probably 10 or 15 pounds of bees in there it would seem [Music] so this is the hive that it originally slit from and now hopefully they'll just fix their comb and call this home we got the Queen so this is what's left in the tree now and the thing about bees is you can relocate them but if their queen is not with them they are not gonna do well and I was had adrenaline pumping so bad when I did it I didn't notice that last teeny a little bit of frame right here that they've built so we're gonna try and get just a little bit more just to make sure that this is as successful as it can be oh I'm shakin [Music] seventy bees on me that was terrifying when you have your head up into a gigantic pile of bees it's just exhilarating and horrifying at the same time but I did manage to sneak away with a taste of the wild honey I can get out of this thing help me they were not happy about it but we'll give them a check in a couple days to see how they take into their new home are you Wow have a taste Wow what you doing everything is fine here you want to try one of the things we really love to do as a family is to grow food and that's demonstrated in the fruit trees that we've planted the gardens that we've tented for all these years and of course harvesting the honey from these bees they are a vital and respected part of this homestead it's amazing to think how much of the other work we do actually goes into benefiting the bees and of course we enjoy all the flowers and all the other fruiting plants that we we grow but the bees get to benefit from it as well so it's it's it's like we're working for them almost it's kind of a very mutually beneficial relationship isn't it because we've created this oasis of all different varieties of flowers and plants for them to harvest and enjoy and not even just the honeybees but the bumblebees too there's all kinds of flying creatures around these gardens and the bonus is we get to harvest honey at the end of it all it is fun to know that the honey that you get from these bees came from them pollinating the flowers we grow so just like we harvest you know the fruits and veggies that we tend to hear we get to harvest honey from the bees that are that are working hard to to produce something edible as well and yummy and each year it's different each year it's a special vintage of what's blooming what flowers have done really well it's unique to our area it's one of the most creative hard work filled live foods imaginable [Music] you [Music]", "l1qy4c-wR-0": "[Music] just a typical day in rural new jersey for cam johnson he's getting ready to smoke some bees out of their hives he and his wife summer started a beekeeping business in bucolic hunterdon county new jersey and it's clearly a family affair how did you guys get started in this venture we got started because our son zachary had bad allergies we were pretty much heartbroken like any parent we just were giving him lots of medicine uh steroids we were in the er and um i think we just read we read that you know raw honey especially local honey was really good for as a cough suppressant to introduce the body to natural allergens that research led them to buy these wood screen boxes and italian bees it's really more of an experiment [Music] my husband started beekeeping and over about a year's time we noticed a change in his breathing the spring allergy season hit and there were no symptoms of either allergies or asthma so a light bulb went on in their heads they started producing more honey even giving some of it away and it turned out that we had something really serious going with the bees they love it out here in hunterdon county so we continued keeping the bees and selling the honey over time what point did you all decide hey we could do this for a living we can make money off this you know it was more for fun i was homeschooling at the time when we decided to start the business and i said well let's try to teach the children about making honey and starting businesses and so we begin to sell the honey at our local farmers market it's an artisanal market in stockton new jersey which we still love and we just started selling in person and having fun with the customers we're all about being around the people and then we got another place in bucks county and off to chelsea market in new york city the whole process was like very organic i i laughed that we had no intentions of being honey producers this unintended consequence led to zach and zoe's sweet bee farm honey which is sold all over the world their honey is raw always organic and comes in a variety of artisanal flavors which their global customers especially love we would come up with like cranberry honey or you know different things for christmas season pumpkin you know the harvest um pumpkin spice and different things um based on our american culture people want their honey they get very grumpy if you don't have their flavor in stock they're awesome you get some nasty emails if you don't have their honey in stock make no mistake beekeeping is a back-breaking business that means long hours in the hot sun or chilly mornings their business has seen its ups and downs especially with coronavirus and the lockdown but that's when summer and cam moved their sales mostly to online which has allowed them to get noticed by just about everyone they even got on one very special person's radar and let's just say this could be life changing for summer and cam is it accurate that you are now going to be part of oprah's favorite things for the season yes we're we're excited to be a part that oprah actually chose us to be on her oprah's favorite things list this year for 2020. we're still yeah floating on air about that and just imagine this all started as an experiment for summer and cam to help their son zach deal with severe allergies and asthma [Music] okay so an update shortly after my interview with summer and cam and family oprah yes oprah as you heard there reached out to surprise them take a look oh my gosh oh my gosh how many bees do you have 42 hives and well i love the packaging and we're very happy to be able to share it with the world so has final vote she has final vote i find the vote and i say i love your [Music] it was just all like all the stars aligned if you want to start a business you got to start a business that looks like a great life they've carved out amazing we're going to go back out there in the spring hopefully things will be better and

same always this honey is normally blended heated and refined before bottling to ensure standardization of taste texture and color however natural honey comes in many forms from dark amber to almost white from bitter to sweet depending on the type of nectar the bees feed on scientists today have proven beyond doubt that heated blended and refined honey has very little benefits compared to real honey at honey and spice we intend to bring back honey in its original form we do not heat blend or refine the honey which ensures all the benefits of real honey are intact our honey is straight from the beehive to the bottle how do we achieve this our tribal honey hunters look for wild beehives in the forests to harvest rare and exotic wild honey while the tribal folks are at their thousand-year-old job our beekeepers migrate their bee colonies according to the season letting the bees feed on the nectar of german archaea and rosewood flowers to make our popular unifloral honey varieties each bee colony is carefully maintained by the beekeeper ensuring an increase in the bee population which is crucial for the future of the planet this honey made by the bees is then

know she's here there's evidence of her laying so yeah i'm not going to go into that [Music] hey guys zeke man here today we're gonna be checking out some hives up here in goshen connecticut with my new friend chris really appreciate his hospitality here and showing me around in the ways of the [Music] bees [Music] okay this is going to be sting therapy here guys chris is taking one for the team boom right in the knuckle oh watch that now it's going to pulse oh i'll quickly kill the beast so they don't suffer gone oh right yeah so that'll pulse the venom in now you can control it by pulling that out and rubbing it and getting rid of it you know but i'll take the full boat which is going to swell up the knuckle it's good for arthritis but i've been doing it to myself down the elbow down the arm so now if i take one during the day like right in like a day ender yeah the pain's nowhere near as bad as it used to be because i'm getting i'm getting used to it so it's like it's crazy but it works too yeah there's like lifetime proponents of it i mean don't get me wrong that hurts right now of course i do like a whole like so these guys are those two cells i was the two framers i was talking about okay so what i did was i took one box and made four ah so these guys i had a virgin on eight five she has to fly she has to go get mated oh okay she has a chance of a heavy chance of predation and weather killing her so what we're looking for is to see that she got back healthy and started laying eggs all right which would be sweet and then i will do a late split with whoa oh they're pretty docile for the most part it's a little late in the season so they get a little pissy yeah always check the top make sure there's not like a virgin or somebody running around if they start flying yeah and you start getting them in your face your ears your eyes whatever just uh do a shake like this back off yeah try not to trip over the wire over there then you can flip the hood over your head oh i didn't even i didn't even realize it won't bug you but if you're gonna get in close depends on it tim can you get the hood i didn't even realize there was a yeah i was like i'm going in raw here dogging it all right oh thanks ah there we go yeah i was like all right nothing like a first experience going in without a hood move together here's my first visitor right here yeah she's got the tongue out yeah cleaning its tongue yeah yeah yeah so the good news is i haven't seen um by doing this this is why i don't do this uh-huh i'm getting the queen inside there yep so just she's running around oh really which makes it harder for them to you know to find them yeah the problem is i'm just gonna it's so small and there's so many bees i'm either gonna crush a lot or get stung in the fingers a lot or both yeah just to try and get this out of here which there you go whoa okay is that a live one nope okay they don't take too kindly to you smashing them no i bet all right let's see wow holy cow yeah i'll get you a good shot i just want to make sure so what's happening here see these yeah okay those are clean cells that emerge so a virgin comes out then she kind of runs around the frame she's healthy enough and not messed up she'll go fly to go get mated and then you gotta find them which i'm not seeing i used a lot of smoke there's a ton of bees in this box you can see there's a ton down there their wings are going like crazy like they don't have a queen so oh you can tell see how they're flapping yeah yeah yeah like some of them you'll see them they'll put their butts up in the air yeah like usually on the front of the hive i can't doesn't really seem like they're doing it so much but some are summer yeah they have a glance like that right there they'll put a nason off pheromone or whatever comes out of that rear end gland and they start fanning so the queen's either on this frame where i can't see her and they know she's gone or she's dead because she got crushed oh no don't worry that didn't happen or she wasn't there right like they came in which could be another thing she could be off on a mating flight right now right so what i'm trying to do is see now if you look inside the frame oh you told me if you got the light you could see the bottom of them yep you're looking for rice that's what an egg looks like oh okay looks like a little grain of rice sitting up vertical and we don't see any no so another laying queen on here i do have pollen you can see the yellow oh okay and then this is all honey yeah so to do pollen and honey and then she'll lay in the middle of that oh nice so what we're trying to do is find oops see here frame totally fell off oh man that they started laying on it and it attached oh that's just a shame because i'm gonna have to mess with that hopefully she could have got crushed in between oh no yep so this is just a cluster go all the way around here oh no damn it going to pull this up out slowly see what happened it was a foundationless frame oh man it was beautiful too it was all secured down at the bottom yeah i see that probably braced it cross calm to the wall of the housing and it just split that sucks that's so much work too so much work for them and yeah and now i'm gonna have to get in there later and try and fix that and you know if there was a mated queen on there hope i don't see any eggs in here anyways but what i'm gonna do is try this see that's like right to the it must have fell and then they secured it yep if i was wearing long socks and afraid of the tickle yeah and the bees on me then they get stuck their little tarsals get stuck in the the fur of the sock and then they when they get stuck they get kind of anxious and they'll stink their way out oh man you get stung for having you know you might as well just let them climb on you yeah or you can wear a suit when it's 90 degrees screw that yeah it's hot in here but that's all right i feel comfortable i'll put it on what i'm going to do is piss everybody in that box off this maneuver have you got stung yet not yet well yet today yet today i'm sure you've been stung over and then oh didn't mean to do that came out with it [Music] what i'm going to try and do is fish that out grab her and put her in a cage look at this they're eating that i think they're eating it anyway oh yeah they're gonna go and they're gonna pull plus they're all coated with sugar and stuff and stuck so they're all like pissed off stuck to each other yeah you can't move you know so anytime a animal gets stuck insect gets stuck like that they fight right they pull away from each other see how they're kind of trying to clean each other off and then these ones are all over here doing their whole flappy wing thing i'm just seeing if i could find her on the box right she could be off on a mating flight right now too so that would be helpful and then come back to the wrong box later right because she's gonna orient to that one there's clumps everywhere what i really gotta do is just get under here with a spade and pull all the sticky comb out i'll throw it in there this over here is amazing me this little clump here so i don't see anything here unfortunately the other thing this is going to do is encourage a ton of robbing because all the other ones that are hungry they automatically like you so you transferred the bees in that box will they automatically take to that box no no they're going to want to go fly back to this guy with the frame on it but they're all they're all pretty well kind of hugging oh yeah if i put a frame in there the problem is i gotta scoop that up they're all trying to eat it right there's the possibility of a queen somewhere in there that i'm proudly smashed i could find her on okay see how they're all stuck and gooey and their wings can't move aggravating pissed off oh man yeah i mean they'd be stinging me if they could all pissed off i mean this is about the dumbest thing i could have done in front of you so you're getting a really good you know education on what not to do yeah but i mean this is what happens when you go foundationless the fount the stuff that they build out all this all this wax they're gonna fill it up with like eight pounds of honey right right so then there's nothing holding it in the middle so when the secured honeycomb breaks around the edges which it does sometimes especially if you handle it poorly or if they brace comb it to the side and then you go pulling it out which is exactly what happened here it started getting attached to the side of the box right wrench it out and then all of a sudden it just the weakest point goes clip yeah and you get the hole and that's what happens yeah with foundation you'll have plastic in the middle and it won't do that or it won't do it anywhere near as bad right what that was a total collapse so what i'll do is i'll just let them rob this out and feed it back to them you can see there's all pollen in there and the bees are pretty well engorged and smooshed so this has a cap you can put a marshmallow in there or fondant sugar right they call these hair roller cages is that what they look like yeah you can cage them up in that it gives them a little hiding space give them space to touch each other and feed through this is a queen clip it's like a little clip the bees can get through but the queen her thorax is too big her abdomen's too big she can't make it through this is like the smaller version like if your mate you know if you had queen uh eggs you can have them hatch out into there for a virgin queen use these like when i go through hives i use them to if i see the queen i can put her in there put her on the side protector and i can move a little more efficiently through the hive if i'm doing manipulations messing around that way you don't end up putting her in another box accidentally or crushing her accidentally it's real sticky it's like tree resin oh yeah we call it propless bee glue supposed to be anti-bacterial anti-fungal anti-everything yeah wonderful creations there we go there you go that right there there's a nice little hand-sized brood pattern because they're up in the top box and they're kind of getting small for winter you got honey stores capped stuff that they're building out a ring of pollen and that's what they'll eat throughout the winter yeah you don't rob it from them the problem is you got to leave them something to make it through winter right so there's no eggs on this frame it's just capped brood what they do they go from egg to larva and then to the cap stage and they hatch out in 21 days there's a good shot can you see in there we found the queen here i don't okay right oh yeah yeah yeah here oh don't mess with her i'm gonna mark her because she lost her marking and i want to be able to find her so come here whoa over there there's a blue pen [Applause] the trick is not killing her right i want to pinch her oops we got you by your wing larva little worms where's that right in the middle right there can you see it yeah you see anything that looks like rice on the outside edges little puddles of wet puddles are wet i see all right so the puddles are wet or when the rice hatches they go from eggs to 12 or 20 full 24 to 24 hour old larva yeah that coincidentally when you would pull it to uh breed queens you would take and graph those little they look like little puddles you can barely make out the larva yet yeah you can't make out the egg anymore because it hatched oh that's cool once she's done laying i'm optional yep actually this isn't found it this is a wax foundation these are pretty delicate too so you gotta be careful ton of brood right yep see these lines yeah that's the wire from the wax they won't lay on it you can see it's in its pattern yeah so yeah she laid up this whole thing let's see if she's on here they don't like the light usually they'll beat feet and hide in the corners or underneath the other worker bees and then would you just kind of flip it over real quick and see if you can catch her running from the light shaking yeah it's braced at the bottom oh man yeah this is a bad frame to be messing with spinning around but this is all nectar yummy we like the nectar yeah it's a good picture she probably wouldn't be on this frame anyways it's something you got it um nice beautiful half capped that's like paper white bin and they're building a little brood down here yeah and then the other side of that one this was a foundation i put in probably 10 days a week ago i don't have to worry about knocking her around so what's going on here this is weird i got some drone yeah and the pattern's all funky uh-huh she might be laying screwy there might be a problem with her or they might not be they might be filling this back in and she might not be laying and she could be laying down there but this is a suspect pattern the drone pull them out that's the male bees yeah looking to see if there's like a lar uh what you call it varroa mites on them i don't see any eggs inside of that pattern either right so that was bad yeah this is why you don't want to wear shorts that maneuver is going to give me stuff oh boy let's give him a second oh ho boy she's a drone layer and here's the problem with drone queen drone or men like they're the uh yeah so this queen's gotta go that's just a bad queen really yeah she turned drone layer on me so she probably got poorly mated right but it's pretty cool that is cool yeah sometimes they don't exactly build it straight yeah it's kind of oh yeah yeah doing its little thing there and when it's really really hot outside and you got like a hundred bees hanging on and you start moving it like this it'll bend and fall off oh man i'm gonna throw that in there oh i see yeah oh she might be getting pinched bad b she's not doing anything yeah that looks beautiful yeah she's about 100 done on that side and pretty damn close over here to go through winter i feel heavy it is yeah got it yep wow eight or nine pound yeah pretty heavy that'll hatch out in a few days and she'll hopefully get mated wow that's so cool yeah so they're doing that everywhere because she's not laying right that was a few days ago so i should have like a little queen cage it's either going to be here or here and i'm looking for her and i'm looking for her laying eggs do we see a queen this one see they seem a lot calmer in this box yeah when they're not you know running around trying to find that's what makes me think queen is released that's what 50 60 yeah okay yeah they're just kind of chilling in this one yeah they're just hanging i don't see any eggs on that frame nothing legs on that frame but they're calm they're not running around if i smoke them they'd be running around like crazy right yeah that's why i try not to do it wow that's a full one is it i didn't even see that side is it full of honey or brood funny wow yeah that's old too you know the older and darker it gets pollen stained they travel on it they're walking at it right now so their feet could pollen uh propolis on it so it stains it darker that's how you can tell this is older honey than that white stuff we were looking at before awesome right this is going into winter yeah this is good it's got a little bit of brood in there uh we got some larvae in the middle you can't really see it because it's so dark but okay i don't see a queen roaming this frame plus this is already laid out so she's not going to be on there anyways for the most part so she's just another bee there she is nice and fat so i got a queen she should be laying and she is playing looks like she's laying pretty decent i'll pull that off get it out of there there's no reason for it to be in there [Music] [Applause] [Music] anymore [Music] [Music] so [Music] hey guys thanks for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed watching all these bees we uh saw a lot of things and those queen bees how they're marked and and how everyone responds is really really cool anyway please like share and subscribe for some future zeke man videos

dating back to 1300 BC the cross-pollination of bees touches many things that we eat every day Texas beehives produce hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in Collin County and McKinney are at the center of that production USBS contribute over 18 billion dollars to in pollination so beekeeping responsible for over 18 billion dollars worth of the agriculture and Texas were in the hundreds of millions and without without bees you could basically throw away one out of every three bites of food or you can go buy a dozen apples and you could throw two thirds of them away like all farm products weather plays a big part of the production bees don't like rain the honey varies depending on where you get it so for example we produce honey lots of honey all over the place and also saw strictly in Texas but for example honey in Houston is usually a very dark honey and a stronger tasting honey honey from here is usually a lighter milder tasting honey sometimes and it can even vary year to year depending on the rains which denote what kind of flowers come up the mckinney area is a pretty good place for hobbyists to be you can make 40 to 60 pounds of honey for a high up on a good year the honey you see being extracted here are sold in historic downtown mckinney so many people come in here looking for the local honey because they want to take advantage of the allergy benefits that it can help with I have people who just like clockwork come in here and they get it because it makes such a difference for one of our focus is in this business here is that we want to try to help support local guys because we're a local little guy just like the produce at McKinney's farmers market it makes sense to buy local it's fresher it's tastier because it doesn't have to travel as far it's easier on the environment and if you look closely you can actually see it being made and that's pretty cool Amy Rosenthal McKinney vision", "8139KJ8aKFA": "hey everybody this is David at barnyard B's trying to get them a camera set up here first today's video shouldn't take long this should be a pretty quick video and what we're talking about today is your honey and extracting your honey well this is actually after you extract this is filtering your honey so today's video is gonna be pretty quick and easy and simple and what would honey it's been extracted so it's still got pieces of wax capping a little bee parts B legs stuff like that which is just how this is what you get when you extract honey and you cut off the comb and such so anyway this is quick simple and easy and what we've got we've got tea five gallon buckets that's work that the honey sealed it off so I get ready to filter it and get you one of these five gallon buckets with a honey gate on it comes in very handy this bucket doesn't have one and what you want to filter it with this is so quick easy simple is it's a paint filter from Lowe's and you can see the size you can buy these for a couple dollars and it's just the perfect size it doesn't over filter it it's just perfect it works great you stretch it over your bucket make sure your honey gates tight and now it's heavy so you may have to use get a couple people to tell you it's easier when you're doing it on the ground I'm doing it up high so I can demonstrate where you can see you can see a lot of the imperfections in it so let's see if I can do this without this is really heavy so you're gonna have to have some help doing this there we go dumping it in get a little bit on my hand it's okay won't hurt it you pretty much like I said normally don't do this and I normally don't spill it on my hand like I just did but for video demonstrations I've got a little bit on my hand my hands are clean and now the bees are gonna attack me so now what you can do they do make a wire space that's cut it's a bucket holder that you can get you don't have to have that you could actually if you wanted to just set it down on there upside down let's F well I'm gonna do that right now and what I'll do what's left over it's dirty in the bottom anyway I'll let the bees clean that after yellowjacket trying to get me now the filtering process is easy as this here's my filter Milo's filter you basically just start pulling up on your your builder like this I know it wouldn't take long for the used to come after me now I don't have it right here but what would be good if you could actually suspend this over your bucket for a while until you get all the honey out now this bucket it's full now it's look at the bees coming already this is something you normally don't do outside but I want to get lighting when people would be able to say it's a this is it will be a disaster actually if you did this outside for very long so here they're kind of Yellowjackets and honey bees do this inside now I'm not gonna sit here and hold this for a long time but you got the idea what to do it's a simple quick as that you've got a five-gallon bucket a strain honey that fast and all I did was pull the filter back up out of there and you can see the the pieces of wax all the stuff you don't want in your honey and it's done this filter it's it's cleaned and it's it doesn't filter too much to where you still have your little pieces of hall and your essentials that you need in your honey so like I said you'll take this and and hang it up somewhere if you have a way to hang it to let the rest of it drip in if you got clean hands I do have clean hands you could actually squeeze it down a little bit and get the rest of it in there I'm not gonna do that I'm actually there just maybe I prayed lose a cup total but it actually won't be lost because the bees won't clean it up so it goes right back into the hive and that's about it you put your lid on like so and then when you want to pour out you pour out a quart 2 quarts at a time however you won't do it it's that easy and not gonna fund the other man but that's it please like and subscribe please pass these videos along to the new beekeeper anyone that's interested beekeeping we try to get out our ideas as as many people as possible on YouTube spread them however you like on

"ninety percent of all the honey in Canada soul that is consumed by everybody is from canola lion primarily from Alberta and they use the bees to propagate the genetically modified plan okay our organic bees now are feeding on thousands and thousands of different plants and people don't realize a lot of nectar also comes from a tree specially in the spring with natural plants and spraying out a lot of moisture the roots aren't going very far into the soil so they gives you a very white white sweet honey and as snow as the summer progresses and it gets drier and hotter the plants are the roots are going deeper into the ground and that will be exposed to different minerals and stuff so the honey will taste different from me you know June July and August hey Dan can you take us through the process in which you you make the honey basically this is what's sitting on a beehive okay and this is isolated from Queen so that the the Queen cannot lay her eggs in the coal typically we'll have nine or ten frames and this is pretty much what it looks like straight out of the video commercial process they would feed them through an automatic machine and they would be using our their metal hot knives or heat it up to 200 degrees or more what we do now to keep it unique is we use a hand comb we actually open the high the frames like this with a comb and then from there I would take this frame I would open the other side also and this frame goes into this machine here which is actually a spinner so now it filled ass up a bunch of frames and then this unit will spin around and what happens certificate the honey will run from the inside of the comb out along the side of the stainless steel Oh edge and then run down into a bit of a hopper there this is funny that we extracted today Wow oh my gosh we then let it sit and normally in a commercial process this would immediately go will be heated by heat they would separate the wax we don't we never hit our honey and then we will transfer into a series of tanks that are behind you here we go into stainless steel and we basically go through three racking stages without any filtering at all so by the time we get into the third tank the honey's crystal clear on the last stage we do put it through a little screen just to ensure that it is completely clear this third tank now is it's a bow two weeks later okay similar like racking morning we were filling our jars by hand for the last several years wow it would take probably 15-20 minutes to do a case and so here we go that's awesome I want to stick my listen to that that was so fun Wow so we put the lid on and they had one more certified ecocert label that goes on the top I'll let you put the label on it oh wow look at it go there we go you can have that jar for your efforts thank you thank you very much one taste it sure yes this was from June this will have a lot of tree blossoms mm that's a wow that's it's delicious I don't want to say that it's like maple syrup but it's this year the silver maple they have a red but that comes out and then we're still snow on the ground and the trees were just fuzzy allow these is from the month of of July you know the honey will never be the same next year it's all seasonally dick too week oh my gosh there's an incredible difference amazing I wanted to say sweeter but its largest your honors world yes yes there's a little bit more strong flavors yes that's incredible well this would be last three weeks okay yeah and it's from a different Avery it's not as strong as a second one my gosh they're all delicious Wow so if you want to go to the bees we should go before it's too late yes matron here is about 92.3 degrees Fahrenheit Wow and they maintain that says it was amazing but if you look at the bees here closely to see that bleep be there it's pretty black yeah lots of Russian be really this one here with a yellow but on it that that's an Italian be are you serious dead sir Italian being volume V so we have primarily blue Russian bees we used Russian bees for a couple reasons one because they're very hygienic be and because we don't use any products or chemicals it gives us the best chance of the be surviving okay my two guests over here my show we're gonna do we're going to look into some very very young highs okay and these are called nooks for Nicholas eyes all right this is a very very young hi the Queen will be in one of the main frames I'm going to give them a little bit of smoke here smoke is used because naturally when there's a forest fire in the world and the bees that would be living in the trees they sense the smoke and they realize that you know their colony is basically doomed and when they sell the smoke their natural instinct is to gorge themselves on honey stop defending the hive and you as much honey as they can so that they can fly as far as they can with the energy and when the fire gets closer they will actually take the Queen and they will fly as a swarm out of the fire ring to start a new a new life somewhere and that's organic smoke is that right that's correct we don't burn string we don't burn cardboard it's organic pine needles and little bit target in there so we're gonna slide a frame out here and we're basically taking a slice right out of their home it's blowing me away that you're doing this with your bare hands oh my god so this is a an active frame yeah these are the cocoons and here's a bee being born wow so he's on his way out ok that's a female be how can you tell because of the size of companies are mailed easier drone bees oh okay and interesting enough the female bees have to do this on their own and the male bees the women come and get them out really oh they start out as house keeping bees and the key behind clean and then they start producing wax if he can produce either honey or wax or propolis and propolis is is dark stuff here around the high well here's a new friend that they've done you can see all the babies yeah and then here's the wax on the outside it's a lot of babies as I mentioned before she can lay up to 2,000 a day 2008 yeah cuz she see she doesn't like the light so if it was the dark she'd be walking around trying to find where to you know where she wants to lay eggs and she's probably going to take a beeline to to hide Wow very verbal you this close to these there we are in the smoke so this is what I was talking about so this is where the Queen lives in these two chambers as the chamber we leave with all the honey ensure that their organic and they're healthier meals and here you see this piece is called a queen excluder okay and then this is where we finish the honey that's completely isolated oh and you said there's about a hundred thousand bees in here yes Wow the noise is so deeply that's before we sign off we always ask our guests to ask our viewers a question so if there's a question any question all you want to ask our audience in any subject whatsoever anything at all it doesn't have to be about bees or honey what kind of question could that be good honey yes why would you not try organic honey i love it you've never had it how is that for her that's an awesome question perfect and you know where you can get it right here that's right so Dan and Nina thank you so much so much more for having us here today this was fantastic you're very well

sanctuary like this free of any sort of pesticides chemical fertilizers you know they really they really can thrive some of the there's great health benefits to eating local honey and you can't you know and it's mostly when it's raw and unpasteurized honey like this is you get all of the local pollen in it which is a huge benefit for immune systems and for out people that have allergies or asthma if you struggle with hay fever eating local honey and getting small amounts of that pollen naturally into your system is very helpful the raw local aspect because then you're getting the pollen that is from your area it doesn't mean oh good to build a resistance to weeds and flowers that are grown in northern China you know so there's no health benefit to eating sucrose that is shipped in in a barrel from China it doesn't get any more local than your honey pollinating eating honey that was pollinated on the same farm in the same pasture as your beef your or your hogs your chicken it all is all for the same farm this is one of the rotational pastures and so this is obviously very heavy and clover it's very heavy in alfalfa our pastures have never been sprayed or never had a chemical fertilizer on them and the only time they've ever been seated is during the initial seeding of converting them back to pasture from row crop fields and so everything on here has been naturally this has all been naturally fertilized and receded through rotational grazing through that sort of mob stocking grazing controlled grazing system that we run here small paddocks have a lot of animals in a tight space for a short amount of time that's that's basically how we do it what I call perennial polyculture if you take care of it this will be here forever and it'll only get better every year", "vZG3ane0WFw": "hello welcome to Florida genuine raw honey I'm a beekeeper all of my honey is raw honey which means it comes directly from our hives into the jaw we don't a radiate pasteurizer filter unlike store-bought honey which has to be filtered which means it is heated to 120 to a hundred and fifty degrees so it will flow easily into the bottles this is a local honey but it comes from Colorado this one here is kind of unique because it comes from Canada Russia and Mexico it has the word meal mie el which is Spanish for syrup we have one here from Argentina in Brazil and it's pasteurized this one is the most unique it says raw and unfiltered filtering honey means that has to be heated to 125 to 150 degrees so it can't be raw and as it says gently filtered filtered honey radiates the pollen the live enzymes and the propolis what they've done by heating is create an artificial sweetener there is no nutritional value and processed pasteurized heated and filtered honey so when you're buying honey in stores remember you're getting an artificial sweetener there's no nutritional value if you want a nutritional value when a honey you see a beekeeper we harvest by hand we process by hand and we job by hand we don't do any heat pasteurization or filtering stop by and see us would love to see you and we'll explain everything there is to know about our honey's thank

nose itchy eyes you know the usual stuff and some get hit harder with those symptoms than others very bad so I started taking I started taking shots of you know therapy for that and that's helped and similar to how those allergy shots work there's widespread belief that eating local raw honey can help those symptoms by regularly exposing you to pollen we caught up with the co-owner of hilltop apiaries in Simsbury where they extract honey for sale so that's the best is when the honey comes right from the hives hasn't been pasteurized hasn't been filtered that's the best thing for allergies and to help with the immune system if somebody has a cold flake farm is home to one of the pollination yards where honey is polled and behind me is one of those pollination yards it's very active very cramped and full of honey that could provide that much-needed relief and it's believed the unprocessed honey can help desensitize people with pollen allergies well there's a lot of good things in it you know and it tastes good and it's really good for you the trick isn't how the honey is heated by not raising it above that 120 range it doesn't burn off any of the pollen or beneficial enzymes that are within the honey and while honey can lessen seasonal allergy symptoms those results haven't always been consistently found in scientific studies according to Mayo Clinic you also shouldn't give

federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like

clover and 1b1 clover and a bead and reverie the reverie alone will do if bees are few if you are looking for miles and miles of wide open prairie covered with millions upon millions of clover flowers then North Dakota is the place to go many people might be surprised to learn that North Dakota is the number one state in America for honey production the reason is incentives simply economics really the US Department of Agriculture has a program that pays farmers to improve marginal land the goal of the program is to reduce erosion improve water quality and create new wildlife habitat North Dakota has plenty of marginal land and sweet clover has turned out to be just what the land needs to improve sweet clover is cold tolerant and once established can survive on very little water mature clover also receives itself dropping seeds that will germinate to produce next year's crop best of all honeybees love it and so each summer beekeepers from all around the country move their hives to North Dakota with the bees feast on the clover nectar it is a win win win for all the farmer gets a return from previously unused land the land gets stronger and supports more wildlife and we'd get clover honey this is not your typical grocery store clover honey most grocery store honey has been pasteurized by heating it to 160 degrees or even more and then pushed at high pressure to fine mesh filters the resulting product is clear but totally devoid of flavor and nutrition rock clover honey is a different product entirely we have gently warmed the honey to 104 degrees and then used a large mesh screen to remove bits of bees and beeswax only as a result the honey retains all of the pollen vitamins minerals and enzymes that make raw honey such a wonderful product as far as taste this clover honey is something special when we first sampled the honey on a hot day in August it had been sitting in a UPS truck for a while and honey was quite warm as the honey played in our mouths we looked at each other with wide eyes and then exclaimed apple pie this honey has distinct flavor notes of both apple and cinnamon when warm it really does taste a lot like apple pie try some you'll see you", "louZ4ogKd9w": "hey what's going on everybody hope you having an energized day and today I want to talk about this product positive energy that had a chance to try this week and share with you my experience should you be in the market for a energy supplement to get you through the day this is by YS eco bee farms and I will put a link in the description along with other information so you can also read what other reviews there are that people of the experience that they've had and order it a lot of very positive reviews on the product and at high expectations with going in and trying it this company is organic pioneer since 1995 this is supposed to have stamina endurance vitality super dynamic integration before I share with you about my experience let me first show you the capsule it is a capsule and the recommendation is to take two either once or twice a day so that is the capsule for some that might be too big for me I was able to easily swallow it so give you an idea there so it's got quite a number of supplements and again it says as a dairy dietary supplement take one or two capsules once or twice day preferably with meals before I'm sorry between meals for optimum results take regularly by the way it also says note B products may cause an allergic reaction in sensitive people and so there might be some that do have that reaction to be product so be cautious and also maybe check with your medical professional to ask about this product but it is got quite a number of natural ingredients so it's got royal jelly B pollen super activated propolis and printe sorry if I came for an ounce some of these correctly it's got two times equivalent to 100 milligrams it also has eleuthero american ginseng korean ginseng as long as wow ganda which is a root as strong Laguz root I'm sorry again if I'm not pronouncing these right it's got this floaty which is another root gotu kola suma which is another route go to colas and herb morena is a full spectrum it's got this broken cell wall chlorella and ginger and licorice root other ingredients gelatin and magnesium stearate so hopefully that might be of help as far as you know what to expect sighs pill taking it and ingredients but as far as my results for taking it I really had some high expectations based upon the reviews so when I first started taking it I felt good at first but then as over the course of the last several days I just wasn't feeling that energy and I had purchased some 5-hour energy shots because right now I'm having my teeth whitened and I got off coffee which does work well but I also have a sensitive stomach and while you're whitening your teeth you don't want to drink coffee so I ended up finding that I had to take some 5-hour energy even a half a bottle just to give me an additional boost and then it kind of felt like I was more energized but as far as just taking the product alone really did not do what I was hoping that it would give me that boost of energy for some it may work very well everybody's different you got different chemistry obviously in your body and you might feel different symptoms but for me I just didn't feel like it did enough for me the store that I bought it at to try it out if it doesn't work you could try something else and there's a honey product him I try but we'll see so I just wanted to give you my thoughts on the product but again I do recommend learning more about it by clicking on the link seeing the reviews and if you want to give it a shot go ahead and order it alright everybody have a great day be energized be safe

information on honey how its cultured and whether or not it's organic which I think you all want to hear about good afternoon everybody we're here at the free market Richard honey is an unregulated food source so producers and wholesalers or anything that they want to on the label without regulation they do that in order to charge higher prices our money is all-natural pure raw honey which is the important thing to make sure you get raw money from the producers which ensures the highest quality and that you get all of the health benefits that are in what is the healthiest honey that you can recommend well that's a great question there's many different varieties of honey and each one has its own particular medicinal value for example the wildflower honey is great for allergy relief the saw palmetto honey is great for your immune system and the orange blossom honey is like a multivitamin it has the highest concentration of trace pollen in it which is one of the things that makes raw honey so good for you okay that's awesome and you work for are you on the company and where's your company in West Palm Beach a 3311 South Dixie Highway between Belvedere and southern we are a retail store and we also produce all this honey ourselves we're very excited I have one more question I've been told that if you have allergies and you eat honey from the place where you live that it will get rid of your allergies that true that's correct and that's why we recommend wildflower honey because wildflower has the broadest spectrum of trace pollen in it and it's traced pollen in the honey that helps you build your immunity to airborne allergies awesome thank you so much I think that was so informative I really honestly don't believe that people understand the way you know honey is cultured and you know when I personally asked you if was it organic and Wow shocking so we're gonna get two bottles one for the office next on real estate exact downtown West Palm Beach and one for

and today we are going to get a tour of how you farm and grow bees and also what bees contribute to the food on your plate so our tour guides for today are going to be tommy magnus and greg and they are going to teach you all that you need to know about honeybees so good good afternoon as sarah said my name is tommy and i'm here to tell you a little bit about the importance of our honeybees here in the united states we have lots of crops that require a lot of our fruits and vegetables such as cucumbers watermelons cantaloupes peppers tomatoes squash pumpkins a lot of those and almost all of them apples included require honeybees to pollinate so we can actually get the fruit they they'll take pollen from one flower and put it on another flower and that causes us allows us to get fruit otherwise our if we did not have honey bees we'd have the only things we'd have at grocery stores or stuff like corn wheat potatoes regular white potatoes so it's not it for lots of diversity we do need honeybees to help us pollinate our crops as you can see what we're wearing are these protective suits that mainly protect our face and that is because if we get stung a bee will find you because it releases the scent and that's more bees that will come on to you by putting these this um bee suits or veils on as greg's wearing you can see that um it protects our face so that bees don't get up in our face because they are attracted to the co2 that you emit when you breathe so that's why they go straight there and a honeybee sting to your face is very very painful all right so what we're looking at is the queen the way you can tell the difference is her body's longer and than a worker and we have painted a little dot on her to make her easier to find so we kind of draw a little crown on her so we can find the queen and her job she's only got one job and she is the mother of every bee in the hive so she lays eggs all day long and she can lay 1500 to 2000 eggs a day and that's her job and she's being taken care of by the other bees and they feed her and clean her and take care of her this dude she's stuck at the sea or sticking her head down into holes if you watch she sticks her head in the hole and if it's empty so see she stuck her head in the hole she's looking for empty cells and if she finds an empty cell then she'll lay an egg in it see she's looking in it but it was there was something in it so she's going to go and she looks in another one see her looking in it it was full so so she's going on looking for another one that's what she does all day all day and night long all right so what we're looking at here is a frame of honey so the bees make the honeycomb they draw out the honeycomb and it's almost like little jars that they stack together and what they do they take collect nectar and then they turn that into honey they store it in the cells and when it's ready to be stored they put wax on top it's kind of like when the food is ready or the food is ready you put a lid on the jar and store it in your pantry so that's what the bees have done they've stored honey in these and they put a lid on it with wax so that doesn't go bad and then when in the winter when they need it they can take the wax off and eat it all right so here we're looking at a drone which is what the boys are called and they have you can tell their drones because their body is bigger is rounder he's got really big eyes compared to his sisters and the drones don't do much around the house so they don't cook they don't clean their job is all they do is when they hang around at the hive get fed and then during the day they go out and hang around with other drones they fly around together and they look for a girlfriend and if they don't find one they come home and do the same thing next day so here we're looking at the workers they're all girls they're all sisters so the hive a big hive can have 50 000 sisters living together and the workers got their name because they do all the work so they they clean they collect food they build the wax they defend the hive so they do all the work in the hive now the drones when there's not enough food for the hive the girls will kick them out so they will stop feeding them and push them out the door and they will starve to death so it's not all good being a drone there are some drawbacks so the workers they do we mentioned all the different jobs they have work cleaning and protecting and collecting food they do a different job based on how old they are so just like how you you might help your parents you might help clean your room and then when you get older you might mow the yard outside so the bees do the same thing they have a different job depending on how old they are so the younger bees work inside the hive they they start out the very first thing that bee does when she emerges is to clean her room so that it's ready for the queen to lay another egg but they do different jobs based on how old they are then they graduate to taking care of the the babies the then they move on to drawing wax and one of the last jobs they do is foraging which is collecting food and they do that for until they die so that's the last job and they do that until they can't do it any longer when the bees are holding on to each other uh it's kind of like making a bridge almost it's called festooning and other insects do the same thing you know there are ants that do that they create a bridge with uh and climb on on their colony mates and i know some ants will build a little raft and they'll float across the water but bees they do that part of when they do that is when they're building wax so um but they hold on to each other and create a little bridge that other bees can climb on so honeybees are insects and like a lot of insects they go through a four stage metamorphosis so they have an egg a larva a pupa and an adult and if you think about it that's the same thing that a butterfly does so when you see a butterfly when you see a caterpillar the caterpillar is the same stage as the honeybees larva and then that caterpillar spins a cocoon and and makes and turns into a pupa and you've all seen that the cocoon and then when it emerges it emerges as an adult butterfly so honeybees follow that same life cycle honeybees are not native to north america so when the colonists first came over from england they found the continent with no honeybees and they were used to having honeybees where they came from they did a lot of work for them they made wax obviously honey and they pollinated their apple crops primarily so when they got over here and found out there were no honeybees one of the first things they brought with them in the 1620s was colonies of honeybees interesting thing i guess is they spread throughout the entire continent until they got to the rocky mountains but the rocky mountains were too cold and too high for the honeybee to fly across so they never colonized california and the western states until europeans brought them around the southern tip of south america and came to california and released them on the other side of the rocky mountains what we see here on the porch of the hive bees are just standing there facing inward to hive and they're fanning their wings what it's doing is it's pulling air out of the hive and trying to pull air through the hive to help cool it off because it's a little too hot this is a smoker and that's what we use when we're going to get in go into a hive so bees have to backtrack a little bit so bees communicate with pheromones which is a type almost like a scent so it's a smell so that's how the bees talk to each other they don't have mouths like we do or they can't bark like a dog so they they communicate with scents and one thing abee will do so if a bee realizes that something is wrong she she gets hurt or she realized hey there's a there's someone in here doing something they shouldn't she will communicate with her sisters by scent so well by using the smoker we cover up that scent so it's almost like if if i played really loud music in the classroom then you couldn't talk to each other so that's kind of how it works it also will make them think that there's a forest fire so they will go and start grabbing some of the honey so that they can take that with them if they have to leave so there's multiple things that the smoke does but it is another piece of equipment that we use to make keeping beast easier bees also need to collect water magnus said earlier they collect nectar and pollen from flowers but they also need water and they use the water not only to drink but also to cool the hive with it's kind of their air conditioning they they put they bring it back to the hive and put drops of water in the around in different places in the hive and then fan it with their wings and it evaporates and that cools the hive down we are here with greg who is the apiary committee chairman for the wilson county apiary where we have toured today and we're going to ask him just a couple questions about bee farming and what he enjoys about it so my first question for you is what is the number one thing you recommend to someone who wants to help honeybees so everybody can participate in helping honeybees and they do need help so the number one thing would be to plant flowers because honeybees have to have flowers to survive so all of their food comes from flowers and and also the honey they make for us comes from flowers so everybody can go out and plant a garden with and it doesn't take a lot just a few flowers to help any any of the honeybees out all right well that concludes our virtual farm tour of the bee apiary we hope that you've learned something about honeybees and value them as a vital part of our farming and agriculture industry if you registered for an activity packet you will find these three worksheets in that packet the first is identifying honey bees queen worker and drone as three different categories so hopefully you will find some information about that in the video you can also label the parts of the bead and finally you can complete this venn diagram describing the similarities and difference between bees and ants as insects there will also be an activity included that discusses the life cycle of the bee all of the information that helps fill out these worksheets can be found in the video so we hope that you enjoyed your tour and we look forward", "fwpbOHTBW0A": "good morning I'm Turkish and I'm representing croplife where we got together to establish a pollinator forum the idea behind this is ready to highlight our responsibilities for the various parts of the industry in agriculture first of all from the crop protection industry represented by a crop lock talking about what is our responsibility when it comes to free health and we also involved general agriculture industry organization like water grain a say and sub truck just to highlight from the aside what their responsibility is with regards to be health and then certainly the the V farmers to just identify what they responsibilities would be bringing all this together and really communicating this to agriculture in general so that we can really support healthy bee farming of obviously these are very important to agriculture particulars gar\u00e7a pollination so it's really good to have everybody here together and having the great support from growers and industry thank you i'm craig Campbell from a soulish candy industry organization Savior I'm a commercial beekeeper and today we've signed a document that is the pollination Charter where the chemical companies the growers of all the various crops have come together with the beekeepers to hopefully have more communications that you can prevent the losses of these to the misuse of chemicals lots of the problems that we have is simply the responsible use of chemicals but if there's good communication between farmers we can all work together and we went to the B losses that we have been having we feel it's a very important day in going forward and we hope that everyone will come on board and join us and all the beekeepers can work together and therefore their growers can work together and if the chemical guys work together we can only go forward you"}
